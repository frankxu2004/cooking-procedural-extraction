pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:00:07.270000,what are we going to have?,2
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:00:08.210000,"we 're going to have a traditional margherita pizza as done in naples italy, and we 're going to make it right here in our eight hundred degree oven.",3
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:00:15.900000,so this is the dough.,4
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:00:17.360000,"it ferments overnight darts off as an eight ounce ball, and you can tell.",5
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:00:21.580000,"it 's very loose in texture, and, that is.",6
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:00:24.580000,because the gluten has had a long time to relax in the refrigerator overnight and develop the nice bubbles that we 're going to see on the edge of the crust and then the tomatoes are a spanish can tomato very similar to a san marzano.,7
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:00:40.460000,"but not quite as sweet, i like it to have a little bit more acid than the san marzano, and then we have a handmade mozzarella cheese that 's made in los angelus to make it daily.",8
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:00:54.910000,and then extra virgin olive oil.,9
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:00:58.510000,so we 've placed the dough directly into the caputo flower that we import from italy.,10
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:01:03.550000,it 's the same flower that we make the dough with.,11
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:01:05.910000,"and then we give it a flip as i 've read in some, some manuals for italian pizza that are neapolitan style.",12
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:01:16.050000,they say this is something you have to do.,13
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:01:18.210000,in order for it to be traditional you have to actually dip it in the flower.,14
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:01:21.550000,although i 'm not quite sure.,15
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:01:23.610000,"but that 's what we do anyway, we sprinkle the surface and then real quick.",16
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:01:29.550000,we just give a squish with our palm and make it flat in the center.,17
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:01:34.600000,not really disturbing the outside edge and then with our fingertips.,18
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:01:37.960000,"we dimple the rest of the pizza, moving the pizza around definitely handmade, definitely handmade, not trying your best not to disturb the edge 'cause that 's where you 're going to get a lot of natural bubbles from the fermentation.",19
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:01:54.510000,"once you 've dimpled, you 're going to do a quick stretch, while you 're rotating.",20
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:02:01.730000,"you 're stretching the just the edge of the dough out and you 're trying your best not to disturb the center, the center generally stretches out on its own.",21
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:02:12.920000,you wo n't have to worry too much about it.,22
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:02:14.310000,"you really just stretching the edge, and you can see with not to much fanfare.",23
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:02:18.670000,we 've established a good diameter without too much.,24
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:02:23.090000,"pull back, you actually see almost not.",25
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:02:25.750000,"and then we 're going to put it, pick it up and put it on the backs of our hands and just let it kind of hang down on the backs of our knuckles.",26
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:02:37.100000,and then the diameter is even greater and we 've really not work too hard to get it that way and water in the dough in the dough is strictly.,27
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:02:50.890000,it 's the red bag.,28
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:02:52.120000,"if you want to look for it on amazon, and it has a particular content of ash and gluten protein that we prefer, and it is a double zero ground flour and salt water and instant yeast.",29
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:03:10.350000,"not active, dry, but instant and will give you the recipe for that later so after you stretch it.",30
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:03:16.050000,"this is basically the size, you do n't have to throw it or anything.",31
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:03:19.060000,just put it right onto our pizza peel that we 're going to use to get into our oven and then we 're going to put some sauce on it.,32
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:03:28.600000,this is our antonina tomatoes and the only thing that we do to this canned tomato is put a little bit of salt in it and elevate the salt level.,33
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:03:38,and that 's it.,34
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:03:38.600000,we puree it with salt and that is it 's about two.,35
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:03:43.190000,"do you want a quarter to two and a half ounces of sauce, and i 'm going to put the cheese on.",36
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:03:48.850000,"next and probably you guys will wonder why there 's not that much cheese on there and if you 've ever been, italy, you 'll know that they just do n't put a lot of cheese on their neapolitan style pizzas got this recipe from restaurants that i worked in i 'm not sure if you 've been to downtown disney.",37
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:04:08.180000,"but there 's, there 's a?",38

pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:04:19.170000,"so it 's just a haphazard, scattering that 's it.",41
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:04:23.090000,"that 's the only amount of cheese we 're going to put on there, and that she 's going to melt down real fast in the oven, and kind of spread out just a little bit.",42
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:04:29.400000,but not much it 's not an american style pizza where the whole thing is covered with cheese you taste more of the acid of the tomato and the extra virgin.,43
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:04:38.900000,"olive oil actors come out of the oven, and we put on here.",44

pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:04:54.100000,they just get a little bit charred.,48
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:04:56.860000,but not much as sometimes they even retain all their green color after they come out of the oven.,49
pizza marghetta,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,0:05:01.600000,so that 's all we do to the pizza and then we go into the other just going to place it directly on the stone and give it a shake.,50

potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:00:12.090000,i guess series and this is what i 'm making today.,1
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:00:16.760000,"they have sections in this book, well, they have all sections in the public domain cores or sides and all that stuff.",2
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:00:24.160000,"then after that, they have like a section where it breaks down kind of different types of food or different regions of the asian section, indian section italian sausage, and it gives you a couple of recipes.",3
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:00:34.950000,so i picked the asian section because i really love asian food.,4
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:00:39.040000,i love tofu.,5
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:00:40.410000,now we 're going to be making tofu and veggie pot stickers with a dipping sauce.,6
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:00:46.320000,i believe how many is it three pot stickers and one tablespoon of sauce is a hundred and thirty two calories.,7
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:00:55.060000,"so this is a very, very, very good dinner to eat this is not gonna give you a lot of calories and i actually went online, to better homes and garden to actually look up the recipe, when i could n't find the book, the pot stickers themselves are actually only eight calories per serving those extra calories you get comes from the dipping sauce.",8
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:01:19.580000,"so if you did n't want to use those, the dipping sauce and save on calories, you can actually do that, which will drastically change the calorie count for this.",9
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:01:29.030000,but let 's get into the ingredients first you have some tofu and this calls for half of an eight ounce package of tofu or roughly nine ounces my grocery store only carries one brand of tofu an one size which is the fourteen ounce size.,10
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:01:49.150000,so all you really need is nine ounces.,11
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:01:50.940000,"so if you have a fourteen ounce size, just a little bit more than half of that package.",12
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:01:55.470000,now i like to get the extra firm kind.,13
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:01:58.720000,"because the texture of it if you do n't care, or of your grocery store has a bunch of different types of tofu get whatever one you prefer.",14
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:02:08.770000,"but i'ma texture person, i like the texture of the extra firm also, you need to join this a good way to drain it if you do n't well, after you drain just a plain water out of the container on you need to drain it.",15
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:02:20.850000,"so it 's still not as moist if you have a tofu press that 's perfect if not take, your tofu and i should 've video this black forgot take you tofu and put it on some paper towel and then stack heavy things on top of it i put a pot and a couple of bowls on it and put some more paper towel on top and let it sit for about ten to fifteen minutes and see all that moisture.",16
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:02:43.920000,let me see if i can bring it out all of that got squeezed out of the tofu.,17
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:02:56.330000,"let me have two tablespoons of green onion about two small green onions chopped up one, one third cup of shredded carrot.",18
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:03:05.450000,one third cup of broccoli slaw anna.,19

potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:03:13.160000,"because that 's what i did, you can do that with the broccoli slaw.",21
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:03:16.810000,because all that is broccoli carrots and cabbage all that stuff is easy to freeze you supposed to have one tablespoon of plum sauce i had plum sauce that expired a year ago and i did n't realize it.,22
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:03:43.060000,"so here gives you a breakdown of the equivalent of it, note says three tablespoons, three tablespoons of egg whites approximately is one large egg, and i just need one egg white.",23
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:03:58.990000,so i 'm going to put two tablespoons.,24
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:04:01.310000,"because i 'm, i 'm assuming when they say the large egg there, including the yolk in it as well.",25
potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:04:06.310000,"so i 'm going to put two tablespoons for one egg, white OK guys, there 's one other thing.",26

potstickers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,0:04:25.570000,but i do n't like them so i did n't put them in.,29

burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:00:21.480000,"so wrong, i even have a hard time touching it, not even think, you 're cooking at that freezing burn.",1
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:00:25.980000,they 're completely dry there.,2

burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:00:37.320000,"for example, the one that i have right here it 's nice, bright, red, very fresh.",7
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:00:41.780000,but it 's extra lean.,8

burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:00:45.940000,it 's a boring burger.,10
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:00:47.270000,never season the meat ahead of time because what the salt actually does to the burger it starts on curing the meat.,11
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:00:53.240000,the texture is not the same you have ruining your burger.,12

burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:01:06.480000,and you will lose the juices from the burger.,15
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:01:08.350000,"if you overheat the fan, and you put the burger down at burger will never cook not even to the medium rare or medium side.",16
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:01:14.640000,the outside will be already burned never close the barn too.,17
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:01:18.800000,"early because they only get salan, rubbery and a final mistake that i see people doing is cooking is burgers and then really pushing it down on the grill and what you 're actually doing.",18
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:01:28.840000,there is squeezing out for the juices from the burger.,19
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:01:31.880000,the result you ending up with us in party very dry on a soggy bun that.,20
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:01:37,"so wrong now i 'm going to show you the right way how to do the best burger, first of all, you have to pick the freshest meat fat in a burger is.",21
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:01:47.270000,"so important because not only it adds, flavor put a burger.",22
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:01:50.420000,"but also, it adds that moistness look for some costly grind meat or buy a piece of meat and go to the extra work actually by hand, always think about using a nice piece of chuck or maybe some strip steak and then of course, the ultimate would be then.",23
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:02:08.430000,"the kobe beef, where really is the highest in fat content and as you make your party V adventures really think a little out of the box, mixing some ingredients into that ground meat.",24
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:02:19.440000,"for example, some sort mustard seeds some fresh herbs, some sauteed mushrooms, when you shaping, the burger always use a little bit of water on your hand.",25
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:02:30.190000,"so first of all, the burger and the meat does n't stick and you 're perfectly can shape.",26
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:02:35.180000,"that burger stuffing that burger either with the little blue cheese or really is going to work really well, or what i like to do or.",27
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:02:41.740000,so having a little bit of leftover show grips.,28
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:02:43.910000,"for example, i put ashore trips in the center of the burger that brings like the burger to its whole different order level, do n't even think on using audio board?",29
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:02:55.500000,"you , some canola oil, oil who really supports nicely the heat and how do you know that actually your pan is really to the right temperature is when the oil smoke slightly.",30
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:03:05.410000,the burger is probably the most important step.,31
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:03:08.100000,you put the burger in the oil serious means.,32
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:03:10.720000,"you seal it and buy ceiling and means all the juices are staying inside thing about cooking it like a steak before serving it, let it rest a little bit.",33
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:03:21.130000,so that the juices inside the steak burgers are distributed evenly.,34
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:03:26.520000,now comes the fun part.,35

burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:03:29.350000,"so you 're starting with the band, always toast the bun.",37
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:03:31.930000,"or the last moment, that 's how you get really the bread showing at his best and what i like really is picking a bun like shea butter, for example, which has a nice golden crust on top of it think about using elevated pistol, you can use the freshest tomatoes.",38
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:03:46.450000,"of course, but you really living it up, you can push it to using a little bit of silt pineapple, you can use it.",39
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:03:51.910000,karma lies onions.,40
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLgqS2A_y0,0:03:53,"so really the layers are if you do all the steps, right, you will end up with ultimate berg.",41
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:00:00.110000,talking about making sliders here that i got to start these beautiful potato rolls right here.,0

burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:00:11.920000,"i 'm going to start with these rules next i went to the deli, and it got some boars head american cheese.",2
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:00:17.750000,"if you 're going to go good why not go the best, of course, here.",3
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:00:20.640000,i got some ground round.,4
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:00:22.450000,let 's get started.,5
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:00:24.510000,"all right, so what i 've done here is laid down a double layer of aluminum foil.",6
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:00:27.780000,"if you ever really thick stuff, then.",7
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:00:29.690000,"yes , you can use one.",8
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:00:30.600000,"but unfortunately, i do n't right now.",9
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:00:33.170000,so the next step is take your ground beef that you 're making the sliders.,10
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:00:39.330000,so what you want to do is want to take your ground beef kind of lift it up a little bit thanks smooth it out.,11
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:00:50.220000,but you wanna make sure it does n't really stick you just kind of smoothing it out to the point to where you 're going to cut it into little square patties once you got it all planned out and you can use a rolling pin just use it lightly and i would recommend using wax paper instead of foil.,12
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:01:12.710000,"but i do n't have that not a problem, you can still use it, it will come up.",13
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:01:20.300000,what you 're doing now is that you 've made it flat enough.,14
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:01:22.550000,"is you 're making those actual beautifully fence slider, patties?",15
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:01:27.500000,you do n't want them to think.,16
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:01:28.630000,"otherwise , you 're just eating a small thick burger.",17
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:01:30.550000,"if you like it that way, go with it, but this is for sliders.",18
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:01:33.850000,so here we go take a knife and just start taking the edges like that.,19
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:01:39.360000,now you can use the extra meat to go ahead and reform it out and make more patties.,20
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:01:43.270000,"so , do n't think that you 're wasting any meat as you go along your knife?",21
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:01:49.860000,start cutting the edges and moving it aside.,22
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:01:54.090000,"i 'm going to finish this, and i 'll get back to you in a moment, and here 's the basic idea of what it looks like the simple square patties.",23
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:02:03.280000,you can solve them now.,24
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:02:04.610000,i prefer to salt them after they come off just because it 's all usually falls off.,25
burger,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBRrWd4DTo,0:02:11.170000,"so now you want to just toast those buns, put him under your broiler for like thirty seconds to a minute depending on how high have the rack and how strong your broiler is.",26

bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:00:40.440000,"but with this dish, i feel like it 's pretty easy to control how much you make.",8
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:00:44.320000,and you 're not wasting a ton of food.,9
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:00:45.890000,"this is kind of my take on a traditional korean dish called bibimbap, but before you guys say anything.",10
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:00:52.720000,i was not raised in a korean household.,11
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:00:54.460000,so i do n't know how to do the traditional style.,12
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:00:57.880000,but i feel like this kind of incorporates all the flavors that i really like that i typically have to get in a restaurant.,13
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:01:03.680000,"now when i said, that this was a cooking video i kind of use that term loosely, just.",14
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:01:07.030000,"because the only cooking that you really have to do rice in this video, i mean, you can add anything that you want to you could add meat if you 'd like.",15
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:01:14.740000,"but i did n't really do that i kind of just use all the stuff that i had at home, and i do n't have any meat.",16
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:01:19.030000,currently just cook your rice.,17
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:01:21.770000,this is the kind that i like to use right now.,18
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:01:23.900000,it 's a brown rice and you can use whatever rice you want you can use white rice using you brown rice.,19
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:01:28.600000,you can use gluten free you can use gluten whatever i am not a racist man.,20

bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:01:38.230000,"according to the directions on the back, whatever they may be and since i 'm only making this really for myself i 'm only going to do half a cup of the brown rice just.",23
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:01:45.360000,"because once cooked it makes about two servings which is perfect for me and the directions on my bag of rice say, that you should go ahead and add either butter oil to the pan.",24
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:01:53.280000,so i 'm just going to add a little bit of sesame E.,25
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:01:55.030000,"oil just to add a little bit of extra asian flavor in there, and then really all you have to do is make the sauce and the key to the sauce the main ingredient that you really ca n't substitute is the goat chuchon or i do n't know if i 'm leaving saying that right.",26
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:02:09.590000,but is korean red pepper paste and this is just a very common korean condiment try saying that five times fast.,27
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:02:16.170000,"but i see it a lot in korean cuisine whether it 's just on its own, or if you mix other things into it to kind of enhance the flavor i like to add honey as a sweetener 'cause on its own is kind of sweet.",28
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:02:26.810000,but it 's mostly salty and spicy and then i do add a tiny bit of soy sauce.,29
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:02:30.980000,but that 's totally optional.,30
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:02:37.090000,because sometimes i make.,31
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:02:38.390000,"it , with a little less honey, or i make it with little more sesame E oil, depending on how i 'm feeling.",32
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:02:42.910000,but it 's totally up to you.,33
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:02:44.530000,"now at this point, you can go ahead and cook any meat or vegetables or any other things that you want to add to it, it 's totally up to you.",34
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:02:50.550000,"it 's really good with like ground, beef or some sauteed vegetables.",35

bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:02:57.930000,so i 'm just going to add green onion and kimchi 'cause i do have kimchi in my fridge.,37
bibimbap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy5ypC9_cOs,0:03:02.990000,and then also i have an egg.,38

pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:04:02.790000,"so now to cook your pancakes, i 'm using an electric skillet.",34
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:04:10.060000,"if you have one of these turn your dial two, three hundred and fifty degrees fahrenheit that 's a hundred and eighty degrees.",35
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:04:17.580000,"if you do n't have this, just you can just use a frying pan on the stove.",36
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:04:20.710000,try to use heavy pan with a flat surface.,37
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:04:24.650000,you do n't want any warps in your pan.,38
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:04:27.130000,"because then you get uneven cooking, which we do n't want, and if you 're doing on the stove heat to medium, medium high, and what you can tell your pan is ready when you just take a little bit of water on your hands and just drop it on an oh kind of splatter that 's when you know, it 's hot enough.",39
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:04:48.010000,"so if you have to adjust your heat to get at the right temperature, and you might even have to adjust your heat as you 're cooking the pancake if it is cooking, too fast or too slowly, and just kind of upper down.",40
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:04:59.170000,now i 'm going to just spray with nonstick vegetable spray.,41
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:05:03.720000,"my skillet that kind of cuts down on your fat, if you 're worried about that.",42

pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:05:11.380000,"but you could use some oil or melted butter and you could either brush the oil or butter on with pastry brush or with a piece of paper, towel.",44
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:05:21,"and then i 'm going to use just a ladle, of course, you can make your pancakes as big or small as you want if you do n't want, if you do n't have a label, you could just put this in a large measuring cup and then just pour it.",45
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:05:38.630000,so i 'm just going to.,46

pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:05:51.760000,you can see this batter is really nice and thick from the buttermilk.,49
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:05:55.680000,and i think depending on the buttermilk you buy summer thicker.,50
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:06:00.860000,now the one i bought was really quite thick.,51
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:06:03.220000,so then that 's going to affect the consistency of the batter.,52
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:06:12.160000,"so i 'm just so we could now if you have a non stick surface use a spatula, not of stainless steel.",53
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:06:20.980000,she do n't scratch your surface.,54
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:06:22.640000,"so you cook these until the tops you get lots of bubbles and when some of the bubble start, bursting then you 'll know.",55
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:06:31.150000,"you could also just take your spatula and kind of just take a peek underneath 'cause you want the bottom to be golden brown, and this will take maybe depending on your heat to three minutes.",56
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:06:46.360000,so you can see the top.,57
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:06:48.140000,they 're starting to form some bubbles.,58
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:06:51.160000,"some of them are even popping so what you do is, i always like to just put my spatula and just check.",59
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:06:56.550000,and i can see that the bottom is golden brown.,60
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:06:59.260000,so just take your in just flip of course.,61
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:03.300000,"the more you cook the Z browner, and some people like there 's quite light.",62
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:10.890000,"i kind of, like the more the golden brown rolls and crisper and then just flip them and just cook the other side usually, uh, the second side does n't take as long.",63
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:23.390000,plus you will notice at the bottom side.,64
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:26.340000,does n't seem to brown quite as much as the top.,65
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:28.750000,and that 's normal OK.,66
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:32.320000,so pancake down as you can see the second site.,67
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:35,"you kind of, it 's not a solid brown, it 's kind of patchy.",68
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:39,"that 's how you want it, and i have the platter here.",69
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:42.220000,"now , i know the tendency is to kind of stack them.",70
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:45.890000,"but the problem with, that is, if you do that is, the bottom ones tend to get soggy.",71
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:49.700000,so we do n't want that.,72
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:50.740000,so try to have a platter or plate.,73
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:52.900000,"and then you can just space some flat like this, now if you were n't going to serve these immediately.",74
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:07:59.960000,you could put them in a hundred and seventy five degree fahrenheit oven that 's foot eighty degrees.,75
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:08:05.550000,"celsius and just put them right on top of your wire rack, and they can stay there fifteen twenty minutes, and so, uh, if i wanted to another batch, i would spray again.",76
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:08:19.550000,and then just give your better a stir now.,77
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:08:33.700000,"there 's two ways of say, you did n't want to make all of the pancakes, you could just store this batter, just cover it and store it in the fridge for usually like twenty four hours, and then just give it a real good stir, of course it 's not going to be quite as good.",78
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:08:51,but it 's still pretty good.,79
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,0:08:52.140000,or you could just bake off all your pancakes and then just cool.,80

pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:02:20.340000,"now to get a nice tender pancake we just want to mix the ingredients together just until everything 's moistened, you do n't want to get too much gluten developed.",10
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:02:33.100000,"so you do n't want to be really vigorously stirring this you can see, this is easy to make.",11
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:02:46.800000,now if you wanted to the night before you could get all the dry ingredients put together in one bowl and just cover that with plastic crap and then you could even put all the wet ingredients together and cover and put that in the fridge and then just mix it together.,12
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:03:01.170000,now we just want to stir this until moistened.,13
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:03:03.950000,"now do n't worry if there 's some lumps that 's OK, OK.",14
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:03:15.840000,"so that 's our batter now, i 'm going to use here an electric griddle if you have one of these set it at three hundred and fifty degrees fahrenheit that 's a hundred and eighty degrees, celsius, if you do n't have, one of these, you can just use a frying pan on the stove and set your heat to medium, medium high heat and try to use a frying pan that is pretty heavy duty that has a flat bottom.",15
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:03:41.970000,"because you do n't want warps and then you 'll have uneven cooking up the pancakes and then, you know, your pan is ready stove if you take a little drop of water and just put it on it would kind of spider, then, you know, your pans ready, and you may have to adjust the heat as you 're cooking your pancakes.",16
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:04:00.410000,"if they doing too fast or not brown enough, you can just put your heat up or down.",17
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:04:04.570000,"now i 'm just going to use a nonstick cooking, spray that kind of keeps you 're worried about your fat that would just keep it down.",18
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:04:16.710000,"you could also just rub the your pan with either with a brush or with a piece of paper, towel oil or melted butter.",19
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:04:25.360000,so i 'm going to use a ladle to make my pancakes.,20
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:04:31.390000,and you could also put your batter in a large measuring cup and then just poured on whichever way you want.,21
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:04:39.170000,"and of course, you can make your pancakes as big or small as you want just make sure that you space some a little bit apart.",22
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:04:47.670000,"because as you know, the batter will spread a bit, just keep that in mind.",23
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:04:54.100000,so let 's make both that large.,24
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:05:03.130000,i 'll just do a couple.,25
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:05:05.680000,"of course, i could probably do more on this pan.",26
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:05:08.640000,"but and, then.",27
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:05:11.840000,"because if you 're using a nonstick surface, make sure you use something that you do n't want to use a stainless steel that will scratch your surface and then when do to flip them as you can see the pancake will start to get lots of bubbles and craters and when the surface is pretty well covered with the bubbles and some of them are starting to burst then, you know, it 's time to flip, and you can also just take your spatula and kind of put under, and just check to make the underside is you want a nice and golden brown that takes maybe two three minutes depending on your heat, which as i said, you can adjust, if you 're finding, it 's not browning enough OK and you can see there 's lots of bubbles on the top surface and some of them have popped.",28
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:06:05.940000,so i 'm going to flip this and then just did n't see nice golden brown as you can see you can adjust the color by how soon you flip it and then just cook it on the other side.,29
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:06:27.530000,"now the, the second side will not brown as much as the first side.",30
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:06:33.320000,so just keep that in mind.,31
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:06:38.140000,let 's take one two minutes more you want to make sure they 're cooked all the way through OK you can say the second side is not quite as brown.,32
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:06:51.800000,"now when your pancake when you take them off the heat, there is a tendency 'cause it looks cool to stack them all up one on top of the other.",33
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:06:59.970000,but do n't do that.,34
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:07:00.800000,because what happens is the bottom ones get all soggy.,35
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:07:03.650000,"so try to have a plate or platter like this, and just do it this way now, if you were n't serving, these right away.",36
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:07:14.380000,"so your families still in bed you could just turn your oven to one hundred and seventy, five degrees fahrenheit, that 's about eighty degrees celsius and just put these pancakes directly on the wire rack and that you can keep them there for about fifteen twenty minutes.",37
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:07:28.520000,"so now if i was when you make more pancakes what i would do is again spray or put a little more oil or butter and just make another batch the same ways first, and you could just serve these with butter and maple, syrup, or some people like jam, or just some powdered sugar, sprinkled over top and if you have leftovers after you could just freeze them and then you can either re reheat them in the oven, or just put him in your toaster frozen.",38
pancake,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjjLIgdnB1Y,0:08:11.610000,and they 're really pretty good.,39

pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:05:05.080000,"but you want to make sure that you not blowing it to your table, then it causes problems, and i 'm just going to roll it to an even thickness, and, you know, the thickness is can vary if you like a lot of dough, you can roll your 's a little thicker.",56
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:05:29.580000,i would say probably roll it to about an eighth of an inch so.,57
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:05:33.820000,it 's kind of hard to measure.,58
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:05:36.720000,you just keep lifting it and make sure it 's not sticking so you roll your dough out till it 's nice and thin.,59
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:05:41.940000,"and then you grab your paroki tool from quick cut in the mohawk, and you cut out your circles plant, you 're cutter quick twist and a little flick helps to separate it and pick up your scraps as these can be used to make more pure O.",60

pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:06:23.080000,so each disk gets a scoop of the filling and then it 's time for a little bit of finesse.,64
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:06:29.060000,"so , take put a little flower on your fingertips.",65

pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:07:07.380000,so you can actually stretch the dough over a little bit.,74
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:07:10.060000,"so that, that way you do n't have the filling in the way so, i 'm OK.",75
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:07:14.060000,now so you do n't want to fish shaped eroge.,76
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:07:15.900000,so now you can kind of pump it up and then squeeze it up.,77
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:07:22.120000,"so that you can kind of shape it a little more, after you 're done, you might try another one.",78

pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:07:31.480000,"if you 're so, those little sticky, you can actually slide the bottom line a little flower too, and it 'll help and you might have your own method mine works for me.",81
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:07:39.630000,"but you know, whatever works.",82
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:07:40.780000,"but basically you want to seal the top person you can actually stretch this toll free taxi, and then, then do the size and anyway it helps keep your shape.",83
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:07:49.680000,"also , that 's it and the reason, again that you do n't want the filling is stuck in between cell open up in the water and you have a big mess.",84
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlGFRoMj4uE,0:08:04,"so , after all said and done.",85

pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91z7e22XGy8,0:00:34.520000,"it 's kind of a cross between like cream cheese and ricotta cheese, but very delicious stuff once the potatoes are cooked, you have to drain them extremely.",7
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91z7e22XGy8,0:00:42.350000,"well , you do n't want water in this, and then we 're going to match those, while they 're hot and they really should cool down to just warm, before we had the rest of the ingredients.",8
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91z7e22XGy8,0:00:50.780000,"so , smash him and let him sit there for about ten minutes to cool down while you 're waiting you can season them with some salt.",9
pierogi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91z7e22XGy8,0:00:56.320000,"some pepper some, that 's right, cayenne little bit can i highly doubt it so ten or fifteen minutes later the potatoes should be just warm.",10

eggs benedict,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcDejZ2stbw,0:01:15.170000,so it 's going to make it easier for me to stir it up really well.,13
eggs benedict,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcDejZ2stbw,0:01:18.570000,"so once the water in the yolks are incorporated kind of over a medium heat we 're just going to cook these over some simmering water for maybe five minutes or so, until they start to thicken up a little bit OK.",14
eggs benedict,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcDejZ2stbw,0:01:37.460000,"and you can kind of see when i scrape the sides that leaves a trail like the wisc, is able to kind of cut through the foamy stuff.",15

eggs benedict,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcDejZ2stbw,0:02:00.710000,so this is where the whisking is super important.,20
eggs benedict,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcDejZ2stbw,0:02:04.280000,whisk it constantly and just kind of trickled butter in there little by little basically what we 're making is in emotion sauce.,21

eggs benedict,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcDejZ2stbw,0:02:29.080000,now when you start adding the butter is when you get really start to kind of thinking and that 's that multiplication process happening where you 're getting the egg in the butter.,24
eggs benedict,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcDejZ2stbw,0:02:40.190000,"so that they make an acquaintance and they form droplets within droplets and decide to be good friends , right.",25

eggs benedict,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcDejZ2stbw,0:04:04.850000,then you probably do n't need to add any salt and a little bit more lemon just 'cause that 's the way I like it.,44
eggs benedict,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcDejZ2stbw,0:04:16.800000,"but that 's pretty adjustable to your taste, OK, this is gorgeous.",45

minestrone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCTdsgv1wZ4,0:00:30.310000,what we 're going to do is we 're going to add some low sodium low fat chicken broth to the pan like this.,5
minestrone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCTdsgv1wZ4,0:00:40.960000,we 've got about a quart in here and the thing that you really want to look at is when you 're looking at the nutrient information or the back of the container.,6

spaghetti and meatballs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKjmdrMA2t8,0:02:46.100000,"it 's going to take like half the time, the baking or frying would and as soon as they are browned you 're done now.",26

buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:00:21.490000,i 'm going to show you one of the things that 's really close to me.,1
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:00:24.170000,"and , that is buffalo chicken wings because i am from buffalo.",2
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:00:28.170000,"so i 'm going to show you that buffalo chicken wings are really easy to make at home, and you do n't need to spend the money going out and buying them for the game day to start.",3
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:00:37.440000,i have a large dutch oven here filled with about four inches.,4
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:00:42.510000,"so , that is like a safflower oil or canola oil.",5
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:00:45.030000,"any vegetable oil something that can go up to a high, high heat into the spot i 'm going to add a wire rack.",6
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:00:51.110000,now this is one of my favorite tricks.,7
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:00:52.690000,"here , whenever i 'm deep frying, pudding a rack in the bottom of the pot.",8
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:00:56.330000,"what that does, is it helps to fry things?",9
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:00:59.690000,nice and evenly just using tongs to help yourself out there.,10
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:03.530000,"so what that wire rack does, is it helps to lift the food off the bottom of the pan.",11
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:07.790000,so you get really nicely evenly cooked food without any brown thoughts from hitting the bottom.,12
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:14.130000,i 'm going to use a deep fat thermometer here.,13
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:16.550000,this is a candy thermometer and i need to keep the oil up to about four hundred degrees.,14
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:21.690000,and now while this oil comes up to heat i 'm going to show you how to cut the wings into the appropriate size pieces.,15
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:28.400000,this is what you 're going to get your supermarket.,16
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:30.170000,this is a chicken wing here.,17
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:31.470000,and i 'm going to separate it into three parts.,18
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:34.110000,the first part here is the drum at an all you have to do is.,19
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:38.470000,look for the joint of the chicken wing cut through the skin.,20
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:42.200000,bend it a little bit.,21
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:44.130000,pop out the joint should pop out right there.,22
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:46.210000,"and now, you know, where to cut, so this is the drum at.",23
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:49.810000,"and , so this portion believe it.",24
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:51.610000,or not is called the wing.,25
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:53.090000,at you want to do the same thing here where you take the wing tip which is this portion.,26
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:01:57.660000,"you break the joint and then you should be able to cut cleanly through we 're not going to fry up this wingtip here place this in a resealable plastic bag in your freezer, and you 'll have this for whenever you need to make chicken stock.",27
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:02:10.370000,and here you go your wing at.,28
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:02:12.030000,so oil is almost up to temperature the wings take a piece of paper towel here and gently dab off any excess moisture.,29
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:02:20.730000,because if you have excess moisture on your chicken wings once you place them in the hot oil they 're really going to spatter up.,30
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:02:26.450000,"so dry them off really, well, you do n't want your wings to be too cold either.",31
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:02:30.770000,"so , do n't take these right out of the refrigerator and plunge them into the oil?",32
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:02:35.370000,otherwise it will lower the temperature of the oil dramatically and your wings will take that much longer to cook so the chicken wings are nice and dry.,33
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:02:43.110000,now you want to work in batches.,34
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:02:44.490000,you do n't want to throw wings in at once because it will lower the temperature of the oil and a grease will absorb into the chicken wings.,35
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:02:51.660000,and that 's not something you want.,36
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:02:52.910000,so gently place the wings into the pot and the track is really great.,37
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:02:57.440000,because the wings do sink down to the bottom.,38
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:02:59.950000,they 're not going to rest on the bottom of the pot.,39
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:03:02.230000,they 're going to be elevated up.,40
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:03:03.960000,and i 'm using about four pounds of chicken wings total try to fry your drumettes in one batch and your wingettes.,41
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:03:15.190000,"but in general, the wings will cook about twenty minutes in total.",42
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:03:19.240000,"so i 'm on my last batch of wings here, and you want to make sure that when you pull the wings out of the oil you transfer them onto a wire rack.",43
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:03:27.250000,"them , onto paper towel.",44
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:03:28.310000,"because what that does, is that direct contact with paper towel it creates scheme and one side of your wing will get soggy.",45
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:03:34.770000,"so use a wire rack to drain them off and to cool them slightly now, well, i 'm working on my last batch here.",46
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:03:41.360000,i 'm going to start this sauce and the sauces than those important thing for your wings.,47
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:03:45.810000,"all it really is, is two ingredients.",48
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:03:48.020000,"so i have red sauce here that is the real secret, ingredient.",49
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:03:52.690000,so i have one cup going to place it into the bottom of a small saucepan here.,50
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:03:57.650000,and i 'm going to bring this up to heat just to a bare simmer.,51
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:00.710000,"it 's just up to a bear summer, you can see some bubbles forming.",52
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:04.140000,and now i 'm going to add the butter.,53
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:06,so i have one cup of hot sauce.,54
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:08.030000,and i 'm going to add four tablespoons of cold unsalted butter and gradually added in whisking until it combines.,55
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:16.810000,"if you wanted a more mild wing, all you have to do is the butter, a little bit.",56
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:21.690000,"so doing a two to one ratio hot sauce, two butter, will give you a mild wing?",57
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:27.390000,this is about a four to one ratio the butter is nicely incorporated into the hot sauce.,58
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:32.810000,i 'm going to turn the heat off and let this cool down slightly before addressing the wings.,59
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:38.200000,this batch is finally done spent about twenty minutes right onto the wire rack to drain.,60
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:44.780000,so now the chicken wings are going to go right into a bowl here.,61
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:48.890000,use the bold.,62
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:49.630000,that 's why did n't that you can actually toss the wings going to do about half of the batch.,63
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:04:55.030000,here i 'll add about half of the sauce around the side of the bowl just swirled the wings around.,64
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:05:01.560000,"if you 're feeling a little daring here, you can gently toss the wings coat them evenly.",65
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:05:07.850000,so are buffalo wings.,66
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:05:09.010000,"would n't be complete without a little bit of blue cheese dip and not basically is simao, a little bit of sour cream?",67
buffalo wings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,0:05:16.080000,"some blue cheese, of course a little bit of lemon and salt and pepper.",68

sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:00:09.790000,i 'm going to cut the end off the cabbage you can leave in as much of the core as you want.,1
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:00:17.920000,i generally find that it 's a little harder an not so pleasant.,2
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:00:22.460000,so i will cut out most of it.,3
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:00:25.560000,this is generally the simplest way and i will be fermenting this in a crock that i bought at ace hardware.,4
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:00:35.880000,it was about twenty dollars for this crock.,5
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:00:38.340000,"it 's a one gallon sized crock, and i bought a new crop because they say that it 's very easy to leach lead out of the old crocks.",6
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:00:49.580000,"if they have any kind of cracked at all in there, finish, and.",7
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:00:55.620000,"so i thought it was worth it to buy a new crop, just for this purpose.",8
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:00:59.820000,"but without having the spring like a hundred dollars for one of the fancy, fermenting crops this works just as well with the trick.",9
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:01:06.920000,i will show you at the end for keeping the sauerkraut submerged nicely prefer mentink.,10
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:01:15.800000,"i cut my cabbage pretty thin, because you do n't really want huge chunks of sauerkraut.",11
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:01:23.850000,"you want to be able to get just, just as much sauerkraut as you want, and not huge strings.",12
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:01:29.770000,"so once i finish slicing it fairly, finley.",13
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:01:34.650000,i 'll turn it like this and cut across about three times.,14
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:01:38.790000,"so all those shreds of cabbage are, reasonable length and then just drop the right in the crock here when you 're fermenting the cabbage.",15
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:02:03.010000,you really want it to be completely submerged in water because the good bacteria are anaerobic.,16
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:02:13.550000,they grow without the presence of oxygen and the bad bacteria that might take over.,17
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:02:18.350000,"if you 're not careful, require the presence of oxygen.",18
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:02:35.650000,you want to leave it for at least a week.,19
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:02:37.840000,usually i leave it for somewhere between two or three weeks whenever i think.,20
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:02:42.600000,"oh , hey, i had sauerkraut, fermenting around here somewhere.",21
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:02:46.200000,"i wonder if it 's ready, yet so there 's the cabbage.",22
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:02:55.920000,"this is big enough that i can do two heads of cabbage, if i want.",23
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:02:59.400000,"but then it 's very full at the beginning before it, it is compressed down so it 's simpler to deal with.",24
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:03:10.710000,"if i just do one head of the time for one head of cabbage, i 'm going to put in a tablespoon of salt.",25
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:03:16.690000,this is my usual pink himalayan sea salt full of lots of good minerals.,26
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:03:21.370000,i just sprinkle that over the cabbage and you can let it sit for a few minutes.,27
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:03:32.100000,i will go ahead and start working the salt into it now.,28
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:03:36.690000,this works better on a lower surface.,29
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:03:39.890000,because i 'm short and it helps to get your body weight down into it.,30
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:03:43.870000,"but you just start tossing it to get the salt evenly distributed, and then start squeezing and pressing on the cabbage, and in just a few minutes, the cabbage will start releasing liquid and you will your cabbage will take up a lot less space and the liquid usually for me will almost cover the cabbage.",31
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:04:11.530000,i always have to add a little bit of filtered water so that it 's completely submerged and this process will take a few minutes and is slightly energetic.,32
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:04:26.300000,requires a little bit of muscle.,33
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:04:35.950000,after a couple minutes of working and squeezing this.,34
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:04:38.930000,it 's compressed down packed pretty tightly there in the bottom of the pot.,35
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:04:43.860000,it 's a lot moister than it was when i started.,36
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:04:47.170000,"normally , i can tell it 's done when the liquid is just coming up almost to the surface of the cabbage when i press on it like this, and i press it down very firmly.",37
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:04:58.470000,you want it packed in there very tightly.,38
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:05:01.270000,"the next step, this cabbage is not releasing quite as much water.",39
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:05:05.930000,"but , that is perfectly fine.",40
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:05:07.590000,"i 'll just add a little more filtered water so it, it submerged, and once it is packed in there tightly, i will add my water.",41
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:05:20.840000,and then i will show you my trick for keeping it submerged.,42
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:05:23.480000,but i learned from my father.,43
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:05:34.860000,"i add water probably till it 's just about an inch or two above the surface of the cabbage, you have a little bit floating at this point.",44
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:05:43.920000,"it 's kind of hard to show you what the angle of the camera there that there is what it looks like when it 's tilted, and i will go get a gallon size.",45
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:05:59.630000,zip lock bag.,46
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:06:02.570000,and then i 'm going to fill this part way with water.,47
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:06:04.950000,this is not going to come in contact with the sauerkraut.,48
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:06:07.150000,so i 'm just using normal tap water here.,49
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:06:15.430000,and i put probably two quarts or so of water in the bag.,50
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:06:20.960000,"usually , maybe a little less it just needs to be enough to make a good seal on the sauerkraut and then in order to seal it tightly i close the zip on most of the bag and then tilt it.",51
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:06:42.040000,so the water is there.,52
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:06:46.440000,"and then there 's just a small portion here where i 'm letting the air out to get his title steel as possible, mostly that just makes it easier to work with it.",53
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:06:54.170000,"does n't have to have no air left in it, it 's just easier if it 's mostly water and then i just drop this down on top of the cabbage, and you 'll see a little bit of water come up around the edges of the bag.",54
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:07:08.520000,"but the cabbage will stay neatly submerged under the bag, and of course, the bag formed fits to the edges of the container.",55
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:07:14.570000,so it makes a really good seal on their keeping all of the air out.,56
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:07:18.580000,"so the bad bacteria, ca n't work.",57
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:07:21.260000,"i 'll usually throw just a dish towel on top of this, especially if i 'm letting it sit in some other rooms in the kitchen to keep the dust and whatever out of it and then like i said just let it sit for two to three weeks, or you can even let it sit for several months, usually, after two or three weeks, i 'll take it out and put it in mason jars in refrigerator.",58
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:07:40.170000,but obviously this is a technique that was used for a long time for preserving the sauerkraut without refrigeration.,59
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:07:46.930000,so it 's perfectly fine.,60
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:07:48.430000,let it sit this way for months and just continue to sour.,61
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,0:07:51.990000,and that 's homemade sauerkraut.,62
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:00:05.650000,"one of the things i learned from one of my favorite aunts, and virginia is how to make sauerkraut.",0
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:00:11.030000,she makes the best and it 's so easy to make and with so few ingredients.,1
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:00:15.880000,"some sugar vinegar water salt, and of course, cabbage and what you want to start out with or some nice cabbage heads about this size and all i 'm doing is i 'm sharing are chopping the cabbage up to really sort of slow like consistency.",2
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:00:33.370000,"pack it in jars like this, so i 'm taking these quart jars.",3
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:00:38.080000,"and i 'm just putting the cabbage in there, you know, we grow a lot of cabbage here at the farm.",4
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:00:42.280000,it 's a beautiful cool weather season plant.,5
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:00:44.820000,we grow different varieties.,6
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:00:46.680000,"because they come off at different times in the cabbage, heads are of different sizes.",7
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:00:51.210000,but when i like to grow for ornamental purposes is red cabbage now.,8
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:00:56.160000,what i 'm doing here is i 'm packing the cabbage down in the jars.,9
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:00:59.360000,"you want to pack it in just as much as you can as you can see, i 've got it just about packed in.",10
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:01:13.270000,i think i can add a little more there.,11
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:01:16,what you do n't want is the cabbage to touch the top of a jar lid.,12
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:01:20.570000,so i 'm just getting it down to about that point just about got it all packed down in there.,13
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:01:26.810000,look at that in that beautiful.,14
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:01:28.940000,"OK , so i 've got four quarts already started and what you need to think about here is.",15
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:01:33.670000,"it takes about one head of cabbage to do three quarts, just think about that and what you do now is really.",16
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:01:42.530000,"add three basic ingredients and it 's just one teaspoon per ingredient, so you want one teaspoon of sugar in each one of these.",17
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:01:53.560000,"can you set it right on the top just like that, and then you want one teaspoon of salt?",18
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:02:00.110000,this is canning salt little courser.,19
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,0:02:06.210000,and then one teaspoon of vinegar that puts the sour in sauerkraut that was a little shot there we go alright that vinegar smells good.,20

sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:00:05.990000,"so i 'll show you how quick and easy, it is to make your own homemade sauerkraut.",2
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:00:13.720000,"so , the first thing you 'll need to do for making your sauerkraut is get out everything that you need.",3
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:00:19.800000,and first you 'll need your cabbage so that i 'm using a green cabbage today.,4
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:00:24.520000,and then we have caraway seeds.,5
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:00:26.860000,"there 's sort of they look and smell, kind of like human seeds, and then.",6
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:00:30.960000,"sea , salt and then a quart size mason jar with a lid and this one.",7
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:00:38.650000,"i actually have leftover, brine from my last batch, which you can reuse, and it 's actually helpful to reuse your leftover liquid from your last batch.",8
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:00:49.430000,"because there 's already, that, that lactobacillus bacteria in there, and.",9
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:00:53.410000,so it helps the fermentation process.,10
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:00:55.990000,go a little bit faster in your next batch because it 's already cultivated.,11
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:01:00.600000,"and then, the other thing you 'll need is a bowl to put this in, you want, like a good wide bull.",12
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:01:07.130000,because you 're going to have both your hands in there.,13
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:01:10.710000,so you want to have a lot of space to move around the only other thing.,14
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:01:13.980000,"you 'll need is a little like piece of tape or some kind of label to use to label the lid, and will put the date that you started your batch on the lid.",15
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:01:24,so that you can keep track of how long it 's been sitting out or how old.,16
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:01:27.710000,it is after you put it in the fridge.,17
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:01:30.420000,so we 'll start off by taking a little piece of cabbage off of the top because will be using it later when we get everything in our jar.,18
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:01:39.840000,so i 'm just gonna it does n't matter.,19
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:01:41.260000,"it does n't have to be pretty, but you just peel off this top, and you can just put that to the side, OK.",20
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:01:55.920000,and then we basically just want to take the core out of our cabbage and start shredding it up.,21
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:02:01.260000,"and you can either you to use a food processor for this, or you can use your knife to cut this into shreds.",22
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:02:08.090000,and i 've done it both ways.,23
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:02:09.800000,and when i use the food processor i find that it makes a lot smaller pieces.,24
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:02:16.180000,and when i do it with the knife i can control the size of the pieces better.,25
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:02:22.560000,and i can make it.,26
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:02:23.380000,"so that i get, like longer, longer slices, longer shreds of the cabbage and after doing that i find that i like the texture of the longer shreds and.",27
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:02:35.100000,so i 'm going to cut this up with a knife and just cut it into nice thin slices and you can cut up into whatever size pieces you want.,28
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:02:44.040000,but the smaller the better.,29
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:02:45.480000,"because that 's what 's going to give you that sauerkraut texture and it 's going to ferment faster an it 's going to help the process of getting the water, the liquid out of it.",30
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:02:58.140000,"so that you create your brine for the sauerkraut process so, i 'm going to go ahead and cut this up OK.",31
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:03:09.890000,so we have the cabbage all shredded up here into nice thin slices just how i wanted them and you 'll see that this takes up pretty much the whole bowl right now.,32
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:03:22.210000,"but what we 'll do next, is at our caraway seeds an R salt, an will mix that in and then we 'll let it sit for like thirty minutes to an hour and what will happen is that the cabbage will begin to wilt.",33
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:03:35.350000,because both the caraway seeds and the salt help to draw out the moisture from the cabbage and then at that point we 'll start to massage it.,34
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:03:44.820000,"and that will bring out more of the juice, more, the moisture.",35
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:03:48.080000,and then we will have our brine.,36
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:03:51.870000,are fermentation process.,37
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:03:54.040000,"so we 'll just do a tablespoon of the caraway seeds and then i have two tablespoons of sea salt ground up and then just lightly incorporating that trying to sort of spread it throughout all of the cabbage, and it 's fine if it does n't reach all of it just to help the wilting process?",38
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:04:25.690000,"we want it to come in contact with as much of the cabbage is possible, and like i said, the bigger the bowl better, she 'll have more room to play with here and you could even divide this up between two different bowls.",39
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:04:42.260000,"if you want it alright, so we have let our cabbage sit with the salt and caraway seeds for about an hour now, and you can see it 's.",40
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:04:55.570000,that 's gone down about a third.,41
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:04:57.470000,so we 're just going to start massage ing it now.,42
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:05:00.190000,so getting your hands right in there and just basically squeezing cabbage and what we 're trying to do here is work out.,43
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:05:09.750000,"some of that liquid some of the juice from the cabbage and will cabbage a little more, and this is going to get a lot smaller and.",44
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:05:20.860000,"so much moisture will come out that will actually be able to put this in our corn size jar, and it will be covered in its own liquid or its own brine.",45
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:05:34.280000,"so i 've been massage, ing this for just a few minutes, and you can see there 's a good amount of liquid that 's come out already just from a few minutes of massage ing after we let it will put the salt and caraway seeds.",46
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:05:49.200000,"so this is about halfway there you can see the cabbage is really getting will tee it, almost kinda looks mushy and.",47
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:05:57.750000,so we just want to massage this a little bit more alright.,48
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:06:02.630000,so i 've got the cabbage all massage and there 's quite a bit of liquid in here might be able to see that and definitely is covering the top of the cabbage.,49
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:06:13.470000,"so i 'm going to transfer it to my mason jar which already has some of that leftover, brine in it i 'm going to start by just spooning in some cabbage with a big spoon, and if you got a particularly large cabbage, you may need to use another small jar, which is totally fine it does n't really matter how many jars it takes OK.",50
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:06:36.600000,so i have my cabbage and brine packed in here do you want to you can use your hand.,51
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:06:44.450000,or you can be like a pounder and just try and pack it all down to the bottom so that the water rises up and covers the top.,52
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:06:52.570000,and then from here you want to get that cabbage leaf that you took off in the beginning before your shredded your cabbage.,53
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:06:58.470000,"you just wanna get a piece or two big enough to cover the top of your cabbage inside your jar, and then this actually stays down there, really good on its own.",54
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:07:16.380000,this is basically to keep any college from rising to the top and being exposed to the air 'cause that can allow it to grow mold and you do n't really want to do that.,55
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:07:26.410000,"you want to keep it submerged, underneath the brine, and.",56
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:07:30.240000,so this is actually staying down just fine on its own.,57
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:07:33.700000,"but you can also use something of way like you can put like large stones on top of the cabbage leaf, or i 've even used the shot glass before that.",58
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:07:44.310000,"i use for like my wheat grass, and i just stick the shot loss in there, and then screw the cap on an it, it gives enough pressure that it keeps the cabbage leaf down there.",59
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:08:00.740000,and then we 'll just screw the lid on.,60
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:08:04.250000,"you want to have a good, you know, inch, or.",61
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:08:06.910000,so at the top left of space for the air to be.,62
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:08:12.830000,because air will be coming up from the bottom as it ferments and.,63
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:08:16,so you want some place for that to go.,64
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:08:17.750000,so you do n't have an exploding glass jar and.,65
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:08:21.350000,"so the last thing that you want to do is label the top of the jar with some kind of label or tape with the date that you started this batch that you actually screw the top on, and set it on the counter.",66
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:08:35.780000,so we have our cabbage packed in here and are cabbage leaf on top and our weight on top on our lid on tight with the date marked on there.,67
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:08:47.240000,"and now we just want to sit it out on the counter for three to four days, and that 's why we label it with the dates that we can reference that to see when it 's time to take it off of the counter and put it into the fridge.",68
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:09:01.230000,"so , after three or four days sticking it into the fridge and then you can just leave it there indefinitely.",69
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:09:05.920000,and this stuff will last pretty much forever.,70
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:09:08.240000,"because the process of fermentation is actually a preservative method and that was one of the main reasons is used in, in cultures, originally was to preserve vegetables.",71
sauerkraut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,0:09:24.840000,so i hope you enjoy this video.,72

colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwtkHIturro,0:01:38.270000,so that 's a cooked in drain cabbage.,17

colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwtkHIturro,0:02:46.730000,so really what we 're looking for here is a kind of nice fluffy mashed potato with a subtle flavor of onion just coming through from the cabbage and what i find.,29
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwtkHIturro,0:03:01.790000,if you 're making this in any quantity at all what i would do is put into an electric mixer with the paddle.,30
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwtkHIturro,0:03:10.340000,"attachment , but the paddle attachment gonna rain slowly just pour your milk in so what we 're looking for here is a second a nice fluffy texture.",31
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwtkHIturro,0:03:31.420000,"what we do n't want is a wet potato purity, so, i think we 're almost there now with this.",32
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwtkHIturro,0:03:37.740000,so i 'm just going to tip it into serving bowl so the potato needs to be nice.,33

colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwtkHIturro,0:04:11.530000,so there we have a hot steaming bowl of cocaine.,36
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwtkHIturro,0:04:14.770000,and so it 's much potential.,37

colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9GsyAcKk_c,0:00:04.450000,chris ketki shows us how to make a traditional irish side dish cole.,2
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9GsyAcKk_c,0:00:09.870000,cannon is an irish side dish that 's inexpensive to prepare because it brings together cabbage and potatoes to start it off.,3
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9GsyAcKk_c,0:00:18.420000,we cut up the cabbage by cutting through the core of the cabbage in half and then cut it into quarters like.,4
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9GsyAcKk_c,0:00:28.710000,"so all we have to do is remove the tough core and then dice up the cabbage, make a couple of cuts, turn it ninety degrees, and then a couple more cuts, and it 's ready to cook, we 're going to take the cabbage and put it into a pot along with some diced up peeled russet potatoes, cover it with water.",5
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9GsyAcKk_c,0:00:55.790000,bring it up to a boil and cook it until are nice and tender when the potatoes and cabbage are done.,6
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9GsyAcKk_c,0:01:03.040000,"and then in the same pot melt some butter toss in some diced onions when the onions are good and software going to put some warm milk into the pot along with some green onions and then in goes that cabbage and potatoes that we cooked earlier and all we have to do at this point is just like you 're making mashed potatoes were going to smash this up and that cabbage and potatoes will soften into a puree at that point colcannon is ready to serve with your favorite meat or poultry ooh, that looks good to you can look for that recipe.",7
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9GsyAcKk_c,0:01:43.630000,"i news net five or see the live well network on our digital subchannel, five point two for more and chris ketki.",8
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:00:12.120000,i discovered this a few years ago.,0
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:00:13.880000,this is called cannon.,1
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:00:15.340000,"and it 's a way to make sure that potatoes are about his elevated as you could make him super, super easy, this is a really old irish recipe for my pants are hot and is this cocaine and is what it means is white headed cabbage in irish gaelic or one of 'em and it 's traditionally served on salad, and i hope i 'm pronouncing that right it 's the day after halloween if i 'm not somebody told me.",2
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:00:43.130000,"but it 's really easy let me show you, how you do it.",3
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:00:45.980000,"now back here i 've got about two, two and a half pounds of irish potatoes, and i 'm just sending them off over here i 've got about half a pound bacon, an out of the pan that i did the bacon in i break out all of the grease about two cups of shredded cabbage that 's gonna go right in, here and i do n't want to stir fry or saute it actually want to fairly steam it my time is about to go off.",4
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:01:16.420000,"so i 'm getting a little bit of water this is it 's going to get all the little balcony stuff off the bottom without the grease, and i do n't want to let it go.",5
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:01:26.350000,so long that it gets soggy i just want to get a little bit tender.,6
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:01:30.270000,"so i 'm going to cover this up back here just to get hot cover cream this is not, no, you know, we, you know, we like our own prison and we 've got a cup of better.",7
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:01:45.370000,"now in ireland and this is what the best thing when they service they serve it family style, and they put in the middle and they put a hole in the center of the potatoes and they filled out with melted butter and the whole deal is that you 're supposed to take a fork for the potatoes and dip it in melted butter yeah, that 's a good start OK.",8
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:02:06.190000,"now my potatoes are almost done i got my cabbage sitting here going to steam for probably five or six minutes potatoes are done, and i 'm letting the cream in the butter get warm and kind of, come together i 'm going to drain the saaf and come right back and i 'll show you how super easy this is how i really, really did all right SU steam valve on potatoes and then when i put them back into the warm hot, put it back into the hot pot.",9
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:02:31.400000,"because it helps dry them off i threw in the cream and the butter that i have melted back here i have the cabbage right here that i 've given just a few minutes you still want some texture and some crunch to it when i crunch, bite, i guess.",10
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:02:45.670000,"so that coming right over here into the pot now, i would like to do the green onions that go in here these are tiny they got very mild flavor.",11
colcannon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,0:02:57.220000,"so i do n't like to cook him if you want to, if you want to software flavor, go ahead and throw them in the pot with the cabbage for the last couple minutes, and then right in there, and if you add the cream of the butter and it 's a little too dry say about some of the potato cooking water and use that.",12
