hey welcome to the kitchen at cosmos.
today , chef alfredo is going to be making a couple of our famous wood fire brick oven pizzas going to start off with a margarita pizza and after that we 're going to make a quattro, formaggio, or four cheese.
OK , well, to make the margarita pizza we 're going to start off with by stretching the dough and we do make gardell everyday fresh in our kitchen after that we 're going to add some shredded mozzarella cheese.
then our version of a margarita pizza has four dollops of tomato sauce, along with some fresh, chopped tomato, then it goes into the wood burning oven, they certainly, we 've been cooking with for fifteen years.
now it burns it about seven or eight hundred degrees for the pizza cooks very quickly.
the end result is when you cook at that high of a temperature that you wanted with their very crisp crust.
after the margarita pizza comes out of the oven, we finish it with some fresh, grated parmesan cheese.
some fresh basil and around the edge of the pizza on the crust.
we put extra virgin, olive oil and that is, cosmos famous margarita pizza.
OK , now we 're going to make our quattro, formaggio pizza which means four cheeses.
this is a white pizza meaning no sauce, the four cheeses that go on to this pizza, or mozzarella, fontina cheese which is a slightly nutty flavor, crumbled gorgonzola cheese.
gorgonzola is an italian, mild blue cheese.
and then some fresh diced tomato alright, the quadro for logic pizzas, finished we 're going to put it on the plates going to top it with shape parmesan cheese in some extra virgin, olive oil.
and there you have it is n't a quattro for maggio pizza.
