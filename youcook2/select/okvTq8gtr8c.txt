and we 're going to combine it with two tablespoons of our catalina, dressing there.
we go we 're going to put in two tablespoon or two teaspoons of our chili sauce.
then we 'll put in our tablespoon of soy sauce.
then we 'll go ahead and mix the salt thoroughly sort of make a nice even paste.

i 'm going to go ahead and stayed up or remaining dressing here.
i 'll put in our garlic there.

alright , without further ado, i 'm going to go ahead and take a nice bite of this there, it is, yeah, i guess i should always offer you guys the first byte there.
you go that taste good alright.
let me try your wow naturally.
i get the first hit of ginger and garlic, which is really, really satisfying to me always be careful with ginger men at some powerful stuff.
they should regulate that love ginger, but you get attached to that peanut butter.
there 's a vague, vague hint of the catalina, i would be happy with little bit more catalina.
but you can taste it does alter the flavor, and i think i would prefer a little bit more chili sauce because i like the heat.
but , you know, i 'm cooking for my kids here so they have to.
they do n't really enjoy the heat as much as i do.
and this is perfect size two.
