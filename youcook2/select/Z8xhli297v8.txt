OK guys, so today we 're doing another recipe from our eat, well, lose weight.
i guess series and this is what i 'm making today.
they have sections in this book, well, they have all sections in the public domain cores or sides and all that stuff.
then after that, they have like a section where it breaks down kind of different types of food or different regions of the asian section, indian section italian sausage, and it gives you a couple of recipes.
so i picked the asian section because i really love asian food.
i love tofu.
now we 're going to be making tofu and veggie pot stickers with a dipping sauce.
i believe how many is it three pot stickers and one tablespoon of sauce is a hundred and thirty two calories.
so this is a very, very, very good dinner to eat this is not gonna give you a lot of calories and i actually went online, to better homes and garden to actually look up the recipe, when i could n't find the book, the pot stickers themselves are actually only eight calories per serving those extra calories you get comes from the dipping sauce.
so if you did n't want to use those, the dipping sauce and save on calories, you can actually do that, which will drastically change the calorie count for this.
but let 's get into the ingredients first you have some tofu and this calls for half of an eight ounce package of tofu or roughly nine ounces my grocery store only carries one brand of tofu an one size which is the fourteen ounce size.
so all you really need is nine ounces.
so if you have a fourteen ounce size, just a little bit more than half of that package.
now i like to get the extra firm kind.
because the texture of it if you do n't care, or of your grocery store has a bunch of different types of tofu get whatever one you prefer.
but i'ma texture person, i like the texture of the extra firm also, you need to join this a good way to drain it if you do n't well, after you drain just a plain water out of the container on you need to drain it.
so it 's still not as moist if you have a tofu press that 's perfect if not take, your tofu and i should 've video this black forgot take you tofu and put it on some paper towel and then stack heavy things on top of it i put a pot and a couple of bowls on it and put some more paper towel on top and let it sit for about ten to fifteen minutes and see all that moisture.
let me see if i can bring it out all of that got squeezed out of the tofu.
let me have two tablespoons of green onion about two small green onions chopped up one, one third cup of shredded carrot.
one third cup of broccoli slaw anna.
good thing, if you guys are shopping in advanced by the fresh broccoli saw an thrown into the freezer.
because that 's what i did, you can do that with the broccoli slaw.
because all that is broccoli carrots and cabbage all that stuff is easy to freeze you supposed to have one tablespoon of plum sauce i had plum sauce that expired a year ago and i did n't realize it.
so here gives you a breakdown of the equivalent of it, note says three tablespoons, three tablespoons of egg whites approximately is one large egg, and i just need one egg white.
so i 'm going to put two tablespoons.
because i 'm, i 'm assuming when they say the large egg there, including the yolk in it as well.
so i 'm going to put two tablespoons for one egg, white OK guys, there 's one other thing.
i forgot to tell you about this recipe.
i do n't like it so i did n't include it, if you like water chestnuts, the recipe does call for two tablespoons of chopped drained water chestnuts.
but i do n't like them so i did n't put them in.
so now we 're going to combine are egg whites.
our green onion are duck sauce.
our broccoli slaw an one and a half teaspoons of water.
now before i add my total win, i 'm going to give this a quick nick just.
so that everything is coded.
add george tofu in alright guys.
so now you have to move really quickly with this.
you , wanna add about a teaspoon of filling into the center of you.
rappers , moisten, the edges with a little bit of water do n't use eggwash 'cause you do n't want to add any additional calories.
then quickly pick it up and pinch it together diagonally.
now be gentle.
so you do n't rip them because i ripped my very first one.
i make sure you 're getting the air bubbles out of it and just make sure it 's sealed.
you may have to go over it one or two times with your fingers to make sure that you have all the air out.
and , that is sealed then on a flower sheet.
just push it down an press.
it down just.
so that it has a small flat bottom if you press it down too hard, it opens up just pinch it.
but you do wanna press it down gently.
so that the bottom is flat.
so i 'm going to finish these up.
and i 'll be back, so here all the pot stickers put on a tray.
this is such a time consuming process.
so first thing you want to do is to heat two teaspoons of vegetable oil or medium high heat at the bottom of your skillet, and just add half of your pot stickers in your skill at a time.
jess ann cook them for about one minute just until they are lightly browned and do n't let them touch.
that 's why you only add in half of them and if you have press them down a little bit on your baking tray to make the bottoms of them flat.
they 'll stand up in the pan really easy.
now , once they brown a little bit go ahead an ad half a cup of water reduce your heat cover.
this and cook it for about five minutes.
i 'm going to show you guys the bottom of one season, eisenbrandt woman, can you see it?
that 's nice and brown.
all right, after five minutes go ahead on an remove, the cover an let this cup about three or four minutes or until all the water has evaporated.
now after the water evaporates, if your bottoms had not ground in the beginning you would want to let them cook for one or two minutes without anything in it.
so they can brown.
but since minded brown, once this water evaporates, i 'm just going to remove it.
so let him cook for about three or four minutes.
until all the water is gone, alright guys, so all my water is evaporated.
and i 'm going to pick one up.
so you can see the bottom.
that 's the bottom.
and i 'm going to go down and remove these and put them on a cooling rack.
is the maps?
i 'll be done after their all, i 'll be back after they are all done.
so we 're going to be making the dipping sauce for our wontons.
i 've added two tablespoons of water in here.
so two tablespoons of rice vinegar three tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce, and you do need to use the low sodium.
because you want to count your calories as well as your salt intake, you do n't want this to salted and one teaspoon are freshly grated ginger now.
the one thing i do with my gender i get mine from the farmers market and get a big piece, and i just immediately throw it into the freezer, you can always peel it, and then throw it into the freezer.
but the skin on ginger is.
so incredibly thin.
really does n't matter by.
just took mine off just now really easy with a paring knife, and this is still frozen.
so one teaspoon fresh ginger, and one fourth of a teaspoon of toasted so familial, mine is just plain sesame E oil.
again guys, i do n't really think you can substitute any of this stuff because it 's not going to have the same flavor.
one eighth to one fourth of a teaspoon of crushed red pepper, depending on how spicy you like it, you can always add more.
now give this a good whiskey, so, that is combining all the flavors are melting, and give it a taste too.
because you can see if you need to add more oil to thicken it up, or if you want to even add more seasonings.
maybe you think, is a little bland, but i 'm going to let 's get up and give it a tank.
this sauce tastes really, really good guys.
you do n't need to add anything else to this, if you like ginger, or you could always add a little bit more ginger.
but it really does n't need it this is a really good dipping.
soften , it complements the pot stickers very, very well, because of pot.
stickers are not overly season and they 're also tofu.
so this takes really good.
so i 'll be back with pictures.
and i 'll show you my meal.
