hi , i 'm rockin robin from cooking mexican, recipes dot com and today.
i 'm going to be making some authentic carne, asada street tacos.
now , this recipe was sent to me by a reader to my website name bruce harder, bruce originally is from southern california, and he moved to washington state and he could n't find any really good mexican food.
so he wanted to create his own, and that 's what he did here with this recipe, and i 'm going to share that with you today.
also , i 'd like to invite you to go to my website and read his version of it, and i 'll leave a link below for you to find that.
so the first thing we want to do is go over our marinade and all of our ingredients.
so what we have here is we 're going to be using a pound and a half of skirt steak now, bruce says that this is the best kind of meat to use you can use flank steak.
but this one has a little bit more marbling the script stick has more marbling for more flavor and it 's a little bit more tender.
now we 're also going to need a couple two cups of orange juice i 've got some freshly squeezed lime juice and right here.
i 've got some cumin seed and some minced garlic, and some chopped up fresh salon.
TRO and some salt and pepper.
OK , so what we 're going to do is we 're going to mix our marinade together in a bowl first.
so we get all the ingredients combined sewer.
the orange juice in first.
and we want to have enough marinate obviously to cover our meat that 's our lime juice.
are cumin seed and our fresh garlic?
and you can always vary the amount of this if you want.
if you do n't like too much cilantro to put last or, if you love it put a lot and then our, our salt and pepper.
so we 're going to combine this, and then we 're going to put everything including the meat into a zip lock bag.
so now we 're going to put everything in our zip lock bag and hopefully i wo n't spill it alright.
so i 'll put the meeting first, be brave, and poured in OK here.
we go OK.
so we want to make sure that, that marinade is covering the meat now before we, before we seal it up.
we want to get as much of the air out of it as we can.
all right, so we 're going to kind of just wish it around a little bit.
and then we 're going to put this in the refrigerator for at least four hours.
and bruce is put it in, for as long as two days, so the longer it stays the more, it 's going to really tenderize that meat.
my meat spin marinating in the refrigerator now for a good four hours and remember.
it 's always better if you could go over night that would be optimal.
and , well, well, that was marinating.
i went ahead.
an i chopped up.
this is a half of a white onion fineline instant.
i 've got some chopped cilantro, which i 'm going to.
just pour in and just kind of mixed together now what we 're going to do next is.
what 's next is we 're going to take this out.
we 're going to barbeque are meat and then bring it in.
we 're going to chop it up, and then we 're ready to put it together and serve it all right.
i 've got my barbecue heating up here on medium high heat, and i 'm going to go ahead and put the meat on the grill.
this is going to be a little messy.
but wow the meats already really, really softened up, take me a couple minutes here to get this on.
and it 's not going to take very long to cook because this meat is quite thin, we 're going to sear it up.
why can smell it?
i can smell the citrus.
i think my stomach is rumbling now.
you want to make sure you throw out your marinade after you 're done.
you do n't want to keep that, let me go ahead and close the lid check.
this , in just a couple of minutes, it 's not going to take very long at all.
so we have a look at this.
we do n't want to overcook it.
look at that nice grill marks.
this , after we cut this up.
we 're probably going to pete it again, at least that 's what bruce tells me.
you 're going to eat it up a little bit more in the microwave 'cause it 's going to cool off as we cut it up, smells incredible, nice and tender, OK another minute on that side will take it off, alright.
so now i think we 're ready to take the meat off.
and it looks pretty good.
nice grill marks, movies over to the side because they were done first now.
this one here is still just a little bit more rare than the others, but will probably be heating it up a little bit in the, in the microwave.
so we 're going to take those off.
take him in, and then cut it up and serving alright, so now we 're ready to cut up our meat into thumbnail size.
pieces so it makes trips like this, you can see it 's still a little bit rare.
but it 's going to go into the microwave that will cook it up a little bit more only.
because by the time i get done, cutting all this up, it 's, it 's going to cool off and we, we ca n't have cold food that 's gotta be hot to be good place it all back into the dish here, 'cause i cut it up.
and we 'll just continue cutting our pieces up.
so i 've got my meat.
all chopped up in little pieces here and the next thing we 're going to do is heat up our corn tortillas.
now bruce likes to make them authentic with white corn.
so that 's what we have here and what i 'm going to do today is put them in my tortilla oven and put them in the microwave for about a minute.
and then they will stay piping hot.
and then we 're going to eat up our meet again to make sure it 's piping hot.
and then i 'll put it up.
so , we 've got our tortillas hot.
i 've used my tortilla oven and you can see.
i do n't know if you can see this team is just pouring out of this thing, and i reheated them eat a little bit.
so that it is nice and hot.
and tortillas down.
i 'm going to make two here, put him together.
that , so they will come apart.
so what we do.
now is add some of our nice hot minnesota just like that.
make two here all the smells are incredible guys.
this is really, really smelling.
and then all we do is top it off with our onions and cilantro look at that beautiful now, so here you have authentic carne, asada street tacos.
