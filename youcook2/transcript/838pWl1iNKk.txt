so today i 'll be showing you a really great alternative to rama, noodle much healthier alternative twenty three simple ingredient.
so now the three ingredients one are the noodles no, he 's really consist of salt, wheat and water very simple nothing else no, preservatives.
so it 's getting really sweet degree, is number two and they know that filtered water there are nice, filter.
so improved by and lastly number three is, seed was just consist of olive oil sea salt and seaweed mixed together that 's all the three ingredients he.
let 's get on to the making process.
so the first thing you want to do is set to heat i 'm pretty high mix you put, a punch and you fill it with one.
now for this since it 's not a super lee go ahead just a little bit about halfway and then you 're going to bring that to a boil alright.
now that it 's boiling going to put the noodles in now, they come in a pack like this.
so you just take that out and dump them in like that and you can add another one, and how much make usually one is good.
but sometimes you need to.
so you want to make it last longer or cook for more people.
now the beauty with these noodles is you do n't have to wait long time to cook basically just put it in a pot and it cooks about in a minute, or two minutes at most as you see it 's already started.
now basically use a spoon or whatever utensil you have such as a fork in this case, then just swirling around.
so just like that, you know, we see i did n't add any soup base any spices, just noodles with water that are boiled no periodically, just swarming around you can use a time or approximately kind of fuel this week 's longest each noodle is about, you know, flexible and not stiff, then it 's pretty much done.
so right now it 's still working.
so you have to cook it a little longer, then after that, we can deliver a little bit hard to keep mixing it you just kind of help the process 'cause, if you overcook, these are going to be all mushy and disgusting.
so you can overdo it that 's kind of why you want to do it quickly and the reason why i 'm making sudokus you can make this really quick, as you see boiling water, takes about five to four minutes this, is about ten minutes i had?
six porter in base, so maybe around six to five minutes total cooking this whole thing to get a nice warm meal so that 's about it.
now you just turn it down the yourself and there.
you go next.
you just going to straight it so we need a strainer.
so you just going to strain the noodles jordan water out and noodles in that 's it.
the bank toll give it a shake, and there you go do next, next.
just put the noodles inside a ball like such, and you 're almost done now for this final parts.
we 're going to gather seaweed and dump it in.
how about that much then next just makes it the mixing is a little difficult as it might fall out so, but, you know, do your best?
get a good mix in ann, you 're pretty much done.
do you mix it well, and it served so it 's simple as that enjoy my friends, now keep in mind?
this is not a health food.
that being said it does n't mean, you know, unhealthy or anything it just means.
it 's a lot, a lot better.
what 's usually finding a common store like, you know, soup, if you read all the ingredient labels, that means man.
it 's like everything from preservatives chemicals.
i mean, everything that should n't be in their bodies almost there granite it 's much cheaper, i mean, this is not expensive what i bought was the pack is about five dollars for five.
so that 's a dollar per noodle.
the seaweed packets two for three so, i mean, those they last a lot usually just one packet last for about two of these.
so you get a really good deal, divide that up, you know, it 's almost like fifty cents maybe less pursuit since a dollar fifty, an water, i mean, water i do n't know it 's really shit you have a filter it 's free, i should pay for the filter.
so considered at yourself, but, yeah, you can consider for about a dollar fifty.
maybe a dollar less almost the same price, but, except here you got a lot better stuff.
mean seaweed, it 's really good, i mean, wheat typically, i do n't eat it that much.
but sometimes, and it 's better, it 's not sweet too.
but as corn syrup everything else under the sun well, it 's literally.
it 's delicious, mean, you do n't eat it every day but target time specially.
if you do n't have time or you just want something really quick and warm, you do n't want to waste a lot of time so perfect.
neil so just enjoy it.
i 'll see you guys next time.
nice very good.
give it a try yourself and see how you like it.
