you 're going to love our indian vegetable videon E packed full of exotic spices, give it a try while you watch like stars on earth.
so i do n't know about you, but i 'm so excited for tonight 's dinner.
i love you.
indian food, and i think a lot of people do n't think that it 's iaccessible.
but we 're going to make it accessible.
so many spices.
and so many ingredients, so many spices juliana came up with a great idea for how to make the spices easier.
you want to talk about the spice mix is what we 've done.
is we created a concept where we just make spice mixtures beforehand?
according to when the spices go into the dish everything that we needed it all is together in one bowl if you want to know more about what spices were using today quick right here learn lots about the health benefits and special little tips and tricks for indian spices.
we 're going to do a vegetable videon E.
usually , the vegetables are inside the rice, but since we like so many vegetables, we 're doing ours on the side alright.
so the first thing we 're going to do is saute these onions, which i actually started already because you want them to be nice and ground to beginning.
and then we 're going to add some.
garlic , and also some ginger.
these both gave the vegetables are really nice.
fresh tastes that looks delicious alright once.
these are all mixed together, then we will add our spice mixture.
the spice mixture goes into the beginning so it really gets everything, flavored really nicely.
what we have for the rice here.
is a combination of some currents?
some almond, slivers, and then a bunch of the different spices.
garam , masala, some human cinnamon, do you know, why be diani is called videon E, and it 's derived from the persian word, which means fried or toasted.
so in america when we make rice, usually, we just sort of boil.
it , and then eat it.
but we take the spices and we 've to stir.
fry them first and adding to the rice, after which is going to add an extra dimension of flu.
so we 're going to staff all of these, simply, be.
so delicious cited.
and then everyone i think is going to really enjoy our movie tonight.
is movie called todd adesa mean pod, a natasha, and i adore this movie so good, it 's really good?
it 's like a bollywood kind of film is not as long as usual, bollywood films.
sort of like i like to say the garden state of bollywood films that 's what we have here is actually nice.
i like that.
nice references hot in here already so i 'm gonna grab my fan.
so we 've toasted aph, all of the spices here.
i added a bit of extra oil to were being fancy today.
so now over here with this onion mixture that we have that has all the spices in it we 're going to add our first ingredient which are what day, does whatever already cooked them star cook them meaning.
i cooked them before i cook them discuss.
potatoes take so long par cooked in america wow technical chef term yes it is pulled out my chef.
so we 're going to miss this, altogether once potatoes are cooked.
down a bit will add the rest of the ingredients and we 're actually going to transfer it into this.
well , should we try the rice good apparently?
put it put in like a bucketload of spices and things.
really makes it go well, we use brown rice here, too, you can use white rice if you live.
we are now going to add everything into this large pot.
so the way that we 're going to saute these vegetables is by adding them in, in the order of how long they take strategic.
we 're going to add the carrots give it a good stir around, then will add our colleague flow.
it 's like an avalanche of problem, lower, and we 're just going to put the lid on.
i 'm going to add a little bit more oil.
an letting, go sweet, alright, so we 're going to give this about five minutes, will come right back?
we will add the string beans and we will take these two things together OK.
this has cooked down quite a lot, you 'll know it 's about ready when potatoes almost start breaking down.
we really wanted to create that indian texture, which is sort of more mushy less firm babe babymoon.
so we 're going to add the green beans in since everything else, is.
so texturally similar?
i 'm actually just barely, barely going to cook the green beans 'cause everything so hot.
they 're going to continue to cook even when they 're off the flame are ready to taste our vegetable concoction.
i 'm really excited.
we can try all together, can make you like, oh, my goodness.
