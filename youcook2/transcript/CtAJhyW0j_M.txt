you want in your soup, you need soup stock beef or chicken flavor whatever flavor you.
like OK, it 's a powder reform.
add flavor to the soup, and of course, you need to be dried seaweed OK, this one is a korean seaweed delete that and a pot of water.
so we 're going to keep up the water, first will take about five minutes ten minutes.
and we 're going to do is we 're going to add the stock.
soup , soup stock, into about a teaspoon or half a tablespoon, indypendent, how strong flavored you want, can miss valley add a teaspoon of that in there, and then what you want to do is add the dried seaweed.
right about handful, right, CV.
then , at the egg.
then , the last step of course to add the need noodle.
you want to keep the noodle in there for only a maybe maximum three minutes, OK, you do n't want to keep it too long or else the noodle will be very i guess soften you do n't want that you want it as firm and hard as possible.
so about two or three minutes, heating after when it 's boil is good.
let 's get started off.
show you how to do it, OK the first step is to turn up the heat too high and leave there for about five minutes, OK.
and then we 're going to add.
soup stocks about the table, i mean, about a teaspoon word OK, while the water is heating up i 'm going to add the soup stock powder looks something like this.
i show you here.
OK , so add about a teaspoon that certainly spirit when i start to boil the soup stock powder will dissolve quickly.
next step is to take.

it depends how much you want to eat, but i take about two handful, so there 's one to something there.
i love siri taste really good, now if you have onion, you might want to add that as well.
right onion add more flavor to the soup.
but for some reason i do n't have, have onion in my fridge.
so i can add it.
but i would advise.
you add onion in their cut into quarters so you have one onion, and you cut into four and just dump it in there.
OK , i 'm going to wait till it, following up.
i might add a few more seaweed in love.
i really like siri there.

so in about ten minutes to get a nice suit can i just add we do n't once you think that the egg, which is about three to five minutes is boiled then, i 'm going to add the noodles.
OK , well, i 'm going to do is going to turn down the heat to medium OK.
so razputin, the moodle, moodle.
this me ocean cost more than a buck, right.
but it 's really filling it is much better than the instant noodle.
because you get on and most of the natural material like the seaweed and the egg and of course, it will only go as well, it is more refreshing i know i do n't like to use the word refreshing only in drinks.
but for this type of noodle soup, it is refreshing OK just leave the udo, noodle there for about a minute OK there it is.
i wait about a minute and then it 's ready.
so you can see in less than ten minutes.

now you do n't have to use sudo, noodle you can use me and which is chinese style noodle use that, which means a vietnamese noodle for virtual vermicelli, noodle it 's a once you boil it becomes translucent for this one, as well.
so different type of noodles you can even try spaghetti noodle in there.
but i really do n't recommend it.
but you can try it if you 're desperate for ingredients and you do n't have any other choice.
but again, like i said, all these noodles can be used, including the spaghetti noodles.
but i guess if you want to use it.
