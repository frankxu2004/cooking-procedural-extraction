hi , everyone, and welcome to make out his kitchen today.
we 're going to be making hot dogs.
i love him.
i love eating hot dogs when you 're watching some football or any other sort of sport or if it 's just for a pack lunch or taking him down to the beach there fantastic.
so we 're going to make hot dogs today.
but there 's a bit of a twist.
OK hot dogs.
they are fantastic at anytime anywhere anyplace, then we 're going to make him today, but like i said, there 's a bit of a twist.
we 're going to make stuffed hot dogs in that way gonna stuff sausage with cheese and onion and source.
now usually it all goes over the top and, you know, it falls apart, everywhere.
we 're actually going to put it inside our sausage and then we 're going to wrap our sausage in bacon, OK.
so here 's what you 're going to need get two or like i said, you can get any sort of sausages you want, and as many.
as you want i 'm just going to do.
today , one rasher of bacon cut in half we 're going to use a sharp knife to cut them in half.
you 're going to need some onion.
some chopped onion going to need some salt and pepper.
we 're going to need some a better tennis at the right way.
some tomato ketchup and some dijon mustard, or you can use american mustard if you want to, and this is optional.
i love it.
sauerkraut now all, it is, is cabbage salt and water?
you combine in the can sometimes i make it myself it 's OK, but it 's just as easy to get in, and it 's pretty good.
so get some sauerkraut if you want to, if you do n't want to leave it out.
and we 're also going to use some cheddar cheese.
now what i want you to do with the cheese is cut a slice off, OK just cut it straight down there.
and then cut it in the middle into sticks like that.
so we 're going to stuff our sausage there with some cheese in the middle, and it 's just going to go all gooey and melt all over the cheese.
and it 's going to be wrapped up in the bacon, and of course, OK, some hot dog rolls get the system, you said once.
i think they 're really nice and just cut him in half and later on.
we 'll toast these guys.
OK , i 'll show you how to do it.
alrighty guys first thing.
first , we just want to make our source that we 're going to put in the sausages here.
so we 're going to get some dijon mayonnaise squeezer that not too much.
and april half of tomato catch it will just put it straight in there, does n't pray does n't make a great noise, do n't worry about many folks?
OK , we 're going to mix that up like that, instead of having them separate.
we 're going to have them together schedule a good mix and so great color to that sort of light orangey reddish color.
it 's really not OK, that 's the source now.
we 're going to cut our sausages OK.
get a really sharp knife OK and tip.
first , i 'm just going to make an incision and just cut like that.
wanna go all the way through, i 'm currently just want to go up to a bit there.
just mike, an incision like that, and just pulled apart.
so we 've got something like that kind of the little pocket inside the sausage.
it is going to spoon some of the source in there.
OK , just like that, just be really gentle with them.
we 'll take a bit of care with this OK now.
this might seem a bit of work, and, you know, doing this for a few people, but let me tell you, it is well worth it.
OK , we go to our source.
we want to put it out cheese.
just put it right down the bottom there, there.
you go just like that covered up with a bit of source, OK wipe off my hands and.
now we just want to add little bits of onion in there as well, just put your toothpick straight through there.
that will just hold the bacon in.
i ca n't hear you get your bacon and just lift up his sausage.
just rap it around until you get to the end, and we 'll get another toothpick.
we will put that one in straight through there.
so it holds in that one so that shit sausage there guys wrapped in bacon do it to the other one and then will put him on the grill.
OK guys, that 's what you want to look like alright just wrapped in bacon.
pick him up by the folks just there by the toothpicks.
and that 's where you wanted to look like.
now we 're going to put him on our pretty hot grill with some oil in it.
OK , we 'll get our cast iron griddle pan just here again, that nice and hot.
put some oil in it to some vegetable oil.
i 'm going to put our stuff.
sausages straight on.
there , like that, OK, and we 're going to put out other sausage on there just like that.
i can get the oil to code.
am through now you want to cook these babies for more i do n't know about couple minutes on each side.
or , you know, maybe three minutes on each side you will get obviously some bit of onion that will just fall out.
but most of it will stay in there.
if it comes out, do n't worry about it?
but all that cheese is going to melt when the heat comes through and bacon is going to be crispy.
the sausages are going to be absolutely beautiful packed full of flavor.
hot dogs are cooking nicely.
that 's a nice color, just here.
and the hot dog hears or cooking nicely, quietly capital pieces on the end of falling off.
but i 've just turned these, and they 're going to be done and probably another couple minutes.
and then we 'll put him in our hot dog buns.
now if you want to toast your hot dog buns are with them right now, at this stage if not just leave them.
and then will assemble am pretty soon.
OK , now it 's time to assemble our hot dogs.
alrighty what i want you to do is just pull a hotdog over, and can i just on the bottom line, you can see all their cheeses, or GUI, and melted.
OK , i 'll just pull the toothpicks out.
you bacon will stay right there because it 's now attached to it.
now like i said, you can put a bit of extra source.
and this is optional unfitting some sauerkraut just over the top which is just some cabbage and water and a little bit of vinegar i 'm just going to put that over the top and i think i 've got some of this.
source , leftover, what i 'll do is obvious drizzle.
the gui would that change with young and with the source and the tender made the crispy bacon learn about you.
but life does n't get much better than that.
you take care, and i 'll see you next time bye , bye.
