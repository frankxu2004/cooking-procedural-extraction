today , we 're going to learn how to make tuna fish rules.
these are really popular role in japan.
third , everywhere, my wife, the japan housewife absolutely loves them and she said we gotta swim, and how to make him, and i, gotta be honest, i like him way more than i care to admit.
so we just have some lettuce and some cucumber right there on the regular, i space that we have here if you do n't have to do that, please click on the link in CR there.
video , we show you how to make rice no problem and have some tuna fish that 's mixed up with some mayonnaise, you can do that to your own taste salt and pepper.
i 'm sure most of, you know, how to make tuna fish at home, an really these are super simple.
you just put the ingredients together like so and then roll the rice and the role like sewing and really, there 's not much to these.
but these taste great for fantastic every time we would go out for sushi in japan.
we 'd always be sure to order him.
these things are kind of comparing like the french fries in japan, because there, and i 'm kind of surprised you 're not popular here in the US, either.
but once you get it rolled over you get your super sharp sushi knife, and you just go ahead and cut it, you 'll notice that our knife is pretty long.
so it knock sushi get it quite a bit.
but we 're just cutting these roles like.
so wiping the knife every time, and that rag has a rice vinegar water mixture that keeps the rice from sticking to the knife and hopes.
and i 've cut through it just like butter.
so , yeah, it 's probably more these roles and anything else that i was in japan for a long time, just 'cause they 're good and like i said there everywhere, and everyone loves him and the really simple to make it home , too.
so feeling for something simple and fun to make these are.
certainly , it is wealth.
kids love them too.
and some people are little squeamish about seafood lover as well, so here they are.
i hope you enjoy it as much as we do 'cause these things are awesome so.
thanks , for watching, we appreciate likes and comments.
