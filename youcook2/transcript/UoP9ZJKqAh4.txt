sarah , from average betty here, and i 'm making mashed, potato pops OK.
i know what you 're thinking mashed potatoes on a stick how do you do that the answer is simple.
magic is this your card.
let 's make mashed potato pops.
i 've gotta bowl here, and these are a couple of idaho russets that i 've peeled and cooked in the microwave just until tender.
this is butter and some salt you can cook the potatoes on the stovetop too, just like you would, if you were making mashed potatoes this crazy fun idea was developed by erica of in eric 's kitchen, there that looks about right.
i 'm going to make two different kinds of pops, so i 'm dividing the mashed potatoes lacks so.
hi , this is pepper jack.
cheese bacon boots get this good and combined, and if you have n't guessed yet this is going to be a jalapeno popper pop, i know it 's tempting to go crazy with the cheese and bacon.
but you need a good ratio, so your pop stay together and there.
that 's about the texture, you want for my next trick.
i 'm going ballpark style.
this is garlic powder, dried parsley.
and this is finally grated parmesan cheese now to shape them into balls, daniel popper pop mixture.
i 've got a trustee tablespoon here, and i 'm filling it just to the top.
do n't go crazy with a heaping, tablespoon or your pop will be too big to fit in your pie hole?
remember you should n't have to rely on magic to eat.
the , pops roll the mixture into a ball easy enough right continue doing this until you have all the mixture rolled into balls.
i 'm going to do the same thing with the garlic, parmesan mixture idaho russets are really good for this.
because they have a lower moisture content.
so the mixture sticks together well pulling each ball place them on a baking sheet.
when you fill up a sheet, you can pop them into the fridge for safekeeping and it helps to set them up.
this is where things get exciting.
here 's an egg, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do?
and these are panko bread.
crumbs this is what you call a breading station place.
the mashed potato balls into the beaten egg and get them good encoded transfer the coded mashed potato ball into the breadcrumbs.
now the potato ball not you, and here 's a garlic parmesan ball you can do it continue with this until all of your balls are coded.
now for the really fun and dangerous part where i saw myself in half OK just kidding.
but i 'm sure the haters got excited about that.
this is a giant vat of hot oil people, which can be almost as dangerous as sign yourself in half.
so be careful.
i use a kitchen spider to drop the balls into the hot oil quick factoid.
i 'm terrified of spiders, spiders.
not so much look at this golden brown delicious, nahs, directly on to a paper towel, and just a sprinkle of salt, and here 's my first batch.
if you 're wondering where the magic is pipe down copperfield, we 're about to magically transform our mashed potato balls and a mash potato, pops hocus, pocus, alakazam, turn these balls into pops, and how good does that.
look africa dang, good get the mashed, potato.
