hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with lamb shank, vindaloo that 's right.
i get a lot of complaints how come he never do.
i do n't have a lot of experience with it.
i love to eat it, but i thought i would give this one of my favourites should try this very spicy lamb type curry dish.
so i hope i got it close.
you indian cuisine experts will be the judge.
so here we go alright so step one here.
i 'm going to put four lamb shanks in a plastic bag is need to get marinated overnight before we start the dish going to place those in will bowl.
i 'm gonna pour, some cider vinegar.
some vegetable oil, some salt and then something called tamarind, i 'm using a tamarind concentrate and we 'll talk a little bit about that on the blog.
but it 's a very tart sour kind of citrus like ingredient, already started mixing that up and then i realized i never put the dharmasala in which is a blend of indian spices.
we 've used that before we like it going to mix that in and that 's basically the marinade.
so we 're going to pour that over the lamb shanks were going to seal up that bag really well, just to confuse you.
i put mine in a second bag as i thought i had a leak or going to squeeze out as much air as possible.
so the meat is immersed in the marinade in the fridge overnight.
not a bad idea to turn it over once in awhile alright.
the next day i 'm going to pull it out of the bag.
i 'm going to place it on an oiled foil lined sheet pan, do n't throw away the marinade by the way that 's going in the stu later?
so just reserve the marinade.
i 'm going to salt those generously on both sides and we 're going to brown those in a very hot oven, four fifty for fifteen or twenty minutes until they 're nice and brown were going to pull those out and reserve until needed.
next up in a blender we 're going to add a lot of garlic.
a lot of ginger some cherry tomatoes, a nice big onion and a little bit of water were going to pull sat on, and off until we have a nice smooth puree.
and it kind of looks like a delicious strawberry smoothie, and yet, it.
so the opposite of that.
so just set it aside, and it 's back over to the stove where we 're going to start the actual vindaloo.
so we 're going to put a heavy dutch oven on medium high heat, and i 'm going to put in some clarified butter.
now this is supposed to be something called G, which is basically clarified butter.
but clarified butter will work butter in going to throw roughly chopped onion in there with a big pinch of salt, and we 're going to brown this, and i 'm not talking golden brown.
i 'm talking almost golden black that 's going to add sweetness and a depth of color to the sauce.
so just keep cooking him.
and right there you 're thinking that 's probably good.
it 's not let him go further while those are browning.
i 'm going to get my spice blend together, which is cumyn, cinnamon black pepper cayenne, and a lot of it.
dry mustard, an paprika and all that will be on the blog of course.
we 're going to go back over the stove check the onions and now we 're talking.
that 's what we want nicely browned very dark edges.
and at that point we 're going to back the heat down to medium and dump in the spices.
and we 're going to kind of toast the spices in that hot butter and that really wakes up the flavor in it.
really , really adds an extra dimension, which i guess, would be the fifth dimension.
but who 's keeping tract and that only needs to cook for about two minutes just make a difference right after that we 're going to go ahead and jump in the marinade that was leftover from the bag of lamb.
remember , that was the cider in the tamarind and the oil going to dump that in.
and then we 're going to jump in the mixture from the blender the onion.
the tomato, the ginger the garlic or give that, esther.
we 're going to raise the heat up to high.
we want to bring this up to a simmer and before we put the lamb back in, we 're going to go ahead and add a little bit of brown sugar just to balance out that acidity in heat.
so stir that in.
and then come back in.
and , if using a similar sized pot, you should have enough liquid to just almost come up to the top.
it does n't have to be totally covered.
this is going to do for three hours and we 're going to turn these several times, so as long as you have that much liquid.
if you need to add another splash of water do n't be afraid.
do n't forget, you could always reduce sauces later, so once the lamb goes in?
i want to turn the heat down to low, i want you to cover it tightly.
and i want you to simmer that very slowly on very low heat hours.
not a bad idea to turn it over once in awhile and all you 're trying to do and why there 's no way to screw up the cooking part of this.
you 're just going to simmer it until the meats tender.
see how that four goes right into that meat that 's done right, so like i said, it 's going to take about three hours.
but do n't quote me on it could take two and a half could take four plan accordingly right at that point i 'm gonna go ahead and remove the lamb from the pots you can just cover it with foil while we finish the sauce and finishing this sauce means two things, the old skimin season.
so we 're going to turn the heat up a little bit we want to bring this back to a simmer and we need to skim off all that fat there 's a ton of it just take your ladle and skim all the fat off before you serve it and.
besides defend ifying the top the other thing, you should do is taste for seasoning and we 're going to have to do much adjusting, but, you know, what check just in case, maybe add a little salt and that 's it go ahead and throw your lamb shank on a plate i 'm serving mine.
next to some lentils and rice i 'm going to spoon over that incredible sauce i 'm going to garnish with some whole cilantro leaves, and there you go, authenticity notwithstanding this was a super delicious, incredibly tasty, very spicy exciting dinner totally fork tender should just fall right off the bone and just a very complex flavor sweet sour, aeromatic and that beautiful subtly game elam just the absolute perfect meat for this.
so i really, really hope you give this a try head over to food wishes, dot com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual, and as oeis enjoy.
