alright , i have harvested all my cabbage.
i 'm very excited to make what i call german sauerkraut.
so what i 've done is, i 've peeled off the outer leaves here and wo n't be using those for the sauerkraut.
then i 've got the cabbage heads.
i cut him in half right, i core them take this core out.
then i quarter them.
then what i do course, user rinsed.
i put him over here in the slicer, dicer machine.
let me show you.
what blade i 'm using.
it 's this blade.
here it has actually two different sides on i 'm using the thicker of the two sides just a long blade on it.
that 's a thick side, and that 's the thin side so i could pick your site up.
this is a bosch mixer.
it 's wonderful does great job also has the blender on this side, but anyway.
so i take the cabbage head.
take them at the scripture out.
turn it on.
i need a girls room smaller cabbages.
so , then our process, the whole head like that, i 'll take this out.
and it 's going to dump it into this four gallon bucket.
any bucket size will work.
and then i have, a course are himalayan crystal salt and i 'm going to sprinkle that in here i 'm not measuring anything.
i was using the spoon as a device to spread it out and then just come in here.
and i 'm just kind of turning it around to the salt, gets on everything and what 's going to happen is the salt draws the water out of the cabbage and will make a puddle.
here , you can see actually i do n't know if you can actually see the water collecting here.
but there 's some of the water right there, and it 's been going up quite a bit, since i 've been doing this.
so i just kind of mash it up here.
mix it up when i have all the cabbage mixed in here.
with the salt water you do n't have any other spices in here, then i 'll get a plate and i put the plate on top of here, if there is n't enough water to cover the cabbage, i 'll add some more water to it.
i put the plate in and then i 'll put a weight on top of the plate, and that will keep everything.
submerged underneath, the water, but i just leave it on the counter for two weeks.
i 'll come back in two weeks.
i 'll taste it if it tastes right to maine, then i 'll will dump the, the saltwater out.
rinse it off, and we have awesome tasting.
my wife will cook up some sourdough bread and will have that for just snacking on during the day, or for dinner.
the difference between german sauerkraut an american sauerkraut, is that german sauerkraut is fermented and american?
sauerkraut is made with.
vinegar , which is very bitter.
i do n't like the american sauerkraut at all.
i spent a lot of time in germany, and i like the mild flavor of the german sauerkraut.
so you can do this with this cabbage, heads that you get from the grocery store.
very easy to do sauerkraut is a great pro, biotic, so, if you want to strengthen your digestive system, have some sauerkraut or make your own sauerkraut.
anyway , it 's going to be a long two weeks so i can eat this.
i love it.
our instant, and then keep it in the refrigerator at a private lasting refrigerator two to three or four weeks that probably wo n't last that long in this household.
because i love eating it.
this is LDS, prepper.
reminding you if you are prepared, you shall not fear, and if you get a couple heads of cabbage, you can make your own sauerkraut with a little bit of time and a little bit of salt.
