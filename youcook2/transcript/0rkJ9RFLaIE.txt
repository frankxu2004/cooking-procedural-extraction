hi , i 'm stephanie manley with copycats dot com.
today , we 're going to revisit the olive gardens.
we just love recipes from the olive garden today.
we 're going to make the pasta visual soup.
so many of you love this recipe.
an we 're going to prepare this recipe for you right now.
we 've got lots of ingredients and the olive garden pasta visual.
we have ground meat that 's not pictured here, but we 're going to go ahead and bring it up.
we have two jars of marinara sauce, just use your favorite kind.
a couple of cans of diced.
tomatoes , we have some low sodium beef broth that 's really good idea to use a low sodium 'cause we do n't want to get into much salt.
then we have chopped onions, chop celery with carrots.
a little bit of tabasco for just a little bit of heat some ground, black pepper, oregano, parsley, finally some dry pasta so use whatever you have on hand.
i 'm using penne pasta right here.
but it really does n't matter what you use.
so let 's go ahead and get started cooking that recipe.
OK , we 're going to begin by sweating the vegetables.
so that means we 're going to just cook up the celery and the onions and everything until the onions are translucent now.
i 'm sweating them in a couple of tablespoons of butter, you can use vegetable oil.
both work equally as well.
this is at a medium to medium high heat.
my onions are almost translucent.
and i 'm going to go ahead and add in my ground meat using a really lean ground meat.
so i 'm not going to drain this.
but if you 're using something that 's fifteen or twenty percent fat in your hamburger meat, you may want to go ahead and rain this again.
this is extremely lean.
so we 're just going to break this up and live brown for a few minutes, and then we 'll add in everything else, do n't be concerned that the meat is n't fully cooked at this point?
this soup is going to cook for an additional forty five minutes, so by the time the soups done the meat will be cooked thoroughly.
OK , we 're going to begin by adding everything else into our pot and again, that 's two jars of marinara sauce.
the marinara size helps flavor the soup itself, so you do n't have to worry about a lot of seasonings, so go ahead.
pick out your favorite kind of marinara sauce.
i always buy extra when it goes on sale, so i have plenty on hand.
we 're going to go ahead and add or canned diced tomatoes.
we 're going to add in.
white , beans were going to add in our red kidney.
it 's looking really good, already we 're going to add inter black pepper.
we 're going to add in oreganos.
we 're going to add in our parsley.
a little bit of tabasco for a little bit of heat.
then , we 're going to add in RB frost again.
i really recommend you using low sodium, you do n't want your soup over salted even before you get the chance to season it yourself.
are right now we 're going to add in our pasta?
if you plan on freezing the soup, you may want to cook your pasta before an.
add it just before serving.
but sometimes freezing pasta makes it soft and mushy.
so just that, if you want to freeze the soup, do n't add your pasta until just before serving?
we 're going to eat all of our soup right away, so we 're going to go ahead and pasta.
and we 're going to let the liquid that 's in soup, cook the boss stuff.
so the suits when cooking for about thirty five to forty five minutes, and, you can see it 's just chock full of beans and meat and tomatoes and carrots it 's going to be.
