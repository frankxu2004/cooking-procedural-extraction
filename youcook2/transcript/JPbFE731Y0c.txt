i 'm doctor barbecue for fire cooker dot com.
this , another recipe i 'm going to do today.
it 's grilled bratwurst with beer, butter and onions and i 've added a little garlic to this one, too.
i doodle different than most folks.
i do n't like the idea of simmer in my brats in beer.
me , you 're making kind of brought worst soup that you 're not going to eat, i like to do a little different.
the way i start out is.
but the butter in the pan on my grill and then i add the onions three big onions for a pan full of bratz, is there going to cook way down, and today.
i made a little bit of garlic to it.
you 're not going to hurt anything probably not mandatory.
but i like doing that.
so i will let these cook for a little while in the butter 'cause they 're going to take a little bit longer than the brought worse.
it 's been about fifteen minutes not third these onions a couple of times they 're getting pretty softened up.
now looking good.
so i 'm going to add this guinness to him.
you can use later if you want.
but the dark beer works out pretty well, it gives a nice this dramatic entrance.
they use what you got laying around, you know, i usually look in the back of the fridge and find it.
i never got around to drink and put that one in there, but the guinness it gives it a nice deep flavor.
it 's a good way to go with the brought worst, so i started back up.
and i 'll put the broadmoor sign.
i 'm put in these brats on i 'm going to cook him.
but i 'm not that worried about getting done inside.
because i 'm going to what i 'm going to do.
i 'm going to brown these brought worst up.
now and then i 'm going to take him and drop him into the bath there with the beer and onions and everything.
it 'll be hot by that.
so as they get colored up and looking good i 'm not that worried about him being completely done on the inside 'cause they 're going to finish cooking in there will be right back.
OK , well, he 's been cooking for awhile.
it 's probably been about ten, fifteen minutes as you can see.
i 've got some of them already, in here in the bath with the onions in the beer that you put him in as they 're ready, you know, they do n't all get done at the same time, these last few will go in.
now they 're looking pretty good and.
again , you do n't have to worry so much about him, getting all done pushing down in if they 're not done quite on the inside.
yet that 's OK, because i 'm going to cook him a little bit more.
i 'm going to cover with foil and close the lid, and then i 'm going to let him cook for about twenty minutes, with the foil on.
and then i 'm going to take the foil off.
'cause i want those onions and beer to reduce down.
so we want to get done.
i 've got the braatz laying in there, which sort of a creamy onion beer mixture will see you in a few minutes.
i 've been cooking for about twenty minutes, with the foil on and then i took the foil off and spent about another fifteen or twenty and you see how they 're all kind of rendered down.
now and the onions are all creamed out those braatz or soaking in that beer and onions and garlic beautiful serve him up really, pretty easy serving just a bun potato chips my white sox comiskey park plate in the honor of baseball, you know, brought worst in baseball kind of goes together.
well , grabs little bitty onions out of japan there cook down pretty hard, but it makes for a nice plate.
if you like put mustard on him.
it 's not really my thing, so i 'm going to mind just like this, this is my beer.
