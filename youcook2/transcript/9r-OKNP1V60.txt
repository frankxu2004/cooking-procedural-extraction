hi guys, today on davison cook, i 'm going to show you how to make one of my favorite kind of mashed potatoes cream cheese, mashed potatoes, oh, my god, they are.
so good, nice and thick, yet fluffy and light.
so let 's get started OK, we 're going to start by washing in scrubbing at potato.
it 's really good.
i get kinda OCD with cleaning potatoes.
it never feel clean to me, you know, i 'm saying.
i hate that feeling next, you 're gonna go ahead and pill them, and i 'm using russet potatoes because rusted.
are the best for mashed potatoes?
OK , forget what to her russets are the bomb.
i potatoes are big green, but that 's OK, they were still good, my book.
next , we 're going to slice our potatoes lengthwise until even size strips OK, not cubes is never going to use nice, even size strips like that get them into a partner back cover them with chicken broth.
instead of salted water going to use chicken broth.
it 's going to add a lot of flavor and it wo n't taste like chicken.
i promise OK do n't forget you guys.
you can find this recipe on my blog theme was n't com what a ton of the recipe.
so going over there and check it out, and here 's the brought that i use you guys, is called better than bouillon?
i love this stuff is like a pace, and then you just add water to it.
OK , we 're going to place, are potatoes on the i bring it to a boil, and they 're going to reduce the heat and simmer them for about thirty minutes until they are super, super, super soft dislike that OK or a knife should glide through like a hot comb through fresh naps, OK it should be.
so soft, and it 's totally OK to overcook these potatoes.
you do n't want to undercut them at all.
go ahead and drain them in a calendar.
and they were going to turn them back to that hot pot and place them right back on the eye and let them steam for a bit to get rid of some of the extra water.
an mashed potatoes are not besties.
honey , they do not get along.
so you do n't want that in your mashed potatoes.
now we 're going to go ahead and mash them up.
once mash, mash so i can even talk mash each potato up once in then stop you, gotta know when to put that measure down.
i know it 's fun, but we want thick mashed potatoes.
not glue we OK and the more you work it the glue ear, it becomes alright, so know when to stop next.
we 're going to add in some chopped up.
but are they have chopped up nice and cute and little so.
they melt really quickly, and you can use a rubber.
spatula kinda, you know, toss it around a bit very gently next.
i 'm going to add in some chopped up cream cheese and throw that in there.
i 'm going to toss this around very gently go ahead and add enough half and half to get the texture that i like.
so go and add your half and half in there and match it up a little bit.
useless bachelor kind of stir it up a little bit.
but not too much kay not too much then you can add in some salt and pepper.
i did n't add in anything.
i thought it was perfectly season.
and here is the texture that i like.
i do n't like mashed potatoes that are like baby food.
i ca n't do that from the south.
we like things thick and chunky like our booties.
this is perfect.
i 'm going to add in a little bit of butter because i already have a muffin top, so why not it 's perfect and there.
we have it nice fluffy, thick mashed potatoes.
stick to your ribs.
type mashed potatoes goes great with some gravy and some bacon cheese.
whatever these are perfect and they are so flavorful.
i hope you guys enjoy this recipe.
thank you so much for watching bye guys.
