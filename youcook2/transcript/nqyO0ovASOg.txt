hi guys, and laura betali, and on this episode of lauren, the kitchen i 'm going to show you how to make potato hash.
now this is not to be mistaken with hash browns because for me, there are two completely different things and in a future episode, i would love to share.
my , my recipe for hash browns.
but for right now, i 'm going to make potato hash and let me take you out the ingredients.
so we can get started.
you 're going to some potatoes peeled, and diced, i 'm using uconn gold and i cut them into about half inch little cubes like that.
you also going to need some chopped up.
red bell pepper onions and fresh parsley often pepper and a little bit of olive oil in a ten C bit of butter now.
like i always said potato hash and hash browns for me or two different things these are like little cubes of potatoes that are mixed with veggies and cooked and crispy and delicious, and then the hash browns or the shredded kind that i really crispy.
but they do n't normally have any veggies in them.
this happens to be my favorite way of eating them.
i do prefer the more ash brown but to be honest.
i like them, both, so today, i 'm doing this kind now in this large skillet.
i have some olive oil in a little bit of butter, and i 'm melting that over medium heat and you could also use any other kind of potatoes.
i prefer the uconn gold.
there 's so buttery.
they got like a sweet buttery rich taste, which i adore they have n't my favorite potato.
but you can use whatever you want obviously.
now once that comes up to temperature.
i 'm going to show you what to do next.
and my potatoes and this like i said, is over medium heat give us a little stir?
now what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to cover them this late.
obviously is n't big enough to fit the pan, but that 's OK, what i want to do is just cover the potatoes.
and i 'm going to let this cook for about ten minutes.
what i 'm trying to do is cook the potatoes halfway like kind of steam them halfway, and then when i add my veggies and my brown them up i 'll make sure that they 're completely cooked through.
so when they develop a good amount of color i 'm not nervous that they 're cooked on the outside.
but now on the inside, so i 'm going to let this go for ten minutes.
and then i 'll show you the next step after ten minutes.
i 'm gonna take off the lid going to turn the heat up to about that medium high, thank you, these studies, so already tell are starting to brown.
that is, what you 're looking for after that.
i 'm going to add in my onion in my pepper, and i 'm going to just see the map with some salt and pepper and.
now the important thing to remember here if not to mix them too much.
because if you overmix them, then you 're not going to perform across on anything.
so what i 'm going to do i 'm here.
this , sir, just to make sure everything is mixed together.
actually , going to switch through this because and make sure everything is nice and flat like.
so , and i 'm going to cook it like that for about five minutes, and i 'm going to give this a POS.
i 'm going to flatten it out again and cook it for another five minutes and look just continue to do that.
and so the regis and potatoes just develop a nice golden brown crispy on the outside quickly color and i 'll show you.
what they look like once a day or.
so just keep, keep your eye on them just making sure that you always keep everything in one layer and leaving it there for a few minutes in order for that cluster.
form my potatoes are pretty much exactly how i want them now, i 'm going to sprinkle in the garlic and now.
i did n't have the garlic when i added the rest of the veggies.
because any problems with garlic for that long it would burn when coral inference becomes very bitter.
i like that sprinkle in some parsley potatoes, took about fifteen minutes to develop the color now, i 'm going to cook them for another minute or two until the garlic becomes fragrant my great, that to me or like the perfect like that one right there, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, there.
so yummy and.
we do n't take very long at all.
but they have definitely that restaurant quality like hash potatoes or whatever you going, you get on a saturday morning, for breakfast somewhere into the bomb could n't WWW dot lerner casino comments recipe.
now , see you next time.
