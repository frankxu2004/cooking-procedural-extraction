this is our cabbage plot, with planted are cabbage from seed last spring.
it is an old irish variety called quarter hark, since october we 've been harvesting cabbage.
it is january now.
and the cabbage kept well, despite frost and rain the outer leaves, start turned brown.
but further in the cabbage is still perfect, and today we are going to make sauerkraut, or in big garbage ryan big cabin in ireland people do n't really our crowd where i grew up we had it for breakfast lunch and dinner.
so literally all the time, and i quite miss it.
sometimes i have a special cabbage grater which my mom gave to me and i can shred the cabbage with ease.
the cabbage head is not very tight.
so i have to keep pushing it together while i great.
it is very sharp.
now i weigh the cabbage.
be cause i want to add the right quantity of salt one to hundred for sour crowd.
so for these one and a half killers, i need fifteen grams sold approximately one tablespoon.
i also add a capsule of lactic acid bacteria.
i could also use buttermilk, which would work just as well to start the fermentation process, then i start massage ing the cabbage with my hands and soon as liquid running off the cabbage, which is good when it looks like this i stop and fill the cabbage into preserving jars.
i make sure to divide the liquid evenly between jars.
then i crashed the cabbage further with a rolling pin.
be cause we do n't eat that much sauerkraut.
we make it in small jars, rather than one of those big sauerkraut, earthen pots.
it 's more practical, i put a clean cabbage leaf on top and push everything down once more.
it is important that the cabbage is completely covered with liquid as the fermentation process is an aerobic, and would be disturbed if air could reach the cabbage that jars remained room temperature for two days.
then we move them into cool room for two weeks, then we have a first look some people wait for six weeks.
but we find that often the crowd is sour enough after two weeks.
this one looks like it 's not gone according to plan.
it looks a bit rotten.
and it smells very foul sometimes this can happen, and we just throw it out this jar looks, and smells good.
you can see how the crowd rose during fermentation in the liquid is at the bottom.
some people try to avoid this by putting a weight like A stone on top of the crowd, OK, so how does it taste mama.
so up so one crunchy, very nice and not one leaf was wasted in the process.
