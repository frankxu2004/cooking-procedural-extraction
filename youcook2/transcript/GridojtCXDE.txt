so to do this.
add some oil in a hot pan.
add some whole garam, masala.
i 've got cinnamon, cardamom, close everything, so, once you saute your whole garam, masala add chigira OK, add some ginger.
garlic paste vegetables for vegetable briani do not cut vegetables into small freezers.
make them little bit bigger pieces so that when you cook it, you want this nice vegetable people to come while you eat the variance.
so i 've got some carrots.
some cauliflower, and i 've got potatoes look at the way i cut these potatoes into nice fix.
OK , so when you actually cook them, you can actually see these vegetables are not matched up.
i 've got some funny also.
but i 'm going to add this little later, when your vegetables are flying in this ginger garlic paste, add solves in this preparation.
we are going to cook the vegetables still there seventy percent done, and then you add rice on top over it.
now if you see this paradox, it is slightly brown, you know, you want your vegetables to be nicely sorted, this saw dying of vegetables give very nice flavor.
i 'm going to add fried onion on top of it later.
i want all the vegetables to have slight ground coating on the vegetables.
and then i 'm going to let them steam and cook, i 'm going to add half of the mint and coriander seed.
this mid gives very nice brianna flavor to that rice dish and then i 'm going to add some green chili.
i 've got some really big pieces.
you want this green chili to be big pieces because you do n't want them to disappear into this preparation every time.
i add chili powder turmeric, and coriander powder cumin portal and my make my own very animus ala.
but today, i 'm going to use the store.
but brianna, masella.
so that you know, a lot of you can use this way just use just one packet of briani, masella, portal OK.
so now if you notice all my spices are quoted very, well on these vegetables.
OK , so, that is, what you want, you want your vegetables to be flavorful in your be.
really you do n't want them just like boiled vegetables.
which do n't test at all so to this, what i 'm going to do.
i 'm going to add half of the yogurt.

i 'm going to add very little yogurt, so at this point of time i 'm going to add some of the funnier i have to be very effective.
choose a bigger pan like the non stick pan, like what i 'm using, and that way.
the water operates parser.
and you get your vegetables very nicely coated with the marcellus whether you take a piece of potato, or you take a piece of cauliflower or carrot or even funny say all of them have a very nice chording of this muscle 's.
and i 'm going to keep it aside.
i have surprise for almost one hour now.
usually if you solve it for thirty minutes, it 's good sign.
also , remember, you know, you should buy basmati rice.
which by itself, smells really nice.
so i 've got here some water.
boiling , i 'm going to add some oil to it.
if you want you can add some grammar.
so i 'm going to add chigira and some class and caramel.
so it 's up to you, if you want to add, you can add i 'm going to add to this preparation.
bring it to one, but remember one thing since i have solved this right, so long.
this rise is going to just cook in less than three four minutes.
vegetables are seventy percent done.
so i 'm going to cook this lights.
also chili seventy percent done prices, almost getting done, so we 're going to drain this rise.
check this, this is, you know, almost seventy percent done, you know, i take some of these with half of these vegetables.
OK , i 'm going to divide into two power portions, and i 'm going to spread the first portion on bottom of this puzzle, and then to this bottom portion, i 'm going to add some more.
and then i 'm going to add some nuts.
some cashing out some allmans.
and then i 'm going to heat it up a little bit and check the seasoning.
if you want to add a little bit more salt, you can add OK, and then sprinkle some of this fried onion.
make sure the flame is very simple.
and then put half of this rice OK excellent and then on the top.
i 'm going to use little bit of these vegetables, little bit leftover vegetables.
OK , look at this all these vegetables have a very nice flavor and they 're going to remain so flavorful.
you add some of these fried onion.
see this fried onion gives very nice sweet flavor to your price.
and then sprinkle the rest of the rice now on top of this.
we 're going to put some more chopped coriander and mint leaves, that is left at the last, what we 'll do.
is we going to sprinkle little bit of saffron color, while i was a kid, you know, my mom always whenever she made honey, you know, she 's glad some fried bread, you know, from the double cummings i kept some of these bread.
so what i 'm going to do, i 'm going to put it on top of this OK.
so after you done adding the color, the bread everything just cover this with a lid OK?
now , i know a lot of you are getting this chicken.
biryani , lambie, reani, without getting bored, but some of you are still unable to figure out.
and you 're thinking maybe, you know, there is something wrong with the recipe.
trust me, african chefs is mellow, have the bottom?
bun , you know, because they 're very careful.
but lot of you if you 're just starting off, you know, it is a problem that you will all face.
so i found one more method how we can avoid that completely so to avoid this farming.
we have something called as hard.
bain marie, that is, what we do to keep food hot and lot of times when we make desserts in bakery.
we use a vein marry so that it does n't born at the bottom main memory.
is nothing but a bigger weather in which there is some water, what you do you take this?
very any container.
and put it on top of that when you put water in the bottom in a bigger vessel and then you put another visual on top.
this is you wash up only that it will not bomb, i have been cooking this vegetable briani in the brain marriage for last thirty minutes.
now the billion is almost done, so, let 's understand this brain marry one more time.
the top bezel is sitting in the bottom level with little water in the bottom result and with the heat from the water like a steam, there is cooking you can do.
another thing is you can put this whole vessel in the album and make a perfect look at this look at this look at this love.
green chili, also is full of a nice flavors now, it will check this video, annie hall.
look at this bottom of this was n't and, then you put in a double been married, you know, the bottom will shine as when you started the cooking process.
so let 's say this, see another thing i cook this bread or top of it and still it is consumed it is a little kids lau, specially, when you add, you know, fried bread to brianna and that gives a very nice sweet flavor even if you look at this monitors they look as if they have been roasted, you know, that 's beautiful.
