hi , anyhow, i have time.
i got a request from elizabeth want to learn how to make chicken pot pie.
so i got some rice noodle.
this is a dry, very hard rice noodle.
and you soak into like a hot water just from that F hot water, not boiling water.
if you soak in the water, water, or the noodle see this, they will stick together and later on is hard to code.
so , you suck in this noodle with warm hot water about i would say fifteen minutes.
it was separated like this and visible one serving at home.
i like to do for one, serving single serving, you just get a nice serving plate and you just put the protein and vegetable and the pasta here so, you know, that 's just for you, yeah, i guess i 'm cook chicken or you can use rosa tori chicken or you can use the grilled chicken that you have leftover and.
i got some shredded cut carrot green onion.
this is the unsalted peanut and i use that food processor does where you get this for garnish for later on.
i guess i 'm beansprout in one egg.
so we 're going to make the sauce first.
i 'm gonna show, you.
how to cook.
now we are going to make this SOS pad thai sauce.
i got three tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and two tablespoons of sugar.
i just put in the microwave for a few seconds, and we stir until the sugar and vinegar dissolve like this.
you give a quick taste this going to be your sweet imbalanced taste.
most people will add three tablespoon sugar and three tablespoon of the apple cider equal amount.
but i just had two tables with assuming so i like this way.
but one teaspoon or the free sauce and that i hot chili sauce maybe one tablespoon, two depend how you like it.
i like to use some hot chili flake and some structure more flavor and this is the one of the important ingredient for popeyes sauce.
tamarine , can you see it right here?
i got from kroger.
they have a little one in kroger, or the halo 's market.
this is a like a fruit taste, like plum very sour, give them a unis, citrus.
so i 'm going to add in some two TSP.
here we go.
and you get them a quick taste.
the sauce supposed to be look like almost like glaze and the sauce is pretty strong flavor.
i like it nice well balance pad thai sauce.
and you have to respect to many different culture in southeast asia, the regions.
everybody cook your own party sauce so we have to respect them, and this is my version of the part.
and there 's like six seven way of the south that part i steichen code.
so i 'm going to introduce to you and now, we 're going to cook, we want to make sure the walk is hot some cooking oil that 's good, we 're going to cooked eight first, scrambled egg and then there going to stir fry vegetable first as some ginger and garlic then the fix stir fry, this is just for one serving for about a minute after one minute going to end a noodle this new do is not well done cook, yet.
so we need some time to cook it through if you cook for like a few people at a time i suggest you can put a part of the body of water and then you can add for the serving of the noodles into the water just voice for maybe one minute, and there was often really quick.
so we want to speed up a little bit come up well maybe fifteen twenty, second and they will help to get the new loose often one quick note, if you cook for lots of people like this walk i can cook for four serving if you cook for eight people i suggest, you use two walk.
because you want to make sure you can maintain the temperature while you cook it is very important.
so you see the new software.
now right, and they still kind of stay dry if you agree, did not dry does mean your walk is not high enough.
because you need to see it does asian cookies or about stir fry is sears.
so this is good.
now we 're going to start the source, you as much, as you want, and depend how you like it.
so i usually just think about cover up like addressing the idea that we need the whole entire sauce and then i can a quick sure i bought it to see i think this is good enough and the leftover sauce you can use it for later so.
now is very critical a lot of people just surf, like this.
so the sauce taste like dressing sweet and sour watering really not really good for flavor yet you want to common lies the source.
because we have sugar in all the marine and all the good stuff.
so what i 'd like to do is, i want to keep steering and make sure my wife is hot if they 're not have he is cara for a few seconds here we go.
you see, the temperature increase, and you almost want to stir the noodle until like they kind of, like a stick together again.
and i can see the chicken in the state had the common ization.
there 's a flavored you just have to try a few times, you know, cook a few times.
you find a good recipe.
you just keep trying until you master the way you like it, oh, yeah, i can just tell by looking probably one more minute there with me.
oh , yeah, i like it right before you serve get them a quick try.
it take it so now.
if you want to have more flavor, you just add a little more salt.
at a time is the same thing as so you do n't burn.
the noodle is fine.
just a little bit, and let it stir frying, karma lies unique.
a camel, azatian, now texture walla.
so we can know, push some beach power right here and some line, some people like to squeeze piece of line and we just going to sprinkle some penis.
this is roasted unsalted net on the top like that, and just going to add some more structure.
let me get my parsley right here, here we go.
i 'm excuse me, cilantro a week elizabeth, does your chicken pot pie.
i hope you like the video.
i 'm chef town.
