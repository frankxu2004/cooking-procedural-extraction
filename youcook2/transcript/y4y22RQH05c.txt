hey guys, thanks stop by ballistic barbeque ann, welcome to the latest installation of my great burger recreation series.
i 've received a bunch of requests or five guys, burger, i agree five guys.
killer burger secret to their success is keeping it simple.
they do n't have a big crazy menu, the ingredients are very, very fresh.
and we 're going to try to do here so without any further ado.
let 's get started first.
i want to cover the topics that i like to choose when i go to five guys.
i personally like to keep my burgers.
they 're kind of simple.
and that 's we 're going to basically make my burger exactly how i order it at five guys, and we 're going to go with catch up mustard mayo.
i 'm going to grill up tomato, some hand.
leaf lettuce and some nice american deli style cheese.
this is not the type that comes wrapped in plastic.
let 's get to making this patties now.
alright so obviously i have two patties of eighty twenty.
some parchment laid out.
what i 'm going to do is place this now five guys.
they were using like three and a half ounces.
i do n't have a scale.
so i do n't know just want to keep me that this is for me.
anyway , i 'm not making any money on these things anyway, they actually stack.
there 's four high and i think that 's just for production reasons right now.
what they use is this big like stainless steel trowel thing to flatten am.
i 'm going to use my old burger smasher from my smash burger video, and i 'm going to smash it, see what happens here.
yep , looks pretty good.
a little bit more alright, let 's get these things out to the grill alright, so let 's get these burgers going here.
and , this is, you know, regular, eighty twenty ground beef.
think five guys, you know, one of their claims is the twice ground beef.
this is just ground.
they do nazis in their patties, they just think they 're just letting me do the talking.
here i 'm going to grill some onions.
and i do n't know whether they put oil or not.
but i 'm not grown, five hundred onions here, so i need a little bit of, you know, help moisture, so there 'll be able to dried out.
bunch these are sesame E seed.
buns , but luckily found these they have a little bit more of an egg year, based then your regular bun they 're not like your typical white bread buns, these, uh, on the package, it was, you know, gourmet restaurant style bonds and these are pretty similar to what five guys uses you there very nice man, you cannot.
ask for better question that movies are done.
all right guys.
let 's, let 's get all this goodness into the house and will make some burgers here.
alright so five guys has a very specific way of dressing the burgers there.
you go with three rings.
will catch up on the bottom.
two rings of mustard on the bottom bun where to go with our grilled onions, you know, top bun mayo lettuce five pickles.
one two free, or and what their thought as they want you to get a bite in every bite of everything and everybody and then two slices of tomato right.
now for the burger cheese got a little bit more melted than there is just.
because while i was sitting there cameras up.
so pretty darn good look at that.
all right now how they wrap this.
i hope i do n't know if the soil is big enough, they just take the corners bring up to the tops.
yes , that 's pretty much how you 're going to get it, but, you know, what we 're going to eat this bad boy stand by this is going to be ugly.
i came prepared with napkins this time.
sting is huge.
big is my head bacteria.
this is no BS and this is every, is every bit as good as the real thing like, i said, the key is using good ingredients and they got some good simple techniques and you can make one of these home no problem, anyway, guys, thanks again.
i 'm getting a lot of requests for some killer burgers.
i 'll be having another one coming up real soon.
