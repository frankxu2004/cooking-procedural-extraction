no recipe required and tonight.
i 've got a, a fried rice dish where now like yesterday, or the day before i clicked off some pork chops.
i got a little bit of leftover pork, so we 're going to make pork fried rice.
it 's really easy to do in a great way to use leftovers, both like meat like the pork.
i 've got if you 've got leftover rice from ordering chinese food and even all the vegetables in your fridge will use obviously what i 've got.
but feel free to substitute.
it 's really about the technique on this one.
let 's go ahead and get started.
let 's go ahead and get started are pork fried rice now, i like start you should start with the, with the vegetables that are going to take the longest, and you also want to make sure that you get everything kind of prepared before you start 'cause everything goes pretty quick.
i got my pan on high heat adam on carrots first.
just kind of coarsely chopped little bit of vegetable pam.
some salt and pepper going to season as we go.
i 'm going to take a quick toss and these are going to take probably three minutes yourself.
just two starts off.
and i do n't like to cook anything supersoft.
but i 've got my pork chopped up ready to go to leftover pork for maine couple pork chops.
i 've got an egg that i added about two tablespoons of water to mixed up thoroughly.
i 've got my rice pre-cooked cooked at this morning.
erase is absolute perfect for this, and then some frozen peas standing by, so i 'm going to come back in about two minutes will add the ingredients.
put everything together OK so before the onion or garlic brown going to give it a little toss i 'm going to add my egg in there.
i 'm going to roll the pan.
i like to use a nonstick pan for this recipe.
roll the pants, or kind of spreads out.
let the i 'd go for a couple, couple seconds really does n't take all that long and then kind of get in their scramble.
it around and it will kind of separate.
fall , apart as we add, our other ingredients, i 'm going to add my peas.
i got like a gay quarter cup of frozen peas going to add are pork.
you really want to get the heat going as much as possible is costs.
all this, together we gotta season, again, as we go a little bit of salts, little bit of fresh ground, black pepper.
then we 'll hit it with just a little bit of soy sauce.
i find the biggest kind of mistake.
i used to make with adding too much soy sauce, another really take a ton.
the flavor, everything.
and i do n't really.
i find it can be overpowering pretty quick and we 're going to add two cups.
maybe three two and a half cups of cooked rice if you ever need to add a touch more oil you can do that.
and then i 'm just going to cook this on high heat.
the oil we added all the other ingredients are just going to kind of break up the rice so it does n't really stick together anymore.
and i 'm going to let this go on high heat for probably five minutes, four minutes.
he really does depend on your heat, so we 're going to come back.
my rice is actually just starting to stick to the bottom, which is for me, you.
wanna give it a little taste.
make sure your season is good.
mine could use just a little bit more salt and pepper give it one more toss.
and we 're good to go.
let 's start this up.
let 's go ahead and serve up this beautiful, colorful, and delicious fried rice you can obviously make this a whole meal in itself or serve it as a side dish.
it 's got plenty of ingredients in there, and this is obviously one of those dishes you can really kind of throw anything at all in there.
you want anything you got in the fridge, and he leftovers and you 're going to absolutely love, it.
i 'll see you next time on no recipe required.
