hi , i 'm holly food editor at my recipes, dot com dinner.
tonight will show you how to make a healthy and delicious supper in less than forty five minutes.
kung pao chicken is one of my favorite, take out dishes.
but with this recipe, i can make it at home in less than thirty minutes for lower calories, fat and sodium with the same authentic flavor.
i 'll start by browning my onions in dark sesame E.
oil next saute garlic for about thirty seconds.
that 's plenty of time for it to release its flavor, add one pound of chopped chicken thighs to the onion mixture and saute for about three minutes, while the chicken browns make the sauce combine water with soy sauce, cornstarch brown sugar ginger, and crushed.
pepper them with these ingredients together until the sugar dissolves add the sauce to the pan and bring it to a boil.
once the sauce comes to a boil at red bell peppers and snow peas cookies for about two minutes, or until they are crisp, tender does n't this dish look better and more fresh than what you find in a restaurant.
finish it off by topping with chopped peanuts.
i hope you enjoy this recipe for your dinner tonight.
