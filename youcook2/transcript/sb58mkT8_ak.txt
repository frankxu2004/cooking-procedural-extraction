cooking with the vegan zombie valentine 's day.
it 's right around the corner.
now i 'm going to be spending valentine 's day with india here.
but for all you lovebirds out that are looking to make something delicious for that special someone we 've got just the recipe for you on tonight 's menu of romance pad thai for two.
so what do you say we get started all in all this recipe, takes about twenty five minutes to a half hour.
the hardest part is waiting for the water to boil.
i already got that started for us.
now we gotta.
do is make the sauce for the pad thai?
come on, to get started going to turn your pan on to a low heat, and about a quarter cup of olive oil.
it 's important to keep this at a low heat.
because we 're going to add some really small pieces of garlic, and you do n't want that garlic to burn.
or you 're going to die while it 's warm enough, we 're going to shred two cloves of garlic.
try not to get your knuckles in there.
we have our olive oil at a really nice temperature now.
i 'm going to go ahead and add all my spices, we got a half a teaspoon of coriander.
we 're going to use a quarter teaspoon of crushed red pepper now, be careful with this.
it 's very hot and i 'm a huge wimp.
so i use a little bit.
but it 's got a great kick to it, if you like a little more heat, go ahead and be brave, and just add a little bit more.
maybe a half teaspoon, maybe a whole teaspoon i do n't know.
are you were also going to add a whole teaspoon onion powder over this up?
try to get those spices to release their flavors into the oil for a little bit, and we 're going to add three tablespoons of sugar.
now just add a half a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar put the garlic right in there will start this for about two minutes, and then we 're going to add some tofu here.
i have are baked tofu that i made in a previous episode, you should check that recipe, all it 's really easy to make you can keep it frozen for three months or you can refrigerate it for a week.
you can even enjoy it fresh out of the oven next.
we 're going to add a cup and a quarter of veggie broth.
we 're going to pour that in turn, the heat up to high just keeps turning it want to bring this to a boil.
let it reduce down.
and thinking up just a little bit.
then we 're going to cook.
are noodles stir it in with the sauce serve it up on a delicious love filled plate so.
hot , well, our sauce is ready.
our waters, boil.
and we 're going to go ahead and add a half a pound of rice noodles.
now , these racing was only take about five minutes to cook.
so we 're going to, we 're going to storm in bring that back up to a boil and let him soften up well.
that 's happening, i shred.
it about a quarter cups, worth of cabbage.
so i 'm going to fill that in with our sauce and a quarter cup of carrots that i shredded stir that in let him soften up it smells good, well, those things are all cooking.
we 're going to make a beautiful little shifu nod of basil that we 're going to stare right in after the dishes finished.
you 're going to take four five basil leaves, stack them on top of each other, like this roll it up.
give it a nice thin, slice look at look, up pretty that looks are noodles are perfectly cooked, and ready to go.
this is about how thick you want your sauce to be.
we 're going to pop him right in from the water.
so the pans dirt right in the final steps were going to stir in a half a teaspoon of salt.
traditionally , pad thai has fish sauce in it.
but , you know, what we 're going to set those little fishies free and we 're going to use our vegan, were sister?
sauce , just a teaspoon of that stir.
it all up we 're going to add some lime juice.
we want to get all those juices flowing, so we 're going to do is just roll it out like that cut in half.
we 're going to use about a tablespoon of lime.
juice stabler couple times with a fork, i have a little stranger here.
but if you do n't have a strainer, just be careful not to get any seeds or anything in there.
squeeze it in stir.
and it 's ready to be plated.
pad top, two and now for the finishing touches.
traditionally , you 're supposed to mix sprouts in.
but i 'd like to just kind of adam on top cause.
