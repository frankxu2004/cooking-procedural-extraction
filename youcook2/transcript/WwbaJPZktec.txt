and for this one, i 'm just it 's got.
this wonderful lemon pepper E coating to it so it 's very flakey is very fine.
so this is just a wonderful, wonderful salmon that you can make hearty lunch or dinner with an for today 's recipe, i 'm going to make a box D pancake.
box T is said to have originate it sometime back in the family, so, let 's go and make a boxy pancake with fergie to my friends.
hot smoked salmon start by grating four peeled potatoes, so using a box grater, just shred the potatoes are like this.
now remember potatoes will yield a little bit of starch.
so to release some of the starch, what you can do is when you have a very large amount of it, you can squeeze any excess storage like that into your bold looks, like that, and then we 're going to talk this, and.
so we 're not a larger bowl over here.
so there 's your prepared potato.
so let 's continue on and do another of these another three and a half of these potatoes.
now i finish reading all of my potatoes have squeezed the starch out and for the shredded potato into this bowl as you can see ready to use.
so put that aside for a moment and we 're going to grab another bowl.
so i 'll just swap these out here OK and into my bowl, i 'm going to add my flower and to this, i 'm going to add my milk was poor listen and then it 's taking a whisk incorporate the two together.
so will whisk the flour in the milk together which is like that OK, we 're going to do this until it becomes fairly thick with a fairly thick consistency would add a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper coming together quite nicely now, the potato that i 've shredded, shredded, about four of them and that 's to make a very large quantity of these boxy pancakes.
but for this amount that i 've just poured out here for the flower in the milk this is just enough for one pancake so.
we 're not going to use all the potato in this one.
i just wanted to show you what it was like to prepare all of potato for later on.
as we make more and more pancakes, OK so that looks right.
into this, we 're going to take going to take about a handful of shredded potato.
OK , let 's throw that in, and just incorporate that around like this that looks good.
you see that so there we go and now our batter is ready to pour in the pack.
so i 've made about a dozen box.
do pancakes put one on a place?
then , let 's take a generous serving of our salmon.
i remember this is going to come a little bit, but that 's fine because this is a hot smoke salmon.
so the texture is it 's kind of flake nicely.
i just have a look at this beautiful, it is gorgeous pinky color will take a wedge of lemon.
and we 're going to squeeze this, a nicely on top of salmon careful to not get your.
i have done that a few times, that is, not pleasant.
