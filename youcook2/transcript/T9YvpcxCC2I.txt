i 'm going to make some pasta today, sounds good to me.
i 'm going to use some ditalini pasta, and we 're going to use quite a bit of olive oil answer tomatoes and some cannellini beans and some white pepper and garlic, an i had pecorino, romano here and a bay leaf.
an i have like two kinds of parsley just a little bit in a little bit of basil out.
this is all out of my garden.
i 'll call it and i do n't have a lot.
let 's get started.
i 'm going to take him.
put some olive oil in my pan here.
maybe a little more a decent amount add my garlic.
this is five cloves of garlic.
now i 'm going to turn the heat on, and i 'll turn it on about medium.
maybe a little below medium rana gently cook this garlic and in the mean time i want to take my two cans of white beans.
well , put him in my strainer and rinse them as well.
the garlic is starting to turn brown.
and we really do n't want it to go any further than that, just brown lightly going to add the can of tomatoes.
adam , bailey and some salt about a half a teaspoon of coarse salt.
turn the heat up a little bit and get this going.
let 's come up to a bubble head up some of the tomatoes.
and i added about a half teaspoon of salt that you saw me do because these tomatoes really do n't have any salt.
they actually have a little bit.
but it 's says on the can fifteen milligrams per serving, where american tomatoes usually have five hundred milligrams or more.
so they 're virtually insulted, i 'm just going to let this gently simmer for about twenty minutes it 's been going for twenty minutes, and i took some of the oil and skimmed some of the foil off top and put it in here 'cause i thought i put just a tad bit, too much i 'm going to add the beans, stir those in an once it comes back up to above, oh, i 'm going to let it bubble for another fifteen minutes just.
so everything can kind of combine and mary flavor i had my pot of water here to boil the pasta, and i 'm going to start it while this gets going.
next you take your pasta that you cooked put it in there in your spice is not your spices.
your herbs, which basil is best.
but i did n't have much.
so i put in some parsley as well and let 's start this up and turn your heat off and we 're ready to plate.
and i also put replating here.
also put about a fourth, a teaspoon of white pepper in this at the last moment forgot to show it to you added the pepper whenever i added the earth, and if you like that just a little bit of your extra special olive oil on top it 's optional.
and of course, you 're i 'm using romano who use parmesan give it a try.
i 'm so hungry really very nice, possible themes something, economical and delicious thanks so much for watching.
