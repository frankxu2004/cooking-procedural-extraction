hey guys, thanks for cooking with tammy, said i 'm going to show you how to make a delicious, southern, baked macaroni and cheese.
i need to warn you guys.
this recipe is not only rich with delicious cheeses, but is rich in flavor as well, which, in my opinion is definitely a good thing.
this video is also part of my holiday series.
so the amount of ingredients used is going to be a little bit more than the usual.
because most of us are going to have people coming over for the holidays.
so with that being said guys.
let 's get started ingredients that we want to need R thirty.
two ounces of elbow macaroni or two sixteen ounce boxes as well as sixteen ounces of sharp cheddar cheese eight ounces of pepper jack cheese, an eight ounces of velveeta cheese, as well as six tablespoons of butter, one teaspoon of seasonal salt to taste one TSP, paprika for a nice smoky , flavour.
one teaspoon of ground, black pepper, as well as one teaspoon of garlic powder and one teaspoon of onion powder, four tablespoons of all purpose flour cups of half and half for the topping.
we 're also going to need an additional eight ounce package of shredded cheese as well as eight ounces of pepper jack cheese, keep in mind guys that you 're not limited to the type of cheese is that she decides to use already guys moving right along.
so preparation at this point in time we went to bring water to a boil and we went to add about a tablespoon to two tablespoons of olive oil, and this would prevent the pasta from sticking together as well, as a couple pinches of salt to flavor the water, adding the elbow macaroni to the pot we 're going to allow it to boil.
let 's say is sure to check the back of the box for the al dente cooking time because every brands of pasta, has a different cooking time?
once the pasta is al dente, we want to add it to the strainer, straining it off and definitely adding cold water to the pasta to stop the cooking process, placing our pasta side.
we want to move once and making a cheese sauce in a defense, kill it.
we 're going to add the butter once the butter is melted.
we want to add the flour and what we 're doing is, we 're making what 's called a root of root is used as a thickening agent to make different sources.
starving continuously is going to assure that there is n't any lumps add seasonings to the mixture, while continuing sister after the season is combined at the half and, half and continue to stir once.
everything is combined.
we 're going to add the different cheeses to the mixture.
and we were n't allowed the cheese to melt while continuing sister at this point in time as you can see everything is beginning to thicken up, which is great, adding the pepper jack cheese to the mixture.
so our cheese sauce is going to have three flavors going on.
we 're going to have the sharp taste from the cheddar cheese as well as a hint of spice from the pepper jack cheese, and the creaminess.
not only from the velveeta cheese.
but also from the half and half.
so all of the cheese is combined together along with a half and half is going to create this nice, delicious, creamy texture cheese sauce test.
set guys you do n't have to limit yourself to the type of cheese is that i use.
there 's so many cheeses out there from fontina cheese to aussie, ogoh cheese to gouda cheese to mozzarella cheese just to name a few guys.
so just play around with it until you find what works best for you.
so i 've got my pans lined up ready to go.
and i 'm going to start by adding the elbow, macaroni to the pan first followed by the decadent creamy cheese sauce using my spatula.
i 'm going to distribute the cheese onto the pasta evenly and guys.
this cheese is so smooth and creamy.
all my goodness, it literally spreads like mayonnaise after the cheesy sauce is added.
we 're going to top with a combination of shredded cheddar cheese and pepper jack cheese adding more pasta, an repeating the process once again, we 're going to add the creamy cheese sauce on top using the spatula to spread the cheese on to the pasta evenly.
last but not least we 're going to talk with a combination of shredded cheddar cheese as well as pepper jack cheese place in the mac and cheese and.
so my three hundred and fifty degree fahrenheit preheated oven.
i 'm going to allow the mac and cheese to bake for about twenty five to thirty minutes or until the cheese melts alright guys.
so as you can see i a southern baked macaroni and cheese is finished baking this mac and cheese is so gorgeous.
it could represent itself as always, guys, thanks to cook him a tammy definitely give this video a thumbs up subscribe to step dated with all my latest videos and most of all guys enjoy.
