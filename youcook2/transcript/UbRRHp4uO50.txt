namastey , i 'm angela.
welcome to my kitchen.
today , i will be making rotties, rotties are made several different ways.
i will make whole wheat, plain roti.
they 're very delicious and very healthy.
the recipe i 'm making remake for rotties.
so i will use half cup of flower and pinch of salt mix it and put half a cup of lukewarm water and just make is softap dope.
OK , now this dough seems ready.
it should be solved so i will take just a couple of drops of oil on my pants.
and right here.
so it better is easier, tony.
and it does n't stick to my fingers is good to make the dough about five to ten minutes before if you are using the real whole wheat flour if you make it very early, then it changes the color.
so my door is ready.
now i 'm going to divide this in before parts and roll them between my two pumps, is malt balls do?
my balls are ready and i will start rolling them to roll it.
i need some flower.
it makes it easier to rome, and i already have my skillet on medium height.
i like to use the ironist connect becaus.
it totally comes out much better rolling is little bit hardware, but with lily practice, you can roll them, so this is about five inch diameter.
and you can see the place off it to see if my skillet is ready.
i 'm going to just put a couple of drops of water.
is this season less slowly my disconnect is done?
and i 'm going to put my roti over and wait till it is start changing the color little bit, and i use the spatula, uh, who make the rotties.
so you can just turn it left it a little bit and see if it has browned spots.
it has like not is not so wait for a few more seconds and you can see these bubbles coming on the top.
this is the another way, you know, that place is ready to turn.
so i 'm going to use this special.
not return the rotties.
and you can see these golden brown is parts now.
we should be able to see the same thing on the other side, and you can see them.
i 'm going to turn it again, and just very with light hand i 'm going to go around, and it will pop up.
that 's our ot should pop up and just turn it and see if how it looks other side.
and this is ready now.
i 'm going to just put little bit guy or the killer butter and it 's ready to serve if somebody is eating hot, otherwise, you can project in deep end, while you are making the other parties.
no , this is my last roti.
so keep rolling it not hard by the time you will roll your fourth rotiroti, you will have enough practice and it 's OK, if you have to put use the flowers more than one time to roll it, and here it goes and just wait, you will see the colors changing and start bubbling little bit, so, you see, you can start seeing these bubbles coming up this time to change time to change darla game and just with the very soft hands conditions at all small teams ready.
