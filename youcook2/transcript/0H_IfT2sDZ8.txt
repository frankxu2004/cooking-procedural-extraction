hi , anyhow, i 'm sure tom will come to fortune cooking today.
i 'm going to show you how to make the famous korean kalbi short trip.
an I have a slap of the beef.
short ribs with bone and also i have the sauce already make i will list the ingredients for you.
and also i have processor food processors with green onion, onion garlic, an asian peers OK blend that and i 'm going to mix them with the sauce and marinate the ribs for overnight.
the next thing i 'm going to pull this on the top of the ribs, i just going to brush to really quick just like this, and then i 'm going to pull the sauce over the ribs , OK.
and then i 'm going to put in the fridge and let them marinate for overnight, or you can just do it like four to six hours.
there 's plenty time, an at the korean restaurant, you can order lotto like short ribs that usually come with a really thin slices with the bones.
but this one, i got is the whole slap alright.
OK , i show you how to make it marinate the short ribs overnight.
that 's what they look like nice and happy grill.
and i put my grill on medium and you can use the pain.
or you can use butter for the short with butter is really tasty, get a better flavor.
so i just like the code over the border OK.
not much just like this, and then you make sure your girl is like a medium heat, OK.
and then you just going to put place.
the ribs one by one, like this.
OK , i usually put the meat side down first.
and the thought is so tasty.
is really good with the rice over with the rice.
so that 's what i 'm going to do you want to grow about maybe four to five minutes on each side?
after two minutes, you get them a quick brush just like this.
let the sauce drizzle down to the bottom of the rifts was marinate into the give them more flavor to the meat just like this OK, after five minutes, i checked one piece.
it look really good.
the smell is so amazing right now.
we just give them a quick lift, just like this.
OK , you flip every one of 'em.
and , then you give them a quick brush again.
here we go just like this OK.
and this time we 're going to cook to another five minutes after two minutes and give him a quick brush.
get the more flavor.
here we go and keep in the medium heat.
OK , OK, now it 's done and what i usually do is, i flip it one more time.
OK , which is the meat side.
i turned over.
look how good i look.
and then what i did is the sauce.
you do n't want to go to waste.
you just put the sauce in like this, anne let the sauce nice and cooked and the heat high and let the soft caramel eyes nice and take and you can use the sauce to pull over the rice and.
so delicious this source is.
you do n't want to go to waste.
all right what i did.
i just going to wait until the sauce bring to a boil OK.
after a couple minutes, the source is nice and thick, is ready to serve, and the meat is not over cook.
because the five minutes on that side on the big size literally just kind of like a medium rare.
so now you gotta more source, camel eyes.
and give them eat more flavor now we ready to serve here.
is your delicious, korean cloudy, short ribs?
my kids going to love this.
