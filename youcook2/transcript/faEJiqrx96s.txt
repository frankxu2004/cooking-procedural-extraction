and then we 're going to cook are colby to go there.
some john and our mooch EMS i think what i 'm going to do take out my broiling pan.
i like to put a little bit of foil hibernate, japan, because there is, because there 's so much sugar.
can be a really sticky mrs, clean up switch?
we 'll take our colby and will line it up in the pan and this copy is n't very thickly caught, so it wo n't take forever to cook.
of course, if you can do it on the grill that 's even better i 'm going to get all that delicious grill flavor to go with it.
so here 's your call.
be nice dinner for two.
you 've got your mood gyms, which we can arrange on the plate on your side dish plate.
you got rice greens and meat that we 're going to stick in the broiler for about four minutes per side.
and you have your traditional korean barbecue.
