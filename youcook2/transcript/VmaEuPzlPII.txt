hi , this is jayden from steamy kitchen dot com by request.
i am going to teach you how to make cheater, poti pad thai is one of the most popular noodle dishes in thai cuisine.
it is so easy to make with a cheater sauce.
but it is.
so easy to get wrong.
so i 'm going to show you in this video, some of the tips to make sure that you can make perfect pot.
i authentic pad thai sauce from scratch requires tamarind paste, which is really hard to find in regular grocery store.
so i 'm going to teach you how to make really good tasting pot pie from premade, jarpa thai sauce.
we 're making shrimp pot ties.
so i 've got shrimp here.
i also have an egg, scramble the egg in a small bowl.
and then i 've got lots of garlic.
now this is my vegetables.
i 've got snow peas and bean sprouts and this.
my friends is the magical pot, thai sauce dried rice noodles.
i found these at my regular grocery store as well, we 're using dried rice noodle and first thing, you have to do is soak the dried rice noodle in hot water, just squish it all in there and make sure all the noodles are submerged.
i put a bowl on top of it just to keep hoping noodles in the water for the snow peas.
i want you to cut them diagonally, lengthwise so they look just like this.
so after soaking the rice noodles for ten minutes, they should look like this software.
there 's still a little hard, but they are ready to be drained.
we 're going to get ready to do the stir fry, he a walk, or the largest pan.
you have an go ahead and heat it up until very hot.
and we 're going to cook the shrimp.
you want to cook the shrimp on both sides just about halfway.
so a minute on each side is good he do n't want to fully cook the shrimp were going to add the shrimp back into the pot a little later.
but stir frying them halfway does something very important one and make sure you get a nice sear on the outside and number two it make sure you do n't over cook the shrimp.
how do you take a shrimp out?
you 're halfway cooked shrimp, you 're going to just leave your pot on an ad in your egg, and you 're going to scramble the eggs until the eggs.
are just said.
again you do n't want to over cook the eggs either so go ahead and put those in the same bowl as the shrimp and now.
we 're going to add some garlic.
i turn down my heat.
just a bit.
because i 'm adding garlic, i do n't want to burn the garlic, added my vegetables give it a good stir fry for just about thirty seconds or.
so once you start smelling the garlic time to add in the pot thai sauce and.
now it 's time to add in your drained rice noodles that have been soaking just add everything to it use tongs.
it makes it so much easier.
pick everything up.
move it around.
you want the sauce and all the vegetables to distribute wealth and guess what it 's time to add back in the half cook shrimp and the egg.
give everything a good toss with your toms that empty jar of pot thai sauce well, i added a bit of hot water to that, or just water shook it around.
because i want every single bit of that sauce.
i 'm just going to add again, let that cook for a couple minutes.
and that 's it you are done.
i top it off with some chopped penis at some spread, cilantro, on that, serve it with a wedge of lying.
if people like to have just a little more tank to the dish.
but you are ready to serve that was less than ten minutes of cooking time super easy to make and make sure you number one soak your rice noodles in hot water and that will help you prevent overcooking of the rice noodles later and to make sure you cook your ship first and take them out when they 're just halfway cooking that will help you make sure perfectly cooked if you have any questions at all and to see the full recipe head over to steamy kitchen dot com slash one.
