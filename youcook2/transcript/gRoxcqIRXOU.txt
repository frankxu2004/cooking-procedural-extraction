hi , and welcome to the bread kitchen.
no indian male is complete, without a chapati or two.
so here 's how to make them so to make these two patties.
i 've got one cup of chapati flour where you can use just plain all purpose flour, and i 'll add in a third of a cup of water.
the pinch of salt.
it , to a soft dough now, depending on your flower, you might need to add in a little bit extra water.
i usually adding a teaspoon extra time until i feel the dough is going to be nice and soft OK.
i 've got a really nice softap, doh here.
now i 'll need the dough on a lightly floured surface, pro about three or four minutes just to make sure it 's really, well, mixed.
it 's lovely and soft.
it 's a bit like to be like clay soft clay.
now i 'll just put it back in the bowl cover.
leave , it to rest for fifteen minutes after those had a good rest.
pop it on your board.
and we 're going to cut this into four pieces is when all the pieces into little borns.
now get yourself a flat pan over a medium high heat like industrial work surface.
take one of the balls and kind of press it out to about two inch diameter.
we keep fingers and thumb.
and they roll it out into a circle that put out six inches in diameter, getting quite thin.
now keep turning it as you roll it, and it 'll be more or less circular by the time you finished.
i think i 'm fairly happy with that.
i 'm going to take this across and helping downtime on nice hot pan.
and i 'll just leave it sit there for about twenty thirty seconds.
and after twenty seconds or flip it over and after twenty thirty seconds, flip it over again whoops.
and you should notice.
it 's starting to kind of poor for pop.
and when it starts to puff up images spatula to help drive the air bubble through the chapati sometimes.
it wo n't put like a bull.
because you get a little hole develop and the steam escapes through that little hole rather than popping up the chapati printer repair every twenty seconds.
or so, so, yes, there we care fair we get there.
it is look both for, for, for, for flocka big puffball.
i football with that.
get that over one more time, and when it 's got, these brown spots on it, and it 's profitable, i that he 's cooked.
so we can pop it on a plate and get on to the.
no , i need, is a nice steaming hot curry to eat these with jim?
parties are always best fresh, but they will keep for a day or two in a plastic bag.
i hope you enjoy making your trip at ease and do join me next time in the bread kitchen.
