i am antonio carluccio.
welcome to my kitchen.
i show you how to make the real carbonara.
most of the people they get it wrong, and i will show you.
why now this is boiling water for which we add in duration of ten grams per liter of water, sold as to be ladies and immediately then we put in as to be boiling a pastor in this case is sort of sparg.
it tony the biggest size of spaghetti, while this is hooking it fix good ten minutes and no audio, please.
you do n't need it.
you just need to still a little bit when it 's in it.
and they said now for the origonal karbala, you need the gun challenge, which is the chief the poultry, and the romans.
there is special in there because they do it, hewlett lee ham or like pancetta and is very tender, very tasty intent.
now you have to cut it in chunks, you can use naturally also and shattered the normal computer, which is this one here.
but i like the one charlie when i hear it obviously, and this is a recipe for two people.
big johns romans, they 're mad for this faster, if there is a roman pastor, is this one here this quite a lot?
so two people that see and the only thing you have to do now to make the sources today.
good olive oil put it a pen.
the young could tell one charlie into that, and this is the beginning of the souls and mostly also the end of it.
because the rest is coming here into that both and now.
you take some good eggs and for two people you take two eggs, call lovely color look at this, to be a little naughty.
i take just the yolk and we beat it to these.
you do that any, any, any creed absolutely forbidden, so this is the beginning of the source.
so we put a bit of parmesan at in roma they use also pecorino cheese, which is achieved to be grated their fresh paperino, an age category.
but it 's lovely to have this abandoned pattern and another sister, and this is the soul.
i would n't put any sold here.
because the bacon here it said quite sold the SAP reserves be reduced a little bit.
because i 'm going to see what the pastor does.
i can see it is still stiff.
so i put it back again another three or four minutes.
now he is the bait.
and that it 's produced also.
quite a lot of fat should you be not wanting the fact.
i show you a little trick here.
we are can do this.
you absorb limit of the fat, and you take it off like this very simple.
so the pastor seems to be doing well here now should be enough.
i switched off that one charlie because his two hawkins is exactly what i do n't want to be too hot.
so now i take the pasta.
and i put it into the yes there.
and you flavor it like this, you let it cool down in doing this and i should n't be too hot.
becaus , what is going to happen now, should be the temperature enough to coat the edge around the pastor?
now it comes to.
yes , there is east owns the actual source that you are.
and now we study like this, do you see usually buy did stage the heat is.
so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become, scrabble takes not tools cramblit.
and this is the karbala.
and now the last touch, which is the embellishment farmers and or pecorino depending would you like, and in my opinion, also a nice touch of peppa this is decoration for me.
and this is the real carbonara.
be only one in this exactly.
or should it be creamy without adding crying.
because this is the usual thing like this is just fantastic.
me , condom and everybody should this is just one.
