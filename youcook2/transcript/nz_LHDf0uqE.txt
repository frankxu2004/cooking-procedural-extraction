most of, you know, many mostly healthy lately.
and , uh, but today, i 'm really craving something fried.
i 've never been to england.
but every time i go to an english pub, and i have the fish and chips, they always taste really good, you know, being a southern boy.
but i 've got some card today, and we 're going to try to make some fish and chips to see how it goes OK.
so we 're going to take out potatoes.
now when you do this.
it 's not an exact measurement.
think it 's one of these things, if you make layers of potatoes and if you 're cooking, needs go ahead and cook some up extra, and you can save him once they 're done you get thrown in the refrigerator they 're fine for a day or two.
do n't worry about it?
i 'm not going to spoil well, anyway.
this makes a perfectly cooked potato.
they 're not soft enough for mashed potatoes.
they still have a little bite tool and if you follow this method, i 'm sure you 'll be happy with it.
so and then you can use these potatoes for you.
can do baked potatoes with them?
you can fry on whatever so anyway.
you gonna need a bunch of salt is what you really, salt.
and is the water is not an accurate thing.
and then when they are done, they still will need just a little bit of salt.
so this get some almost salty enough what we 're going to do we 're going to put water in , here.
and we 're going to cover him at least one inch.
i 'm ago about an inch and a half.
two inches on these little bit bigger, using, their real small potatoes you can go and answer three quarters of an inch something like that.
but what 's going to happen.
is whenever these are done boiling the map.
the thermal mass it 's left from the water in the particular thing will finish the cooking process.
now you do have to start this ahead of time.
because when we turn off the heat we 're going to let these set for two.
two hours going to take time to get him to boil, so you 're looking at about two and a half hours to get these potatoes.
anyway , i will put him on stove now.
so that i 'm sitting on the stove and we 'll take it, put my burner on high, and we 're going to bring this to a boil alright, see what we got going on here.
it 's not a rolling boil.
but it 's a real good summer, and i do have an electric stove.
so that burner is going to stay hot for awhile.
so what i 'm gonna do, do n't put this lid back on here is we wanted to hold the heat, turn the burner off and then we 'll come back in about two hours OK.
so here it is two hours later or a little more than two hours 'cause it 's not exactly a two hour thing before this water off, makes it a little cold water for the saints.
so that we get all the, all the water out of there were just going to let these things sit and cool down a little bit.
so i can handle him later.
so let 's start on our batter i 'm going to use one teaspoon of baking powder well, i have one cup of self, rising flour in here will put one teaspoon baking powder.
because i want to make sure that this rises up and then i 'm going to put half a teaspoon of salt.
i 'm here, you could put more salt or less salt depending on how you like it, but i 'm keeping this kind of neutral.
we 're going to do after we mix this up a little bit.
we 're going to take him.
we 're going to put this in the refrigerator and let it get nice and cold.
that 's going to take about ten, fifteen minutes.
so we have cold flower.
kolbo cold beer.
and i 've got one cup of beer measured out.
here , and it 's going to take a little more than that.
but is one cup is a good starting point.
so everything is cold.
and that 's a freshly opened beer.
it 'll foam up.
so we 're going to give us a mix now depending upon your flower.
you may need to add more beer.
or you may not like this is looking pretty good.
all right now, i 'm going to put this in the refrigerator, well, you know, what quite mix there, i just not as thick as i want last time.
i did this with a different flower.
i had to actually go to one cup of flour and one in a quarter cup of beer.
i will put another little bit of flour in there mix that there we go.
there 's the thickness i 'm looking for right there now, we 're going to put this back in the refrigerator for about five minutes.
OK , so now let 's make our chips if you will.
and you got an option to peel these, if you want to.
i 'm not going to do that today.
see that, that 's cooked.
you could eat that just like it is, we 're going to take cut these in the big.
i want a big pieces.
and if you wanted to peel these probably the easiest way to do it would be to take a spoon and pilum.
OK , so my oils coming up the temperature.
so what i 'm going to do is, i 'm gonna start, dropping are potatoes in there.
and will start pudding some color on these things.
i want to handle these pretty careful because they 're fully cooked and they 'll just break apart.
if you 're not careful with him.
OK , so my oils coming up, the temperature.
so what i 'm going to do is, i 'm gonna start, dropping are potatoes in there.
and will start to put in some color on these things.
i want to handle these pretty careful because they 're fully cooked and they 'll just break apart.
if you 're not careful with them and then whenever there done to the color that you want just take him out.
put him on some paper towels sprinkle a little salt on.
then soon as they come out of the oil awesome around that salt a little bit and then continue cooking your next batch.
so when you finish cooking your chips take your fish be careful, careful would handle it gently dip it in your batter.
i remember everything is cold and we 're going to ease this into the oil alright.
so now we cooked our fish on all sides, make sure we got some nice color.
all the way around chris up the batter, really good, even these little crunchy bits in here.
we 're going to turn the heat off and they take our fish out.
i see mario.
i 'll play this up and serve OK, not being an englishman never been to england, i wonder, how did i know we 're supposed to have malt vinegar on this.
but let 's just try playing potatoes are really good.
but this is hot singapore.
how does that look.
