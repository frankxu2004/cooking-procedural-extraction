hey guys welcome back to macro, eating today is going to be a little special.
i 'm going to cook you this now.
i do n't see this lightly.
this is some of the juiciest, tastiest chick in that.
i 've ever had a lot of times.
we have chicken breast.
it 's dry or it 's tasteless and i 've got a kind of force.
it down my throat just to get that protein content, not the case with this recipe, this recipe will make juicy tasty chicken that you can adjust to.
however you want it.
i had this chicken with pasta, with burgers within chili 's and soups.
sometimes it just like difficult in sauce by itself, if you guys pay attention to any of my videos or cook.
really , really try this one out.
it 's super tasty.
you 're never going to look at chick in the same way again.
let 's see, how it turns out.
so , the first thing you want to do is sharpen up a knife.
if you do n't have a chefs knife should probably get one there only twenty five bucks in amazon and then get your chicken.
what i 'd like to do with the chicken.
you do n't have to do this.
i turn off all the fat and.
so that way you do n't have any chewy pieces.
but here 's the important part guys, you want to cut this chick in really thin.
if you look at the video here, you can kind of see how i do really press hard with a knife against the chicken.
and it cuts into pieces that are anywhere from like an eighth of an inch, too inch thick.
but what you really want to do is you want to make him all the same thickness.
that way they cook evenly no once all your chickens cut up.
you 're going to move on to the breadcrumb mixture here.
i 'm just using trader joes, bread crumbs use whatever you want poured into a bowl.
i do n't really measure here, but i suppose it 's like three fourths of a cup, then add your spices here.
i 'm using coriander smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, and do n't forget your pepper.
so what i do is i just mix it into a bowl and add generous amounts.
the more amount that you add the more flavor chicken is going to have on the outside like i said use what you want experiment with different spices, whatever have been pantry that sort of thing together and then you 're just going to bread all these chickens now.
i like to brett each one individually to ensure they all have a full coat on them.
but do what you want use the shake and bake method it 's going to kind of look like this, once you 're done with the breading and then just continue on, keep reading each one of the chickens, do you end up with a big pile at this point you 're going to want to heat up a pan with about a tablespoon of olive oil in there, here, i used walnut oil, or you can use coconut oil whatever you have on hand you want to make sure that it 's nice and hot to liquid kind of, looks like this, then add your chicken, your chicken should pop a little bit when you add it to the pen the key part here is you really want to get oil on each one of those chickens just a little bit or they 're not going to crisp up once you have all your chickens in the pan just like this you 're going to hear this a beautiful chris baking sounds now, these things are only going to have to cook for about three to four minutes.
you 're going to see white edges and at that point you 're going to flip them over.
and they should look like this, this should have this nice brown crispy crunchy texture on the outside that just looks amazing.
now at this point you 're just going to want to cookies for about another thirty seconds, or so.
then , you 're done.
and you 're going to get this crispy, steamy delicious looking chick in that you can make all these different recipes with it 's.
so versatile as you can see you can make all these recipes from just one chicken recipe.
these are super simple recipes that i put together as an example to show you guys of what you can do with this chicken.
here we just have n't put onto a bird with roasted red peppers.
we also serve it with some sweet potato chips, along with some kale chips.
if you 're feeling lazy, and you do n't want to actually cook anything what i like to do is just put it on the bed of baby spinach with the sauce in the middle or feeling like you want italian food.
you can put it on some weak positive, with some red marinara sauce.
some parsley tastes really good.
or if you want to get super fancy with it and press it like i did here, here.
i have some brown rice with some sauteed, spinach served with a side of roasted red pepper here.
it just paired it with a nutty, citrus, minty, parsley, puree.
but you can basically add whatever you want over here depending on how adventurous you want to be.
i really recommend this recipe.
