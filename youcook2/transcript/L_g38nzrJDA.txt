hello , welcome to DDS.
today , i 'm going to be preparing a salad called the touche seduce, is a mediterranean or middle eastern salad that has a lot of different vegetables in it and it has a nice crispiness which comes from the fried peter bread?
there 's added to it.
we 're going to start off by trapping up certain romaine lettuce.
now we use romaine lettuce because it has a firmer texture that can hold well after it 's mixed.
with the lemon juice that we 're going to add later on, you want to finally chop the romaine, lettuce some people use iceberg.
i prefer romaine and it has more of a tason.
more nutrients than iceberg lettuce now, i cut it into shreds.
i 'm gonna place it, money is a fairly large bolts.
you want to be able to mix all the ingredients together later on, next.
i 'm going to chop up the peppers.
i 'm using three different kinds of peppers.
i 'm using orange red and green, can also use yellow, but these peppers have a lot of vitamin C.
they actually have more vitamin C than oranges.
do you wanna cut them into small, small cubes?
is peppers got great zany taste?
and it turned out to be about a half cup to three fourths cup of each kind of pepper and this salad serves about four people.
now i 've already pre sliced everything else, except for the cucumber.
i sliced half of it.
show you want to cut it in half, and you want to quit in quarters.
and , then also you want, you know, your vegetables to be all kind of the same size, so there we go there 's a cucumber.
have , a cup of shredded red cabbage for purple cabbage, a fourth cup or about two radishes also chopped up?
i have one tomato or about half clock to three fourths.
cup finely chopped tomatoes, i have a quarter cup of shredded carrot.
i have a quarter cup of diced green onions.
i have a quarter cup of diced red onion, you can use yellow one in that 's fine.
and then i have half cup of chopped.
parsley , now you can add fresh minton.
or you can add dry, and i like to add dry mic to the salad about a tablespoon of dried mint.
another ingredient that complements a salad very well, is samach?
it 's spelled S U M, A C is actually a dried groundberry that 's found in tropical climate areas, you could find this almost all of your grocery stores or specialty grocery stores.
you want to add about two tablespoons of drag some luck for the dressing.
i squeezed two lemons and two garlics matched with some salt to this.
i 'm going to add about a quarter cup of olive oil.
make sure you pick a very good olive oil.
'cause it adds a lot of flavor to the salad, and also compliments all the vegetables.
and then mix it up a little bit.
and then i 'm going to add to my salad, it 's good to mix the garlic with the lemon juice and olive oil.
so you would n't get a big chunk of garlic, so, if you put it in there, you might stick together.
but if you dissolve it in the lemon juice and olive oil it 's sure to mix in with all of the other ingredients.
i 've also fried some whole wheat.
pita bread, you can use regular peter butter you can use whole wheat.
pita bread also put it on some napkins to absorb all the excess oil.
i 'm just going to break it up into my salad, like so you have to be chopped or anything just break it up with your fingers.
you want to fry it, and some vegetable oil, this until it 's browned be careful not to burn include this prior pretty quickly.
there we go.
now you 're going to want to mix the whole style together, and you can mix it with a spoon, or you can mix it with their hands.
the flavor taste just as good as the color after you thoroughly combined, the ingredients, you want to get a plain colored plate like a white plate 'cause there 's.
so much color in this salad, you want to bring it out.
ana white plate, will bring up all of the other colors that are in here?
just get it get the plate, plate.
the fattoush in the center of the plate, and voila, you have a great looking salad all the colors.
the crispiness of the peter bread you can top this with some grilled chick in some steak.
eat it with a side of homeosaurus side of public good news.
it 's great, has so much flavor you can eat it by itself, you can use it for lunch, it will fill you up.
it 's a great salad, looks a little complicated.
but it 's not you just have to chop up all the vegetables, you 'll have so much fun doing it.
and you 'll get so many compliments enjoy it.
enjoy me again for DDS.
