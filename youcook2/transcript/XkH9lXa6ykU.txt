this grid recipe is a great pub classic, but we are going to be using lemonade.
so this is a really simple pub classic dish with calamari.
we 're going to cut our squared into rings and then back to it in a really simply lemonade some pure cool.
so dancing your ingredients we 're going to start with our fresh squid.
so if you can take this and.
now the screen is already being prepared.
it 's been skinned case.
it 's taken over that cost, each out.
the middle orb impact, forced by a fishmonger.
so we need to do is cut into rings sort of active finger thickness little finger may be perfect and even these little bits at the end.
although then not uniform in shape the rest, do n't waste?
we can squeeze really cheap so these fresh squared less than one pound fifty.
no , from the supermarket while you do that i 'm going to show you the batter, which is so simple.
it 's more like a tempura batter, so you need flower.
this is just self raising flour, which lines.
it 's already got a bit of sort of raising the key is ice cold fizzy liquid so action purer.
you sparkling water ice cold to go with this.
we 're going to use a cloudy lemonade, lemonade, still got a few ice cubes in there, we needed to be cold.
and if you can just wish that in J, the exception of the few ice cubes should be completely lump free season up well, salt and pepper.
but you can see those bubbles reacting with self rising flour as well.
lee lights and fluffy and that 's it.
we 've got a squid ready to go.
you can, of course, get these frozen already in the ring.
so you could even get rid of that job, and we 've got our batter, which is nice and smooth if you can just put the script back into our bowl.
so we 've got over here some hot oil is at one hundred eighty degrees celsius if you have n't got fryer by all means use a pan of oil on the stove.
but be careful, be careful you do need quite precise, is too low?
you 'll get soggy better too high.
and the screen wo n't cook before the battle button, so you gotta be careful.
really like crispy batter and just pop them in about oil company.
how easy this is the squirrel cook really quickly, so you want to get the few in at once, so they will cook together perfect.
i will leave those to cook for that two or three minutes until we go nice and crispy, very, very simple dip to go with it, like squared we do n't want to add too many flavors to overpower it.
so , just mayonnaise and lemon juice, which you cannot choose possess.
if you just testing lemon into that and plenty of black pepper really simple flavors.
so you have fond memories of squared.
i do actually.
it really reminds me of sitting in spain on the beach in a little cheating guy.
top little barfing out there history goes with appear in the sun on the beach, lemon mayonnaise goes into our dip pop will start get ready to serve.
some fresh rocket just to soak up any of that excess grease with the color over here.
i 'll square dot already done so well.
if that got nice golden color is screwed in the middle kirk, so just drain off an excessive amounts of oil on there.
yeah , you do n't just have to use the body of the squared, you could do the tentacles as well, that 's a little bit of salt just season.
those up as well, we only need so slight twist from the usual by using that cloudy lemonade.
and it gives a fantastic crispy batter that you can hear that there.
so there we go exactly as we wanted our cloudy lemonade squared.
let 's take this.
question is as good as once you have a whole day play lovely now, is really good lemonade, maybe not this crispy and slightly sweet and the rocket lemon juice, finger food pop food autofix.
it so easy do a double question.
it was lovely amazing route.
