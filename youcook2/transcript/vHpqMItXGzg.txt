boneless buffalo chicken wings.
so we have some egg wash.
this is just a little bit of milk over a little bit of water.
and we have some all purpose flour, so we 're going to solve this flower.
put some pepper in the flower and a little bit of garlic powder stuff.
a little bit she is all incorporated in there.
we 're going to do.
we 're just going to bread the chicken down side so we have our chick in.
now we 're just going to put this in a little bite size chunks alright, alright here.
we go here 's we 're going to live in flower on them.
yes , it wo n't affect package quality pressing down.
and we 're just going to do that with all of them.
and then we 're going to go into the oil.
OK , see you in a second alright.
so once we have a bunch of am we 're just going to go into the oil, so this is about medium peep.
and then, while these are cooking, we 're just going to read some more.
but this cook for about five minutes on each side.
so now we just take him out of the oil and vinegar for around ten fifteen minutes, just flipping every few minutes and.
now the next part is the sauce alright.
so for the authentic buffalo hot sauce we 're going to use franks.
of course, and going to use about three tablespoons of butter in a bit of leanne, parents and salt pepper and a lot of garbage and we 're going to put this in the microwave just to melt the butter alright.
so how i like to do it is take my wings, put him into a metal bowl like that.
can you come in with a little bit of your hot sauce quote over top and toss it around?
make sure they get all covered at your plate.
and , of course, a side of blue cheese there you go hope you enjoy this video and have a great day.
