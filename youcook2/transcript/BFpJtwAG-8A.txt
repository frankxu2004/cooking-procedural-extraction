her way it 's mark thomas, a home outdoor expert and today.
i 'm bringing you an awesome recipe.
this is how you cook brotz, you start out in the kitchen, and you simmer in a pan.
i 'll go through those steps a minute, and then you transfer it to your grill, and i 'm going to cook this over charcoal.
'cause i think charcoal is the way to go.
i do use gas.
i like it, it 's nice and convenient and there 's ways to make it taste really good.
but today, i 'm going to go all out with the charcoal, so let 's go through the steps.
OK , first, before i get started with this i want to give a shout out to my friend.
john , the game in this recipe.
john , if you see this, call me.
i will buy you a beer crap here.
anyways john is from wisconsin.
he 's a packers fan, and they know nothing about grilling, and he said believe it or not miller high life.
he said cook it in this for twenty minutes.
we 're going to pour this into smaller cast iron pan here, been warming up a little bit.
and , you know, i have n't had miller.
well , it 's been a long winter.
this , my first time grilling, brats for this season.
so it 's been a long time that i 've had miller high life is not the type of very normally drink.
but that 's the best way to cook brats.
huh , yeah, alright interesting stuff, yeah, i got three bryant 's here.
and what you do is you keep this up enough.
so you just see it just a little bit of steam, coming off and let it go like that for twenty minutes, you do n't want to overcook it where you split the skin on it.
so let 's check back after they 've been cooking here.
they are just under way and the pens gotta, warm for little bit more it 's not steaming yet, but you can see the beer is bubbling alright.
now you can see i stepped outside the charcoal chimney starter going this is made by weber.
this one works awesome.
just a couple sheets of crumpled newspaper light it and prob about twenty minutes later, we will have just the blazing fire.
let 's go back inside.
OK , i put the brats, and it may be hard to see.
but it 's just there 's little uh, steam coming off the pan not that hot so it 's not going to split the skin.
all right here the breaths are underway about three to four minutes.
i 've turned him once nice little color there and look to the side here.
this is the kind of ear.
i enjoy while grilling hey guess what kind of beer i 'm drinking, and this is going to be my first giveaway.
if you 're the first one to guess what kind of drinking i will ship you.
this free brand, new weber bamboo skewer set model, sixty six oh eight.
so good luck and the rules are you cannot guess until somebody else guesses, and if you guys are n't figure it out.
i 'll give you a hint along the way.
and here we are back to the grill, nice and slow low heat.
no need to rush the best way to do it.
and this is why i love about charcoal look at the smoke that rolls off just that extra flavor that you get from circle.
