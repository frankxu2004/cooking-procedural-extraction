hi guys, i am back in my kitchen in dublin, and i 'm so happy to be here.
BIH , cause i 'm going to make for you, a very delicious little supper very easy to make it is vodka penne, are really wonderful new classic italian recipe, which is a tomato creamy sauce and is so.
so simple to make starts in the pan with a little bit of pancetta and some butter.
frying your punch at a or smoked streaky bacon in the butter is going to bring it so much flavor.
has this wonderful salty taste?
if you cannot get punched out at smoke.
streaky bacon just caught up nice and fine is perfect, and does the job, so in with that.
i some nice chunky stuff here.
i just want to fry it down until you get a nice sizzling golden color.
this has to be one of the most simple pasta dishes, you will ever make it takes literally about ten minutes, you will have the source done in the time.
it takes to cook the pasta.
i already have mine done while they can or the pancetta is frying off.
i 'm just going to add in a little sprinkle of dried chili flakes.
now you do n't need to use these if you do n't want to, but if you like a bit of heat get them in there now.
the reason, this recipe get its name is be cause you add vodka to the source now.
it sounds like a bit of a strange addition here.
but the use of vodka in here intensifies the tomato sauce and kind of brings out the sweetness in there.
so it does have its uses.
i 'm going to add about four tablespoons into the pan here, and if you 're cooking, this for young people remember the alcohol is going to burn off.
so , do n't worry too much about it, so four tablespoons go in.
here it will sizzle it will fizz.
but do n't worry about it just needs to cook out just for luck.
so , once that has sizzled away, you want to get about three or four tablespoons worth of tomato puree in.
here all these things you can have on hand, and they literally just get thrown together to make a delicious meal once you have that amount of euro nicely mixed through what you need to add in is sort of double cream.
it is quite a heavy dish.
but , you know, what it is so creamy, and delicious.
once you put this in it 's worse pour that in and just mix it all through, you want to bring it up to it just kind of nice simmer, and then we 're going to add our past in.
so in alongside this lovely sauce, i 'm going to tumble the pastor with some parmesan cheese, and some piracy.
so give it a good grace on a microplane, grater like this, and you want to look for parmigiano, reggiano.
it 's the best of take.
a good handful of flat leaf parsley like this, and just rip off the stocks and put them to one side, and you should be left with a nice bit of leafage there and just roll this into an ice ball, and you kind of want to give it a rough chop.
you do n't have to be careful here, but it 's lovely to get flecks of green, in here, because it 's such a rich source.
it needs that fresh from the herbs nope.
i 've got a big bowl of penne pasta, which are cooked up and drained i know it 's ready to be added straight into the sauce.
just give it a really good mix through just sort of pastor is all completely coded and then just jump in that parmesan cheese lovely parmesan cheese and also some of that wonderful piracy in there as well, this is going to be absolutely delicious, just mix it all through and this is ready to rock a perfect little fifteen minute meal that will blow your mind at.
last , little bit of parmesan cheese and flat leaf parsley over the top and check this out a mega little pacifici, this is my vodka penne.
i want you to give it ago, it is so delicious.
and i 'm going to tell you how it 's delicious.
because i 'm going to try some.
so in with the garb that is.
so good creamy that vodka in there has intensified the tomato puree.
