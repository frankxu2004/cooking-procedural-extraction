hi guys welcome steve kitchen.
today , i 'm going to be teaching you how to make fantastic for levels and stick with me.
because through this little series, i 'm also going to be making the peter pockets.
and i 'm also going to make a tahini sauce from scratch.
so let 's get on today and make the best tasting flatter you 've ever tried, oh, and by the way, you 'll need to subscribe to the channel, if you have n't already if you want to see the other videos would be coming up over the.
next few days.
now for the best flavor of falafel you want to take your dried chick peas and just put them into a glass jar that 's a cup of chickpeas.
so we cut that piece, at least a couple of inches above the peace themselves.
and we 're going to lead them to soak overnight or at, least eight hours.
now you can use canned chickpeas as well, and that worked perfectly well.
just make sure you drain all the moisture out of those chickpeas before you start making the falafel OK.
let 's get these powerful started.
we 've got two cups of our cheap piece that we re hydrated overnight.
we put those into a bowl now.
the secret to really good falafel is lots of flavor chickpeas are not great on their own, i mean, they are good.
but look this is a whole bunch of parsley, and i 'm just going to chop that up roughly, and that 's going in the bowl as well.
it does n't have to be done to finally so just going to chop the whole lot up and pop it in stocks and all.
actually , not right down to the touch dots up that in with our chick peas and flavor, flavor, flavor i 've got four nice bunches here a nice great big lump of coriander or cilantro.
i think are americans call it and again just roughly chopping those up.
just going to pop those in and this is really, what makes the flavor, the smell coming off that cilantro, that cortana.
and i 've got two brown onions here that i 'm just going to cut up roughly again.
it does n't have to be too fine and bone.
now the onions the chick peas and all the herbs are in there were just going to mix that through with our hands.
now guys, my big food processor is not working at the moment.
so i 'm going to use this smaller one and i 'm going to do mine in two batches.
but it does n't matter flavor, flavor, flavor, this is what 's going to make the difference.
all these herbs and spices just look at the colors of that, now.
let 's blix that down.
you can decide if you wanted really fine, or whether you want it, fairly course, i prefer a fairly fine falafel.
i think it fries up, better.
now guys look at the colors of that, that is what falafel should look like its course, but reasonably fine.
it 's packed full of flavor.
the texture is moist, but reasonably dry.
it 'll hold together nicely.
but we have n't finished yet.
i 've got one tablespoon of coriander seeds.
whole seeds, not ground down.
just put those in there.
i 've got i get it.
this is one tablespoon of seat that i 've ground down to a fine powder coriander.
again i 've got one tablespoon of cumin, cumin as people call it put that in there and one tablespoon of ground cumin, a teaspoon and a half of regular salt.
and i really healthy portion of ground pepper.
now , i 'm using ground white pepper here.
but you can use ground black pepper, either will do now why did i use white pepper.
you might ask because i run out of black and white tastes really great.
anyway OK now take a spoon.
and we start to mix those spices in with the rest of our mixture.
here , now i 'll just show you now.
this is almost perfect.
but i think it 's a little bit.
i do n't know if i can you can see that there.
but it 's a little bit down.
now the way to combat that, and that 's.
because the herbs had a lot of moisture in them is just to add about a tablespoon to two tablespoons of flour into this mixture.
so sprinkle, some flour over there, this one favor spoon.
i 'll just follow that through and see if that 's enough now.
i think that 's enough flower there holding together nicely there still damp.
but let 's test this one and cook it off.
now i 've got a pan, a deep pan with about three inches of oil here.
and i want to bring the temperature of the soil up to about three fifty three seventy five degrees fahrenheit.
that 's one seventy five one ninety degrees.
celsius so recognize around about one seven five.
now test it with a little bit of red.
you see straight away that fizzled up and that 's going to cook nicely within thirty forty seconds that 'll be brown.
now ready for the falafels just making my full apples by hand, just roll them into a little almond shape and then just drop them into the oil.
OK , well, she 's bubbling away like that.
i 'm just going to use a slotted spoon to drop the rest of them in probably about four or five in at one time now for just gently.
but a slotted spoon in there, i mean, look at those they 're holding together beautifully.
they 've got a lovely crusty outside i 'm going to put those on some kitchen paper and let them drain.
and i 'm going to cook some more OK friday off my falafel there.
beautiful and crisp on the outside.
let 's just open that one up and inside you 've got all that flavor, and i can tell you that taste delicious.
that 's the best falafel i 've ever had.
now we 're going to take a falafel, are salad are?
tahini sauce were mixing altogether making one fantastic meal.
OK guys, firstly, i 'm going to make a quick tahini source, and i 'm using the fresh tahini that i made earlier you can buy shot, bought tahini.
but fresh is best so.
i 've got half a cup of tahini source there and i 'm just going to cut up a lemon fresh lemon.
and we want the sort.
the we want the juice in that lemon in the bowl first.
so i 've got all my lemon.
the keep old pit in there as well.
but my half a cup of tahini, then want half a cup of water in there as well, and i would just take a fork and mix app through, and then we just want to season it with about half a teaspoon to a teaspoon of salt, and i 'm just going to add one quarter of a cup of a thick greek yogurt into the mix as well and then mix that together with a fork, and we got this lovely thick dressing that will be using in our falafel right to go with awful after our little peter pockets were going to make a little fresh salsa.
now a simple shelter is often best we got red onions fresh tomatoes and cucumber.
and i 'm going to cut these up and ice them into little cubes.
so if guys are cucumber our red onion and tomatoes or tomatoes, american friends day, and we 're just going to pop those into a bowl together and then we 're just going to mix those fruit.
now i 've left all the skin on the cucumber as well, it adds beautiful color there.
so were set aside in the fridge ready to use, when are flapping already to construct OK guys?
we 've got our pita pockets now, and we 're just going to have to cut a piece off the top.
and i 've opened up the pocket inside.
now this can get a little bit messy.
we 're going to take a couple of our full apples and pop them inside their drop them into the bottom.
and then we 're going to take a spoonful of that shelter that builds salads.
how so that we make and pop that in there, and i want a big spoonful of the tahini sauce dressing and then another couple of falafel.
some more salad and again our tahini sauce over the top of that now you take a look that is a falafel that 's going to taste absolutely delicious.
so there is my take on a perfect falafel in homemade pita pockets with your homemade tahini.
now guys you can buy tahini from shop does n't matter peters you can also buy.
but i 'm going to try this one now.
but not, while you 're watching is going to be messy.
