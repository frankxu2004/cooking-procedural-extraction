welcome to hoffman kitchen.

it 's a very simple destra mate.
i love it, it is going to be your favorite.
i promise you, so let 's get going.
we 'll start with garlic will chop it up fine and, you know how to chop garlic, take a claw.
you cut off the head, and then you smash it, just like that, they called the peel and start chopping finally.
so i have your boiling water on the stove.
there 's about five quarts of water.
i do n't about a tablespoon and a half of salt to the boiling water, and my phone is about a pound of connect, and i 'm going to let it boil while fast as boiling.
i 'm going to prepare the sauce.
i 'm going to pour about a quarter of a cup of olive oil.
the best quality olive oil can find possibly i 'm going to add on about a half a teaspoon of crushed pepper and about four close of garlic.
they 've shop before.
and i 'm going to have it just so, so take slowly just to make sure.
i can burn the garlic.
i would say on a low fire, and just watch it carefully.
so it does n't burn does n't turn yellow.
so you want to be just a little bit about a minute or so, turning golden before you add on the tomatoes.
so it 's been about a minute going on a pinch of salt.
anmi crushed tomatoes, i 'm going to have my sauce cook for about fifteen minutes.
and my past does just about down.
you just cook it, according to your instructions on the box, but this one is done.
and we 're going to drain it now, going to drain my pasta.
you want to make sure it 's drain thoroughly.
just shake it out so the water comes out.
and we 're ready to put it in into our sauce.
an we 're going to add on the pasta sauce mix.
it well, and we 're going to up here.
it is we 're going to add on two tablespoons of vodka that 's about two tablespoons, and we 're going to let it just toss it a little bit let their alcohol come out of the vodka and absorb into the faster.
you across it as well, and now we 're going to add on one cup of heavy cream and again toss it again, and it 's really nice.
we 're going to cover it and let it simmer on very low heat for about a minute or two.
now are plaster has absorbed.
the sauce is really wonderful thread to go actually if you want to serve it for kids do n't like green stuff.
serve it as it is or you can add on a quarter of a cup of parsley and mix it in into the panera.
i 'm not going to do it today since my kids do n't like parsley.
so i 'm going to do it, but it suggested to make sense.
