hi , i 'm john colter.
and i love bringing music and food together and today.
i 'm with newton forfeit.
hello , this is my house in the middle of making my fourth album and what we decided to do is.
open up the whole process to four webcams, which has been broadcasting everything for the passport.
thank you doubt, nor was going to put you down.
just let it all better.
though stuff looking down, we 're going to do some amazing dish, which we 've got these matter gets improved, you can get to know them.
things she thought so we 've got.
we 've got a shrink.
we 're going to do it with a really cool seaweed and chili garnish and in a great different source.
so you 've got this bad boy here and we 're going to do is we need to take the outer skin off.
so you just get in here, and you just kind of cry it apart along here app.
and then you just pulling it over there.
and now we 're going to do is that we 're just going to cook down his back top there as we do that you should open it up and then can you see that in there.
OK , and that sort of like you do n't want to eat that it 's not very flavorful and then you see i 've kind of just one, butterfly, again.
so just opened came up like that.
OK , now we 're going to make a tempura batter.
this is super simple.
really quick, and i think it 's one of those dishes that you want to learn how to do.
because you can do it with vegetables, you can do it with fish.
you can do it would make really awesome.
i 've got baking powder rock that in there, then we 've got some self raising flour.
and then we 've got some corn flour, and.
now we 're going to use a sparkling mineral water, you could use solar water.
but the important thing is, is that?
it 's really important that you do that the consistency we 're looking for is that you want to whisk everything basically all those bubbles out of going there are kind of lifting , it.
and that 's going to make it really light, so it 's important to whisk all the flower together and get a nice consistency.
but when you put your finger in just counts, we do n't want any lumps in there.
so it 's just coating my finger perfect, you want it to be like looking down at the ground, you said yourself pretty high level with this, this new arm.
you literally do n't even walk four weeks.
is that right?
yeah , we got we gave ourselves five weeks to get finished.
and this whole the way that we 've done it this process, is actually never been done before.
so at no point in the history of music is everyone kind of opened up the recording process?
quite this degree.
but the cameras are on all the time, so on all day and all night.
when i was worried about the kind of things i was like, well, how is it more exciting to get an album and here it for the, for the very first time, or to have heard it being made, and then hear the finished product, and it 's really unique is n't it, it 's really interesting start looking down.
so we 've done the prompts.
we 've got the banner done now.
we 're going to get this really cool seeking for the salt part.
we 're going to see wade if you can just start pounding that down.
and then i 'm going to do is i 've got these great mexican.
chili , really smoke it.
so i 'm just going to chop this down a little bit.
now remember if you do n't want the heat leave these seeds out.
that 's where the fire is, uh, i want a bit of fire and what i 'm going to do to add to, that is, i 'm just going to put in here just there.
we go perfect.
that 's delicious as it is, but then we want a really cool differential, and i love this difference office.
and sweet chili, dipping sauce that bad boy in there and then the next one if you want to put in there is there vinegar path the sour.
so in she goes, and then we 've got some fish source escorted her.
i toasted off some sesame E seeds there, going in and then.
this , this is going to make it really vibrant.
releasing glee really fresh, so we 're just going to get some coriander.
i 'm going to get some meant, you could use other fresh vibrant herbs like dill or parsley just going to blitz that.
so J OK.
now that, that 's done which is going to get it to send it through.
so we just got the little bits.
because the big ones that overpower it OK.
we 're ready to start frying.
so and then just get the bad boys and you can take the heads off if you want to and we just kind of put those in make sure that they 're all covered and you can still see the prawn underneath it.
so it 's like and then you hold it for a little bit, as if you just drop it straight in it will sink to the bottom.
stick to the basket and you have a you kill, somebody does n't breakdown.
yeah , i 'm not i ca n't do this anymore.
now they 're going to cook for about a minute and a half.
two minutes tops a hundred and ninety degrees, and you 're just going to see them.
turn of beautiful pink, and then the battle going to beautiful golden color.
they 're going to flip in taste, worthy to the max people and then a little thing that just adds to the season, which is just going to take it up a little bit.
but it 's going to add so much is a little bit of lemons.
this , so we just going to put a little bit in for that season.
OK , so trade off when she comes and then into the seasoning.
they go, and their hearts are going to pick up that beautiful seaweed and the chili, you can just wait come on here.
and then we 're just going to finish off would be nice wedge at eleven that 's my boy there.
and then we have the most amazing tempura shrimp which seaweed and pepper seedling, anarene, called sweet and sour differences, first, let 's just get a bite.
