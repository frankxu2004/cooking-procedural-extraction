are you ready for the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich?
if you are we 're going to do it three ways, one with harm, one with spiciness and one just regular old cheese.
so first things, first, we need to slice up our bread and get butter and grilled cheese, is just one of those ultimate comfort food sandwiches?
they are so easy to make and if you do it right, you have something that is just out of this world.
now , the bread, i 'm using is a white bloomer loaf, but if you can get your hands on this any old sandwich bread will work.
right i have the makings of some beautiful grilled cheese sandwiches.
so now it 's time to get buttering.
you 're going to want to butter your bread on both sides.
so inside you have this lovely salty, moist buttery taste.
but on the outside, you have this rich crispy, golden crunching that my friend is a proud pile butter bread, and.
now we need to talk about the cheese, and when i was making this as a kid, i certainly would n't have gone for clear and cheddar.
but this combination of strong irish white cheddar plus greer cheese is going to give you all the taste of cheddar.
but that lovely gooeyness that you get from greer cheese it 's a perfect melting cheese if you ca n't get your hands on either of these any cheese that will melt will do perfectly in the middle of these sound regions.
so it 's time for some grading action grab your box grater and then just great with degree actually, just take off the rind.
so slight that off write that off and graded on, and.
now it is time to talk about the ultimate cheese sandwich.
so i 'm going to do three variations on this.
the classic, which i 'm going to show you how to make.
now this is really complicated stuff by the way mix up your irish cheddar.
and that lovely gree air.
and then just sprinkle that on you want a generous amount here top that with another piece of bread and, that is cheese.
sandwich number one for cheese sandwich number two.
we 're going for a little bit of spicy action.
so i 've got some hot sauce.
you can use a rapture or whatever hot salsa fancy and just spread that across if you like it has.
this is the one for you, straight on top with cheese and then, that is grilled cheese option number, two and for grilled cheese option number three we 're going in for some logan savory harm to just nice thin slices of ham in there, in there with lots and lots of cheese and then you do have to press them all down i 'm going to fry these off on a griddle pan.
and you need to have these at a nice medium heat so they 're going to give you a lovely golden brown color.
if you do n't have one of these griddle pans.
just a normal frying pan will do the job.
it 's all about the signal.
do they smell good?
i 'm going to serve diesel their toasted their golden in there.
so all you gotta do now is talking, i do n't know which one, i 'm going to choose.
