so here we go we 're going to make a california sushi roll with the seaweed on the outside the ingredients.
we 're going to use our sushi.
rice avocado, surimi mayonnaise cucumber.
and of course nori, so.
let 's get going, and make california sushi roll, i 'll see in a second OK.
so let 's make california roll with the sushi on the outside the first thing we 're going to do is dip our hands in water.
so that we can handle the rice as i said there will be instructions for the sushi rice on my blood OK, we want to spread the rice all the way to the sides there we go, if you have to wait your fingers, a couple of times to spread the rice that 's OK.
because what we 're trying to do is spread the rice without breaking the rice in other words, we do n't want to smoosh rice.
we want those grains to be a hundred percent.
if we have to add some will grab some just like so.
OK , get those grains all the way to the site.
i said i like to leave three quarters of an inch to an inch of naked nori, facing me.
and i like to leave about three quarters of an inch to an inch of nori in front of me to seal the role, OK, there we go races spread nice and easy.
now one of my favorite things to do is sushi whether it 's california roll or any other kind of rule is mayo an as i 've stated before, if you 've never had mayo in your sushi you 're missing out.
because it 's delicious.
so i 'll spread a little mail.
actually spread a lot of mail because i really love mail on my sushi alright.
so we have the mail now to make california roll will take some avocado.
nice chilled avocado.
take it all the way to the ends.
OK , then we 'll take either crab or surimi crab can be a little bit expensive.
but siri me.
a work in, in this particular recipe, it is working, and then i 'm going to take some cucumber to put it right on top more often, there.
then i 'll grab the sheet, and i 'll fold it over the halfway point.
and this is why i use the lead on the seaweed to tuck it tight and then roll.
because i 'm not using them at to do this particular role roll.
it get back there.
you go OK if you feel any inconsistencies in the shape you can squeeze them out.
you do n't always have to use a mat.
then we have to cut the ends off.
so we, where are blade and we feel right about there blade, and we move that over, OK, what are blade again?
there is solid right about there.
take the blade, move that over OK.
but the blade again and decide where center is right about here take the slicer.
so bring the sushi together and cut it into three.
possibly even four pieces wet the blade again.
will make three pieces here it will be slightly different in sizes?
but that 's OK, yeah, there you have it california sushi roll with the seaweed on the outside.
i 'm going to played it, and you 'll see what it gets to look like in just a second.
i 'll be right back.
OK , there you have it california sushi roll with seaweed on the outside served with what sabi and pickled ginger and excellent dish for the summer.
nice refreshing cooling and the only time you have to turn on your oven is to make the rice enjoy.
