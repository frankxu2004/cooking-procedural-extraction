we 're going to some canola oil, heat up the oil.
i 'm pudding about since we 're making three cans of chickpeas.
i 'm going to put about three tablespoons maybe slightly, more than three tables to tablespoons oil.
now pens already kind of hot.
so we 're going to go where that giant onion one thing i remember reading once was about how different cultures.
cook , garlic differently and so in italy they like to make sure the garlic is just touched by the heat they do n't like to burn it.
whereas , in indian, cooking a lot you 'll see brown garlic.
maybe i 'll put ginger and the green chili rector.
so why do n't we do that there 's a nice bill by the way, what is this that is full sail amber?
you sound like you 're doing a little spot for them.
this is nice beautiful.
as soon as this is nice beer, damn it.
that 's how they do it.
have reached that point?
like , can i not say this is nice beer without suddenly being seen as a commercial?
she 'll so we 've got so far.
the onion chilies, the ginger, we 're going to put in the two giant cloves of garlic that we dropped and could even put more depending on how much you love garlic.
i actually love garlic, but i 'm not going to make this too crazy.
i think at this point we 're basically ready for the spices, then you could take a quick look at the onion.
and , you know, you 'll see that it is getting pinkish, pinkish light, light brown machine.
i might say i would venture to say it be.
so bold as one could be.
so bold as to say that this is like brown.
so now we 're ready for the master spice with amazon.
this is key.
and of course, the way i 'm going to do it the way i 'm going to do it, is i 'm going to not measure anything?
but i recommend you do n't do this at home.
the right way to do this really is you measure.
and i would say a tablespoon of this powder for each can of chickpeas probably good, so that was one tablespoon.
i 'm gonna go sprinkle.
another tablespoon, right there WO an i 'd say, three tablespoons, i 'm going to one more for good luck that 's a bit i know, i know it seems like a lot.
but there 's logic, please there 's a lot of chickpeas press me alright i think this is ready to go with the tomatoes.
so at this point, you can see this is all the brown spices sort of mixed in there the onions have reduced quite a bit and.
now we put the tomatoes here we go, and honestly with tomatoes.
we really ca n't go wrong, so quick recap onions, you try to get them a little pink.
then you put in ginger and chili peppers.
then you put in a little bit of garlic, and when everything is going to sort of getting pink.
you put in the jenna, masala powder, and when that 's cooked a little bit you gotta cook the masallah, is a little bit?
the spices, and when that 's done, you put in the tomatoes, and you 've got yourself.
basically , you 're essentially done at this point is just going to tomato and everything 's do a little bit, and at the end of that, you can put in the chick peas and then you just let it cook for as long as possible sometimes i just want to mention here like this, right here this is like the basis of a lot of indian dishes if you want to use this as like a base, you can make a lot of vegetables going forward from here it 's right, right alright.
so we get the first canon chick peas in looking beautiful, i 'm really hungry.
yeah , well, this is going to be the beauty, is once you 've added, the beams the piece, it 's going to take very little time.
so we 're going to put a little bit of water because it 's a little.
it needs a little bit of water basically just by looking at it looks a little machine, and it needs, we need a little bit more body recreating something about.
i would say half a cup right, yeah, sorry and now the salt set up, are you talking?
we do n't set up not showing just like naturally just cooking how we normally, yeah, we talk constantly about what we 're doing while they 're cooking.
that 's what i did.
i think part of the charm of what we 're doing right here watching like social, initial that trying to make a cooking show.
yes , i mean, you gotta admit that 's part of what 's funny about this.
maybe that 's what that 's what we should call it like something like search in the shark tried.
make a cooking chip, that is, we 're trying to do frankie.
i had a friend by the way.
yes , i mean, i do n't have anymore, and he contributed two things to my life that i will never forget even something, you get, yes.
the first thing was he would always say to be frankly which i love.
i know forgotten that.
and then the other thing that he did was we 're playing cricket.
and he got out and then like in the next minute, play, many games of cricket same evening.
he came back.
and he caught it with his back, and said, i am back with a vengeance.
i hope we got that one so just to prove that will legit, cokes.
we 've got here all the way from india, the champion of indian, cooking my mom who happens to be visiting me here in LA.
and so what better taste for the food then her so here she comes drum.
roll , let 's go she had brought it on spoon, which is going to sample them jealous of it.
and i have more than two years.
very nice safe for the camera, please, very nice, that is not convincing.
try it again, they 're going to get show some emotion.
so the chick peas are n't actually suck some of them sometimes in some of these cans they end up being really hard and so.
we 're going to do is we 're going to add a little bit of water just a little.
i would say like half a cup, we 're going to mix it around.
i 'm going to mix it around like this, and we 're going to cover it, cover it and went to somewhere between low and medium and leave it there for about i would say another ten minutes we 're going to garnish the channel, masala.
so aesthetic purposes, which consists of just picking up these chopped red onions.
do you want to explain it, even some coriander gotta make this any worse than it is sprinkling it on top which really does n't very nice, i would say then you can just speak a little bit of women?
i think we are all ready to eat ten.
they go beautiful.
perfection you can get good, done at whole foods, and right now, we 've got some trader joes down we 're going to pop into the oven is the stand.
yuri garlic naan.
it 's not really non percent.
but it works so.
we adopted in dead albums like three fifty or whatever to dirty oven right now and just leave it in there for like i do n't know.
three to four minutes check on it.
and then you 'll be ready to go alright.
so here we go this is how you do it hot, and so what you do is you just grab a bite.
you grab some chana, masala, and you stick it in your cake hole.
oh , yeah, how is that is absolutely fantastic?
probably shoot that again without using the word cakehole.
i think it 's great, yeah, yeah, you could also do non hole.
