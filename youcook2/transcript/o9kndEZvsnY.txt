hi , welcome to eighties.
another survival skills, video and today we are going to be cooking boudin noodles.
and we are going to take it up another level.
not just adding soup flavoring, but some cuttlefish balls, an some chinese bok, choy and maybe a little mixed vegetable with it, so, let 's start by showing you.
how we prepare and clean, bok, choy, i like to cut off the ends.
so this way we could easily washing cleanly because all the dirt is in the base of the box, or we could separate it.
i already pre washed.
all of, all of this, so SQL saving time now and let 's move on to sue.
don noodles you can pick up any of these type of food on the rules in just about every grocery store under the sun.
so will just open this up.
and for that, i 'm sorry to say to save time.
i really pretty open.
bible them, and here we go i have already started a pot of water here, and in this part of water i have added a ten of chicken broth.
so i do n't have i do n't have to.
i do n't have to use.
so much of the soup, flavoring that it comes in a package.
but i will add for the sake of flavoring that it 's for this type of noodles i will add about will be couple packs of this, and you see this is.
an will come very close to what you 'll find in a typical japanese restaurant and here where we add in our are fish balls, you could add any other type of meat.
but this comes closer to allow the asian flavoring and will let that ball just a little bit since this could takes a little bit longer to cook let this cook a little bit first before i add in the vegetables.
now like i said, earlier, we do n't have to use back charge weekly just use any clothes and vegetable i know, you know, work just by we had a little bit here however, much that you want to make, i 'm making almost i 'm making five servings here.
so is this comes up to a boil in just a minute i am going to start tune at the boudin noodles and we do n't want to boil the route on noodles too long otherwise, they lose all their texture in the way they 're supposed to be.
so just start adding the who don noodles circle flow this a little bit made it the mono soup that i originally put in there.
so take some of it out absolute this vegetable in there and let that come up to your boy, a little bit ann, we are going to work done.
so you could get some of the noodles start separating him a little bit if you could see the cooking very nicely.
so this dispater noodles be able to survive cost fifty cents a pack on the noodles to as much as eighty cents, a pack the vegetable costs about a dollar, they can including account of chicken broth and that ticket case about a dollar and, and in the fish, balls are about three bucks for the pack and if you do the math, this is i would get some made somewhere under ten bucks, an we 're going to serve what part of noodles that was served by people.
so that 's what you call survival skills save a lot of money bye.
