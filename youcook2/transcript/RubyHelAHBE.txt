one of my favorite dishes and one of the easiest is used to cook is mules, marinir mussels.
and basically all it is, is white wine shallots bay leave time parsley this goes in my butter.
because i finished my move, my near with a butter, which is equal a stick butter and olive oil at the end rather than what most people do is out of cream.
but if we 're honest cream never really delivers it 's more like a, a dirty stock at the end.
so by the time i finish, you 'll see how rich is our delicious, is and how easy it is.
so how we make this is very simple we have our soften butter and this one is chick in touch of taste works, very well, with fish and shellfish in those kitchens.
we used a lot of chicken stock with fish.
dishes say it 's not uncommon in the world of gastronomy.
what it does.
it gives it a great flavor and so check in touch of tastes with fish in my opinion is very good not in all fish dishes.
do you know, i put in my fish pie?
i would it 's really good and then illegal.
you can see we incorporated in.
and what we do n't use is delicious with grilled fish, so you could put in your fridge at the end, was like a source incorporate?
the only ball into the butter little bit by little bit.
so it 's equal quantities and they had about three tablespoons a finely chopped parsley you can make this in advance and put it in your fictional just firm it up or you can make it there and then it 's like a very buttery bible take a little bit of white wine a few shots with a bay leaf sprig of thyme time works very, well, with shellfish.
so in the pan what we have is our shallots, thyme and bay.
i bring it to the boil and reducing a little bit, what we do is remove the alcohol by removing the alcohol.
we start to move the acidity of not just the shots, but of the white wine, when that 's done, will put in our muscles?
and then they 'll cook very.
quickly , with a tip for homers.
even have muscles have a good size pan, and only fill the pan by half.
really , if you try to fill up to the top it 's very hard to turn them barry reducing our white wine, removing the alcohol.
the acidity where concentrating the flavor.
now we put in our muscles, that is going to be in a half kilos would you say and do it by hand rather than just pouring it 'cause otherwise.
i have pulled all the washroom.
you see that starting to open.
so then what we do is we and some of olive oil butter local it 's almost like a broth like a suit when it 's finished and by shaking the pan, you look more supply.
the juices, and then what we do serving dish little your juices over the muscles.
delicious , stipule bread, in afterwards and there.
