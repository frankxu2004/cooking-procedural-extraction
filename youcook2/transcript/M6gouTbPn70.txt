you guys love corn dogs.
but you hate the bad reputation they have, so this is our fancy version.
the moines everlasting memory of a corndog is standing in santa monica beach from getting from hot dog, stand, and we 've got corn dog for the first time 'cause we thought we 'd never had it before loads.
people have told us about them and wants to make it.
and we ate it well.
it was n't brilliant.
it 's salty hotdog in a kind of sweet corn better and that 's what we need today.
but we 're going to give it a spicy twist, have n't got quite such sweet element to it?
this is fifty, fifty clinton plain flour which is pretty standard ratio and egg and buttermilk, combined it is also got baking powder in there and sort bearing in mind that planter is called bill that 's where the corn comes from.
but not enough.
so i 'm not saying we did a fancy one.
so we 've also attended sweet corn is going to go into the blender with handful of jalapeno peppers, sliced chili peppers and a couple spring onions.
pretty good spell.
actually , very, very simple, yeah, but that 's what 's going to make our basic corn dog batter spicy.
so that 's going to go in there.
people said spicy, spicy got the winning vote as dead beef in the choice of hotdogs, pork or beef.
two choices hotdog.
next up we need to better our dogs.
so we have got corn dogs.
batter a couple top tips won, or lost full of your stop, making a glass of your mix.
not that quick.
and keep right and next up.
you take the dog, you want to get all the moisture off your dog, so roll it in cornflower.
and what that would do is it 's over the moisture.
and help me better to stick and then push ace wooden skewer down the centre.
now you got your glass full of liquid.
it 's really easy, that is a subset that is a top, top tip.
make sure is completely covered and then into oil at one hundred eighty degrees.
celsius three or four minutes.
those property could talk about why the hell they called dogs call docs.
i had no idea.
it used to be.
because in germany, they put dog me in the sausages and nobody really knew that they were doing it was that true or just a rumor.
just a wave tales wikipedia.
true , so true enough, i can guarantee.
these are beef, no dog involved as somebody said the ratio the perfect ratio got corn dogs should be eight percent dog twenty percent better and we can sort of occasion just given the role.
so we can make a dip to go with it.
because traditionally called dog might be american mustard.
catch up so that street food is great for that.
we 're going to get different to playoff our sweet corn jalapeno flavors were going to make a mayonnaise with lime juice and fresh coriander, you can test the line into their account indeed and i 'll chop up in coriander.
what i 've really enjoyed about this process of doing these recipes where we 've got you guys, involved is that you helped us create them and actually they 're better for it.
because we 've got influences from all around the world, and what people know, is one corndog is different from what somebody else, then we try to incorporate all of that.
the best called hopefully.
that 's exactly these are now, but if there not if you can get your feedback in.
let 's know down below, how would you have made this even better?

these are now there so they can be fished out.
and onto paper towel.
just to drain off excess grease, then which is self cleaning up this will be our version of a corn dog.
but we want to see what you 've had, had you had something that looks completely different as been served up in a different way?

but for now these are done.
they are spicy corn dogs with coriander and lime mayonnaise sorted mohawk tribe.
and it only works with a dip inches.
well , yeah, but you got it.
i think i 'm going to do now.
that is a type C combo tasty called up, put off kicking it to ask my sensor data and a nice sweetness extra sweet could not just cornmeal.
