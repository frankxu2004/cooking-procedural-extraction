going to make a beef bourguignon.
this is a classic dish which has a fantastic flavor and it 's actually really quite simple to prepare to start.
what we do is take around a kilo, tequila and a half of chuck steak.
pop it into a bowl.
and we marinate it with some red wine and some fresh herbs.
once the meats been marinating for at least two hours we simply scoop the meat out of the marinade and place it on paper towel to pat.
it dry we 're not drawing all the moisture out of the meat was simply removing, the excess marinade.
so that we can sort it and get a nice caramelization on the beef before we braise it.
so into a hot pan put a couple of tablespoons full of oil and then see if you meet in batches.
so that it has a chance to caramelize add a little bit of salt and pepper, while the meeting.
so tang place the rest of you marinade into a warm casserole add some beef stock.
stir in a tablespoon of flour and just bring that up to a gentle simmer.
once the main has a nice caramelization, just add it to the warm stalker and then transfer the dish to the oven.
i 've had the borgen young the oven for around an hour and a half before i take it out.
i 'm going to make a lovely garnish to infuse some fresh flavor into the bourguignon before we serve it all.
we need to do is simply eat some extra virgin olive oil with a little dollop of butter to that.
i 'm going to add some shallots.
some sliced bacon and some mushrooms.
we can sprinkle a little crack pepper on that, but do n't add any salt because the bacon should provide ample.
i 'm now going to take the bourguignon out of the oven.
so i have the beef, bourguignon, which has been in the oven, for around an hour and a half, as you can see there.
it 's really nice and rich and the meat no doubt is starting to fall apart.
i 'm now going to add the crispy bacon with the sweet caramelized onions and mushrooms to the bourguignon along with a dash of cold water stir that through and return the mix to the oven for another twenty minutes, beef bourguignon with bacon mushrooms and onions and served with creamy mashed potato.
