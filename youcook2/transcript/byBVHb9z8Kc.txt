this is my traditional style.
such an hot and sour soup, it has great depth of flavor and it 's a real meal in a bowl.
first of all, i 've got the ginger.
now this is a traditional sort of hot and sour soup.
this is one that my mom would love to make for me, and, you know, what should we do?
is she would vary a little bit, sometimes you had a little bit of leftover like child suros, pork or other ingredients?
so i 've got a good tablespoon there for ginger now.
this is going to give the super lovely warmth so next heat, have got to chili 's here just DC that one next?
i 'm going to put in some wood ear mushrooms so it 's all about texture this dish, and we love the mouth.
feel the cold gun in chinese cooking, so this is a real traditional ingredient, next i 've got her some extra firm tofu.
i just want to slice this into nice long thin strips case.
i 'm just going to slice up the bamboo shoots.
i 've got two cooked chicken breast, just read it.
the stock is summary nicely.
so in, with a ginger and the chili, followed by the chicken breast.
so , just all in basically a good two tablespoons of dark soy source about a tablespoon of shushing rice wine and this is going to add a lovely mellow bittersweetness as it cooks to the soup source about two tablespoons should be enough.
this would not be a hot and sour soup without the sour.
we 've gotta qingjun black rice, vinegar about a tablespoon of this, this is T engine preserved.
cabbage leaves different.
been preserved in like chili and salt.
so you need to just rinse them off.
but they provide the sort of intense savory sour note to any dishes.
really that 's very, very nearly ready.
it 's coming to the boil, so it 's very, very quick.
so at this stage i 'm just going to carefully add in my soft tofu strips.
careful not to break up the tofu.
so i just want one beat neck during the egg, then add the blended corn flour and stir to thicken the soup came to add in chili.
oil ca n't wait for the boys to taste this, so this is my traditional style set ran hot and sour.
