i believe in taking risks in life.
that 's why i 'm wearing white to make spaghetti and meatballs.
now you could spend all day making sauce.
or you could do it my quick and easy way and make the sauce and spaghetti and meatballs.
all in thirty five minutes and here 's how we 're going to start by preparing some soft, fresh bread crumbs for the meatballs.
so i have two slices of my homemade whole wheat bread, which is soft.
you can use white bread or isoft whole way, but it has to be soft like this, so we 're going to put that in a food processor.
and we 're going to process what they call fresh bread.
crumbs do not use dried bread comforts that has to be fresh bread crumbs, so, what process it for about ten seconds and that 's how you make fresh bread crumbs.
so it 's about three quarters of a cup of crumbs and two slices like that will do it.
so we put those crumbs into a bowl.
OK , put this back and to the bread crumbs, we 're going to add a third cup of milk now.
i 'm using one percent milk.
you can use whole milk if you want.
but i just use it to keep the calories down.
so i 'm going to stir it up just a little bit with a fork, kind of get it all in there.
and , while that absorbs this milk, while the bread absorbs the milk.
we 're going to go on and make the sauce now.
what i do is i like to have a smooth sauce.
i 'm going to use the same food processor.
if you do n't have a food processor, you can cut the bread into tiny little pieces and do the same thing.
and you can puree the tomatoes in a blender, but i 'm going to use the same food processor.
i 'm using twenty eight, twenty eight ounce can of plum tomatoes they make the best tasting sauce.
i like it kind of smooths.
i 'm going to puree the tomatoes first right that 's been maybe twenty seconds.
and i think that 's good to go right so i started my burner going now let me just tell you about the or my pot going let me tell you about the pot you do need a pot that 's at least seven inches across the bottom so measure the bottom of your pot it has to be seven inches across because you have to fit all the meatballs in there in one layer so alright.
so now we 're going to make the sauce while the breadcrumb soak and we 're going to saute one clove of garlic, which i have in here.
see that already pressed it in a tablespoon of olive oil, so i 'm going to put the olive oil in here.
all approximates just sauce, you know, but a tablespoon.
but the reason that you want to use a generous amount of oil is because the oil helps the lycopene in tomatoes.
absorb better into your system it 's a good cancer protector.
OK , see the garlic is kind of gold.
now that 's the perfect time to add the tomato, so there it 's been about maybe one full minute.
now we 're going to add the tomatoes OK alright so that 's it tomatoes are in now we 're going to add a few more ingredients and let this cook here 's what we 're going to add we 're adding a half here this right here it 's a half teaspoon of italian spice like a combination of italian seasoning so half teaspoon two teaspoons of.
sugar , a quarter teaspoon of salt they 're going to go in here.
and some fresh pepper to taste and, well, you gotta do the fresh pepper OK alright will screw that up.
it still bubbling.
so we 're just going to let it cook away here, and we 're going to add some fresh basil.
but we 're not going to do it till the very last minute at fresh basil.
so will turn it down just a little.
let it simmer over here while we put together the meatballs now.
we have the three quarters of a cup of soft fresh breadcrumbs.
they 've soaked in all that nice milk.
now we 're going to add all of these ingredients here.
first of all, it 's an egg one, it gets added.
and then here 's all the rest of the stuff very easy.
it 's a tablespoon of fresh parsley, a tablespoon of parmesan tablespoon, each, it 's a half teaspoon of italian spice, the same one that went into the sauce, a clove of garlic and a quarter.
teaspoon of salt and, of course, some fresh pepper to taste alright.
so that 's all the flavoring for the meatballs were going to you have to stir this before you add the meat.
because it 's much better as much better way to incorporate all these flavors and everything.
so it 's mixed in evenly.
so there that 's it now, we 're going to add a three quarters of a pound of ground, beef, and here it is right here that goes in simple.
now we 're going to make some meatballs.
now i 'd like to use gloves, but, oh, i forgot my gloves again.
i do n't know how that happens every time.
i make a video.
i forget my gloves anybody, anybody.
thank you, thank you.
OK , you can do this by hand.
i do it because i do n't want to keep soaking my hands in water and running them out, but this easier.
now we 're going to combine all this sauce is bubbling nicely going to combine all this, you have to do it by hand and do n't over.
do it, you just kind of fold underneath, and like that, and kind of squeeze it until you see it?
that 's fairly well incorporated going to show you my trick for this, this, uh, this recipe serves four people.
two meatballs each.
so we 're going to be making eight meatballs.
here 's my little trick.
you take the mixture once it 's all mixed up like that.
it looks pretty good and in the bowl.
i kind of divide it in half like this, and then i divide it in half again.
it 's not perfect, but it gives you a rough idea of how much you can use in each one.
so each one of these section is going to meatballs so you just pick the meatballs.
and these are about two inches across and what i do is, i put the meatballs on a plate or something.
and i want to dump them all in the sauce at the same time, so there 's one.
but a two inch two inches.
so you shape all the meatballs first and then we 're going to drop them into the sauce and the there 's two reasons why these meatballs are.
so soft one is.
because we 're using a fresh bread crumbs and not dried and the other, is 'cause they 're going to cook in the sauce and that just makes them taste better and makes them super supersoft?
so let me finish up these ate meatballs in with a woman sauce.
OK last meatball.
here , it is did n't take very long now.
here 's my eight meatballs.
as you can see there are not perfect.
but i consider me falls like people, they 're not all perfect.
so , but they 're close enough in shape.
so now we 're going to drop them.
i give the sauce of ulster here.
and we drop them into the sauce and that 's it now.
that 's why you need that seven inch saucepan to make sure that these get all underneath.
the sauce, and then the sauce level is going to come up as the feet balls.
go into there 's one two three kind of gently for five six seven eight OK.
now if they 're not completely covered you can just kind of tap them a little bit.
now , this cooks for twenty minutes, and while those are that 's it.
we 're just going to add the basil at the end, while that 's cooking we make the spaghetti.
and we 're done less than thirty five minutes so the meatballs been cooking now for about ten minutes.
the water is boarding time to cook the spaghetti now.
the package says two ounces per person what if your five three ounces just for me alright the sauce is done look just look at this.
the meatballs are done the sauce is done.
it 's nice and thick look at that here.
there 's one more thing to do, though, and this is really important.
you have to add at least two tablespoons of fresh basil.
you just kind of slice it into little strips or pieces.
it does n't even matter.
but this smells amazing, you just this is so key.
i think that 's about two tablespoons.
fresh basil is key.
there 's nothing like this.
smell , but you have to do it.
last minute cook too much, so will stir in the basel, oh, smells amazing.
you , gotta, come over, OK, that 's it.
you just threw that in fresh, the spaghetti is done turn that off we 're going to drain the spaghetti alright.
i 'll put it back in here.
and the best way i find is to store a little sauce into the spaghetti first.
so it has read all through it just a little bit of sauce like that and tongs are a good way to kind of stir sauce into it.
so it 's all covered in red.
so there 's my three ounce.
serving not that much come on now to serve it.
you got your spaghetti.
you put your two meatballs on top.
a little more sauce with that amazing basil, look at that OK now.
of course, if you like me, there 's still one more thing to do a little bit of fresh parmesan will a fresh parm, oh, my god spaghetti and meatballs is just the best thing in the world alright.
so now there is a proper way to eat spaghetti supposed to use a spoon and a fork and you go in, and you kind of use the spoon.
and you twirl like that to get a nice little one bite right like that, which is fine.
if you 're dining with the royal family.
but then, there 's my way on my way.
is you take the fork?
and you just twirl and twirl N twirl and shove it in it 's a time saver awesome.
there are a lot of fancy ways to make garlic bread.
but i like to keep it simple a good loaf of bread lots of fresh garlic and a simple, easy recipe, and this one is really, really easy, pizza is really about the crust is n't it especially pan pizza.
so how would you like to make the most amazing pan pizza and the easiest.
no needing no work, and you get this beautiful, golden crispy crust.
