i 'm julia moskin, today.
we 're making simple mashed potatoes.
you can, goldran, russets have the best consistency for making a good fluffy mash here, we 're using a mix of both to start peel the potatoes.
while you bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat when the water is boiling add the potatoes.
let them cook for about fifteen to twenty minutes.
in the meantime, melted butter and warm the milk that will be added to the potatoes for mashing you can do this in one sauce pan.
now check on the potatoes.
they are done cooking when easily pierced.
do not under cook them, drain potatoes and return them to the pop?
this will help dry them out, begin to mash the potatoes.
this is a basic measure.
if you like you can use a reiser, which gives a fluffier consistency for whipped potatoes, use a hand or stand mixer as you mash pour in the butter and milk mixture when you reach the consistency.
you like taste and add the salt and pepper if necessary.
mashed potatoes can take a lot of salt.
so , do n't hold back keep the potatoes hot until ready to serve all?
