hello , no mistake.
welcome to my home kitchen.
and today i 'm making garlic butter.
not this fast and easy, making garlic butter, naan will be a big hit for sure on your dinner table, and it is going to be instant wars, and here i have a plane floor.
you can use wheat flour.
i usually use chapati atta.
but today, i 'm making with the mix of chapati atta, and plain flour.
so , wheat flour in all purpose floor so the first thing i 'm going to do is preparing the goal for non now.
i usually like to take white, both when i prepare this, though.
so i 'm going to take all this floor into this boat here add some salt garlic powder roughly chopped coriander, leaves danya.
this is optional.
if you like you can have otherwise just give it out now.
mix it well, all right now in the centre make well, so make some space and here i have active dry yeast and this is instant.
yeast takes only ten minutes.
so get all the east in a central sugar, sugar helps to activate yeast very well.
so always admiral sugar when you making any kind of formatting dough.
how are you?
and let it stand the east for about five minutes on to get frothy.
now i 'm making garlic butter.
so here i have some melted butter.
and i 'm taking yogurt.
usually , people add egg so you can add one egg or just take yogurt plain yogurt.
let 's check on our east, open it up.
you can see that east has become the mixture, looks brought email so the yeast is activated nicely now to this.
i 'm going to add yogurt, melted butter.
and here i have some more regular water to need this dope very, well.
so mix everything very well, first, can.
now get the flower in and.
so this is mixed?
very low now take little water at a time and need softap, dope alright, so this soft dope is ready.
make sure to need very, well, do it?
get this mood like this now take little oil spread into the bowl.
this like this and put the goal in the middle right so this door looks good.
now is pretty quick.
now cover it and let it rise for about ten, fifteen minutes.
let 's check on our, though it 's been resting for about ten, fifteen minutes, now.
let 's open it up.
and you can see that it has reason double in size now, now you can roll it for stretched out door.
it 's really up to you, but i always roll my, so this is my rolling board.
and what i normally do i make big, not so, i 'm using these pizza trade.
now by this time you can also turn on your R, one, two four hundred and fifty degrees.
fahrenheit between four hundred to five hundred anywhere and make sure that your door is not hard.
but wary solved, you can see that though, is varisoft.
but it 's not sticky at all now.
so i 'm going to take the week make smooth ball, glad, and out sprinkled some dry floor.
or you can just stretch like this.
it 's really up to you.
i 'm done rolling now in onto this tray again.
sprinkle some drive flower.
and i 'm going to transfer this on to these tree, you can stretch it out again.
and you can see that i have rollout thing, not too thick and not.
do things like this here, i have some minced garlic chopped very fine?
top it up again with more garlic just breakdown.
now even though i added, garlic powder in my door i again top this rolled non with more garlic in this time.
i 'm going to use minced garlic formal favor.
now one more step, this is totally optional if you have time, then you can follow this step otherwise.
just you can make this non right away.
this non is ready to go into the oven.
but ford i normally do if i have a time, then i again let this whole world non let it rise again.
so when you bake it comes out nice, fluffy, soft.
so i 'm going to cover it, and i 'll be ready to bake in about ten, fifteen minutes again instead of making small individual non.
you can make the big none, and then cut them just like you cut pizza and give them the triangle pieces of naan, and it looks great.
even so this way it 's faster, japanese ready preheated oven at four hundred fifty degrees.
fahrenheit , this tray is also ready to go into the omen and i 'm not sure whether you can notice.
but it has reason again little bit even after rolling.
so , if you keep it for about ten, fifteen minutes again then it will rise a little bit again.
and now this is ready to go into the oven.
let 's check on our butter.
this looks great.
nice golden brown cover.
because this is what are garlic, naan more butter on top and.
now we can cut and.
so sprinkled some more cilantro, veneer on top before getting up to your guests, in here.
i have the another non ready without any garlic on top because one of my son does n't like any kind of things on top.
so this is just a simple, and look at inside.
looks so spongy anything.
so , this non you can just eat itself, because it 's so flavorful.
you can just turn it as it is.
you do see where you saw students and the little crispy outside and soft inside that 's the great texture of non in my mouth is watering.
i 'm going to take the just a little.
he 's here just the middle right here.
look at that, so great.
i can tell you how to try it, it 's very easy now, if you 're not using yeast, you can use baking powder or baking soda.
but when you use a yeast every i have noticed that the non or pizza crust or anything that you making comes out real nice soft let me show you even the inside of this non look at this looks.
so spongy , soft.
so this was all about garlic butter naan.
thank you for watching and i 'll see you soon with the next great recipe.
