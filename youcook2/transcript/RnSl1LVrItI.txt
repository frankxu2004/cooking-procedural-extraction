so here i have a cups of water, and we 're going to go ahead and put the rips in the pots and wait for it to boil.
OK , so now let 's get the vegetable ready.
first , we call gonna pound the shallots to release its flavor, a compound.
it hot like i did last match to think next.
you 're going to also pounds the chili peppers, and then make a slip cut in the middle and put it aside, OK the lemongrass.
the part where you cut in, like about two inch or three inch slice thick.
now you can slice it in half.
and then you cannot pound it, but do n't use the back of the knife like i did.
it 's very dangerous.
you can use any archers, but, you know, heavy choose to pound it OK and the rest i 'm going to thinly sliced them and put aside and with the galangal.
it 's very strong flavor, you do n't have to use too many.
i only use force lights in the soup today very, very strong flavor OK now the water is boiling so.
go back to the plot and scheme out of junk on the suit.
make sure you keep doing this until the water.
get clear and the formic, unk have a little while she color in it.
that means that the most of the dirty gunk already come out.
you just gotta go ahead an lower the heat down, too.
hello , and then after you load the heat down, you gonna add in the rest of the ingredients, which is the shallops, the lemongrass and the hot chili pepper.
if you want to, if you like the flavor of lemongrass, you can use more than one start.
and if you like more spicy, you can add tried chili whole factors in.
also , you like now, cope with the lid and let it simmer and cook for about thirty, thirty minutes.
OK , it 's been thirty minutes.
let 's see, how they doing perfect.
it looked like the risks is tender now.
so this is a good sam.
where we 're going to add the rest of the lemongrass and the seasoning.
i do n't want to add the lemongrass.
it 's going to make it more fresher the flavor of the lemongrass, and then you can add in the fish sauce if you, like last week cannot add more sugar.
but here, i have only three tablespoon of sugar is perfectly for the part that i cook today, would a cup of water , so?
and finally the chicken powder like i say, if you want more sweet more salty, just add a little more fish sauce and sugar only, and he is the hot chili pepper crushed or flex as a lot of people call it, you can add more if you like more spiciness.
but i think this is good amount of spikes for this week , OK.
and right now this is the good sample.
you just to chase a little bit of it.
so this is the final step in cooking the soup.
we 're going to put out a vegetable in, yeah, i have cabbage and again you can use beansprout or carriage or mushroom or any vegetable.
OK , look at about two or three more minutes or until.
it 's a little bit tender, not too, too tender like it stay crunchy and.
now we 're going to prepare the herbs when i cut the call aunt rose in little slice.
but thinly slice put it aside, and with the line, we can start to go ahead and cut the line in half.
or you can cut in little pieces if you want.
i just want to prepare the choose ahead of time.
so i do n't have to squeeze it in every time i needed.
OK , see this, this is my lime juice.
and it 's very cute.
i use it a lot.
it got a lot of chew stuff on line and before we begin i 'd like to tell show you how to pick a good line.
you want to pick the one with the chinese game.
you see that how shiny and thin it is.
we 've got a lot to choose from it.
you do n't want the one that 's dry, and i kinda funky OK such a squeeze, it all out OK, after we finish you can get a side in a bowl for later serving like.
i said you can cut lining which is if you like this, which is more convenient OK.
so now we 're gonna get ready to scoop out the meat and ready to eat now, what the line add as much as you like.
it depends how sour you wanted it supposed to be sweet, sour and little bit salty.
