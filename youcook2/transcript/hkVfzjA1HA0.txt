so for this recipe, what you 're going to do is you 're going to make smooth cuts of salmon and tuna.

so just drag your knife through it if your knife is n't sharp enough to do it then you can shop in it.

so just a couple of cuts we need of each some of salman, and i told her now.
here the, the piece of tuner is extruding a little bit.
so what i 'm going to do one will cut just to make it, or even, and this can be used for that.
all data do n't worry about it.
no nothing goes to waste here.
and he just wanted to be reason to be thin, not too thin because they are going to go around like a roll.

and you press the rice a little bit deeper.
and now to keep it all together.
a very thin strip of nori seaweed paper make it thin.
they 'll make it too big can just wrap around.
