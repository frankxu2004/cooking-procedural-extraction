what do what you want, but do what you want?
so let 's get started first thing you want to do is start on your caesar salad dressing.
and the first thing i want to put into the bowl is two egg yolks know why it 's just the yolks.
OK , so separate your eggs, keep the yolks next.
i want to put in some fresh minced garlic to straight in to the egg yolks next.
i want to put in some dijon mustard.
this gives a caesar salad are really nice kick right at the end, and of course, i 'm going to put in some anchovies now.
i 'm using anchovy paste if you want to use real anchovies.
i just find i get a better flavor from the paste and of course, i 'm going to add in some red wine vinegar, and this just helps.
addressing it gives it a real nice tartness now.
this is very important.
make sure you mix this part.
well , because we 're going to be doing is we 're going to be adding olive oil to this dressing now.
if you do n't do this right, the dressing is going to split.
OK , so what you want to do whisking all the time very quickly do n't stop in an S shape.
i want you to slowly add the olive oil until there is none left.
do not stop whisking once?
the oil has run out season.
it salt N pepper, and it should be nice and creamy, just like this.
if you have a multiplied that olive oil and the egg properly like you see here it will be this beautiful, thick pale, white creamy source, just like you see on the screen if it splits, there 's you ca n't save it you 'll have to start again never there caesar dressing is finished, put it aside, and we 're going to start on our croutons.
now get a nice crusty bread and something like a sourdough or something like that, nice and crusty and nice and soft god.
because we 're going to be to sing these in the oven.
so just cut them up into fairly good size pieces.
you do n't too small.
arrange them on a baking tray lined with baking paper.
i 'm going to dress them with some olive oil.
now you want to put these into the oven only for about fifteen minutes is about one hundred ninety degrees.
C until they 're nice and golden brown, the.
next thing i want to do is fry off our bacon until it 's nice and crispy.
so into a hot pan.
because we 've already got that fed on the bacon, and that will reduce down cook this until it 's nice and crispy.
now ever calendar, i 'm just washing our cause lettuce leaves.
now you can use other letters if you wanted to like an iceberg or something like that.
but cause letters is traditionally served with a caesar salad, and.
so that 's what i 'm using here today.
so just watch it will make sure all the sounds after my bacons fried, i 'm just draining the excess oil with some paper towel, and i 'm cutting that bacon into about the same places as the croutons not too small.
but not too large either.
now it 's time to play it up the first thing, you want to do is arrange that cause let us beautifully on the bottom there, just like that.
because we 're going to be putting all those ingredients almost like a shell into that letters, adding the croutons.
now look at them they 're beautiful.
indulge brown, lovely, untoasted, nice soft centers.
that 's what you 're after which means i 'm adding the falcon and that salty bacon just go.
so , well, with it and of course we 're going to add over our dressing that we 've made and have a look at that.
it is absolutely.
beautiful , but it 's not finished, yet we 're going to.
of course, finish this off with some freshly shaved parmesan cheese and have a look at that absolutely beautiful.
the perfect accompaniment to any lunch absolutely beautiful, now my mom is actually trying this.
as we speak, do n't think mineable gone wrinkling like his joking anyway?
guys if you want to make this, all the ingredients are below make sure you give this a try it 's absolutely fantastic.
it 's dead, easy, you 'll never ever go to another cafe again to make it because you 'll do it at home.
