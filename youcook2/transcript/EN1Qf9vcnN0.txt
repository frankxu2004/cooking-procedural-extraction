in this video, i 'm going to share how i make flatbread or also known as not the ingredients that you need are three cups of flour.
one teaspoon of salt or to taste three tablespoons of unsalted melted butter.
one teaspoon of baking powder.
one tablespoon of yeast, half a teaspoon of sugar, one fourth of a cup of warm water about one cup of warm water and some oil.
the first step is to add the sugar to the east and add the one fourth cup of warm water mix.
it well, and let the yeast rise for about ten minutes after ten minutes this is what your yeast should look like it should be very foamy and have risen a lot next.
add the baking powder to the flour as well as the salt, the yeast and the butter as well as about half a cup of water warm water that is and then just give that a quick mix and add the remaining half a cup of warm water.
you may need more or less, depending on the kind of flower that you 're using.
but for me one cup was exactly the right amount.
and then i 'm just mixing that with the spoon.
but at some point we 'll have to use your hands and need the door for about three to five minutes.
the consistency of the dose should be sticky, that is, what is going to make them really nice and airy?
you do n't want your dough to be too tough.
so , if the dough is sticky and moist and that 's a good thing if it 's not sticky enough, then you should add a little bit of water and.
next just add a little bit of oil on top and just spread that all over you 're going to have to let this rise for a few hours and the oil is going to prevent it from forming a crust.
and as you can see that there was really nice and soft.
so then just cover that with anything that you have i just use some foil and let it rise for about two to four hours.
the longer you let it rise the better the door will be.
next preheat, a pan and make sure that the temperature is on low to medium heat and then this is what the dough looks like after it has prison mine, rose for about two and a half hours.
but like i said, the longer the butter can let it rise up to four hours and will be good.
and then just take some oil and rub it on your hands.
so that it 's not sticky, take the desired amount of dough depending on how large you want your flat bread to be, and i 'm actually not going to be needing that deal again.
i 'm just going to be leaving it as is, and just taking a little bit of dough as i go along.
so , then just take a plate or any flat surface, and then just spread out the dough with flatbread form make sure that you do not make it too thin.
otherwise , you will have a crunchy flatbread and then just really quickly.
throw it on the pan.
an if it stretches out, too much you can gather it together and let that cook for about two minutes on the first side until you start seeing the top cooking from within and when the bottom also gets nice dark brown spots, and then on the second side.
cook it for about one more minute.
and i know this is not the most perfectly shaped flat bread.
but it 's homemade.
so it 's OK, and this is where it should look like, and then just repeat the same process.
just put some oil on the surface.
you 're working on but the dough on top you can put a little bit more.
if you want to and then just flatten it out into a circle again making sure it 's not too thin.
because if sticker it will be nicer and softer and then again really quickly just throw it on the pan gather it back together if it stretches out too much and as you can see over here.
where is the dell and there 's word has dried up and cooked from within a little bit?
so , while the bottom is cooking the top will start drawing up and that 's when you can tell that you 're ready to flip it as well as when the bottom is getting, nice dark brown spots.
so it took about two minutes for the first side and one minute for the second side, and that one is ready as well.
so these are the finish flatbreads i got about eight of them from this recipe and as you can see there really soft and very delicious and very chewy for extra softness, which is how we like it in my family i cover it with foil and let it stay for about ten minutes and the steam and the heat of the flat bread will actually make the rest of the bread really nice and soft and that is it the spread came out really delicious.
and it made the whole house smell like delicious homemade bread.
it was so good.
