hi , you too.
but your girl love kisses ninety nine, and i 'm coming to you today with my second recipe of the day and this is a recipe for macaroni and cheese.
this is going to make a large pan of macaroni and cheese so it 's from more than two or three people.
it 's kind of like for one of those affairs.
you go to any app to take a dish.
so just stay tuned.
OK , OK, so now i have the macaroni.
that 's already been drained, and i 'm going to put in three tablespoons of butter, see this over here.
and i 'm going to start the butter.
in you can use margarine you can use some country crock.
whichever , you know, is your favorite you can?
most certainly use that some guests turn this in.
and it 's going to melt because the macaroni is still hot and now i 'm going to take a jar cheese.
and i 'm going to put this in.
and this is going to melt as well.
because the macaroni like i said, it 's still hot and this recipe it might be too much cheese for you.
but this is the way my sons like it so, this is kind of.
the only way that i make it some just starring in that cheese.
whiz , so mixing this is going to take me a minute.
so i 'm going to mix it all together, and i 'll be right back and show you the rest of the process.
so the cheeses.
although cheese whiz is all incorporated.
so now i 'm going to take regular milk.
and i 'm going to pour this in and sturgis ten, as well.
and now we 're just going to assemble.
are macaroni and cheese just going so?
i have two cups of mild cheddar, an i have four cups of sharp cheddar, the reason that i use it in, you know, like that is.
because there 's already mild cheese in it.
so we want to give it just a little bit of a bite with the sharp cheese.
so this is how big layering.
but of course, the macaroni, in spread, it around a little bit and i 'm going to spring mild cheese.
this is a really cheesy recipe and this way they 'll be cheesed around.
and i 'm going to take quite a bit of the sharp on the ground layer that on top as well, spread that around add some more.
the macaroni, and it 's just the same process.
brenda macaroni, around and then we 're going to use more cheese and we just keep away, away until your whole finished seems like my sons like actually more cheese than macaroni in their macaroni and cheese and then i 'm just going to put the rest of the macaroni right on the top and you might have the mash it down a little bit 'cause it is going to be a full pan and make sure when you put it in the oven that you put it on maybe a cookie sheet.
so that way if there 's any trips or anything you wo n't have to worry about having to clean your stove once you 're done, and i 'm going to put this aside.
now we 're going to add the rest of the cheese right on top.
display them of eggs to have a nice crust on the top from the cheese.
so what i 'm going to do is put this in the oven on three fifty to three seventy five for approximately forty five minutes with the foil on.
after the forty five minutes are up.
i 'm going to take the foil off and just let it cook on the top so that it gets a nice even browning on the top.
and you can even put it like right under your broiler, but watch that closely because the boiler has a tendency to work really fast.
and it will burn your food.
if you ever, you 're not watching closely so i 'm going to drop this in the oven, and i 'll be back to show you the end result.
OK , i 'm here.
we have dinner all done.
we have the red beans and rice.
we have some collard greens here.
the macaroni and cheese and some baked chicken.
so , i 'm really hoping you enjoy your dinner and hoping you have a good day today, and i 'll see you again soon.
