hi , i 'm at galinsky, and i 'm going to show you how to be a lunchtime legend with my champagne leg hair.
proper sure this is a favorite in all the paris cafes, and i 'm sure it 's going to be a favorite at your place, too.
i 'm just going to slice six big slices of baguette that one centimeter thick, and lay those out on a baking tray, and i 'll spread that they get slices with some vegetable source, which is just a simple white source made with milk butter.
this is champagne ham from the door.
sonia deli fresh range sold exclusively more worse, take out a couple of slices and what you do n't use.
you can just re fold the clothes back up with this digger to keep it.
nice and fresh fits in your fridge beautifully.
and it uses less plastic as well, and have a look at these break large deli style slices just like you get a deli counter, i 'm pudding.
one slice on half that they gets and on the other hobbs, a good sprinkle of the cheddar cheese, and then i 'm just going to pop the cheesy one on top of the hair and pop goes into a preheated two hundred degree oven for around about ten minutes until they 're nice and golden , there.
jesus , all melted OK.
they should be ready now that eh wala, lacrosse, machera it 's the french version of the ham and cheese toastie.
so this up, and i guarantee you 'll be a lunchtime legend to print out this recipe and to see my other deli.
