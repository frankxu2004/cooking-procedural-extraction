hey , any harm shift, home.
i had a special request from one of my facebook friends.
picking soup, an i got summer ingredient, which is the drive with your mushroom bamboo, shoot regular button mushroom.
green onion, i got some grilled chicken already.
cook , i just going to cut it like this, like a little strip, or you can use ground chicken or any kind of chicken that you have that 's fine, and we had this tofu five ounces of tofu media firm, and i want to introduce a new ingredient that i have n't cooked yet, which is the dry lilies.
flowers yep is a dry.
lily is a lily flowers.
but in asian cooking for lots of like making stew stir fry and what i did is soak into like warm water for maybe just five minutes, and supposed to be dry.
but now, after you soak it is nice and soft, an them only flower dry, have lots of help benefit for you is good for like vitamin C and B one and B, two, plus others.
so anyway, i 'm going to show you how to cook it, and i got one bit, and eight two.
so , first i 'm going to cut the tofu going to cut the little strip hopeful.
maybe like a quarter inch, slides.
this is the medium firm tofu.
or you can use firm, or saw when you cook with salt.
awful , you, gotta, be careful because they break down very easily.
so i like medium firm.
and i just gonna cut like maybe quarter inch that 's true here we go.
and i 'm gonna show, you.
how to cook it.
here 's my deep frying pan.
OK , i 'm going to ask some vegetable cooking oil.
just a little bit like this, i 'm going to add.
ginger , ginger is really good for making soup and a black bean paste.
if you do n't have bright green pace, you can do it out.
it 's OK, and you can use any kind of a hot chili paste or hot chili flake or hot chili oil.
this detail, the spiciness and get them a quick stir.
we 're going to infuse the oil to make a sumo flavor that 's good enough.
and then the next, i 'm going to add all my would you mushroom and the regular micron and the chicken vendor shoe.
also , the driver lee, yeah, oh, in from a quick search now so good would be great, flavor alright.
we do n't have to search too long.
one minute do not, i 'm using this organic vegetable stack that i had some leftover.
there 's four cups at the end very simple to make a home here we go.
and we 're going to, uh, cover up.
we do n't have to add any seasoning yet until the sauce bring up to a boil.
OK , see you later soup.
it 's up to a boil.
their agenda heat down to medium.
now we 're going to add some soy sauce.
i like to try out maybe couple teaspoon first and depend how salty yo soy sauce is.
and then you 're going to give.
them , a try it 's good, maybe one more OK i do n't eat too salty.
so i put three TSP and then the vinegar.
i like to use the white vinegar, stronger acidity, one two three, three TSP.
we stare live it, you see, the temperature control is great.
still , bobbling still cooking and give him a quick try perfect for me.
if you like most hour and more white vinegar, and i always tried to pinch some black pepper or white pepper.
just a pinch like that give him a different kind of flavor right and.
now after we flavor the soup that we can add our tofu in like that tofu does n't require a lot of time to cook and.
now i can cram back up the temperature, too high.
and the next step i got some corn starch mix.
i got two tablespoons cornstarch with three ounces water.
and we 're going to think of the soup before we take a nap to suit.
we want to make sure the soup bring up to a boil.
now , the soup bring up to a boil, where you going to pick up the soup by adding the construction makes little bit at a time, getting thicker.
or you can use potato starch, potato starch is stronger than the cornstarch for ticket just a little more.
that 's perfect yes.
after that we 're going to end up beaten egg.
you want to make sure your soup is taken before you add the beaten egg and otherwise the egg when you pull into the soup without taking it just flying around everywhere.
you see how beautiful there is now knives and the end.
sesame E oil, just like that.
the flavors good.
the thickness of the soup is great here we go ready to serve here show picking.
soup , usually like a hot and sour soup, they like to use hot chili oil.
so if we have like a homing hot chili oil or you can drizzle on the top it look really yummy you feel like more spicy just eat more, has stars?
i 'm chef tom.
i hope you like the video and see you next time.
