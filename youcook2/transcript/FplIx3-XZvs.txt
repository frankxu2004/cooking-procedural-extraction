that 's where i like that little picture of you with acute, you who did n't caroline graphic carol, she knows what she 's doing, right welcome back.
if parma is famous for one thing.
it 's pro, geason were featuring behind the scenes shaft from our fox eight staff all week long, and today.
one of our all time favourites production assisted elicia in gary 's here to show us how to make three different kinds of perrot guy 's using a recipe passed down from her mom and grandmother and elise is kind of new to the fox eight family.
but love do n't you want to know the history.
because i know, you had a different look about you, obviously she scored single.
but your ukrainian i did n't know that i 'm ukrainian on my mom side, and hungarian, on my dad 's and my mom actually was born, in germany came here to ellis island when she was three we came to cleveland.
because my grand father got a job as a bricklayer.
so that 's where we got our start and i 've grown up in parma ever since graduated from the university of toledo, and i 'm back home here.
so of working here watch this channel, my entire life.
so he 's going crazy when you watch something, your entire life, and then all the sudden you work fairly really a real this video of you working.
so tell everybody which you actually do, well, i 'm not production, assistant and i sit at the assignment desk as you can see i 'm answering calls, an viewers calling give us a lot of tips.
so thank you for those i listen to over dozens of scanners to help find anything newsworthy look up stories i 'll go out on interviews and i also do the missing person project is huge.
and i just want to thank all the people who send in photos of their loved ones and family and friends and the police who really helped me to get those photos and help get those faces out there.
so whenever you talk to someone named at least that 's me working with that project.
now everybody will be calling you 're going to need like an assistant alright.
do you have for us to, i know, you have, perrot guy 's.
but there 's all kinds out there.
but this is a basic one that you want to make i make why make three kinds today, we 're just going to be making the potato and i make it shatter.
so call cheddar the other ones you can use potato with onion and everybody loves pro guy 's i have n't really met anyone who does n't like them and some people buy them.
but they really are n't that hard to make actually the ingredients are you 're going to use two cups of flour and you 're going to use a half a cup of sour cream yeah, i was by the frozen ones, you know, in the freezer at the grocery store homemade is always butter, i do n't want it does n't take very long to butter, you want reese this right, you can, you can just use those zip lock freezer bags with them right in your freezer warm them up and put him right on the stove with some butter and onions.
so this is your dough you want to need it together, and when you do that, it 's going to look like this, and what helps is, when it 's cold is easier to work with.
so you can put this once you need the dough together this you can put it in a plastic bag and involved and then you could put that in your refrigerator for twenty minutes, you can also leave it there for the.
next day if you want to make it the.
next day, but fresh is always better.
so if you want to appointment to make extra, you know, instead of doing this whole thing again.
so this recipe makes a dozen nice and the recipe will also be on line.
so you 're also going to you 're going to roll out the dough and what 's easy is when i show you, you can use any kind of glass and make your shape.
so at one side is going to be more sticky, and that 's the side that you want to use to put the filling in?
and like i said, today we have potato, which we 're going to put you to work christy, we have potato.
i 'll show you how to do one, and basically you just make your mashed potatoes you boil.
the potatoes peel them, can you buy the instant potatoes?
no , sorry, your mother would not be with me right now, right now she 's like really christy.
i 'm kidding bomb, so you want to fill it, and then you turn it over like this, and i do like to use right now.
i have little kids, forks, so i want to thank my nephews maximum alex.
hello , at home, therefore, it works so well.
actually love these perot, geese two and it 's a great transition for little kids and moms.
temaiken kids can actually help make these you could tell my pinch, the sides.
and it 's good for them because it 's dolan potato, so when kendall gets a little older, i can stop over and help make these private stuff.
two weeks so you could help that out.
so once you make these you want to put them right into the boiling water nice now, i think, i just made an extra potato one.
but you have other ones that you 're going to make right, the one with cheese or, do you put that interested in making the potato once today if you want to make the cheese ones what you do is you make your potatoes and you could put the cheese with them and mix it together same thing goes for the onions and you can use chopped onions like that.
super easy how long in the boiling water, literally a couple minutes.
but another way, you can do it is when they float to the top there done.
that 's not hard at all couple minutes.
why are you buying freezer point now?
i 'm going to try this weekend with the holidays coming around.
that 's perfect right.
