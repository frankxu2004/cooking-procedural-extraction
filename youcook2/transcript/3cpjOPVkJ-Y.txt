hey , dad, i 'm hilah anne, today on hilah cooking.
we are making minestrone soup.
there is a lot of different ways to do it.
i 'm going to show you the way i like to make it, but anyway, you cut it, it 's got a lot of vegetables.
it 's got pasta, it 's got beans.
so it 's really, really healthy and really filling and it 's going to be great for all of your cool weather meal needs.
so let 's do it.
first , we are going to saute your vegetables.
i 'm using onion celery carrots and green beans.
a lot of recipes you zucchini or even cabbage or chard, i might add some spinach later for some more green.
but so as long as you have the out.
so long as you have onion celery carrots, anything else gets up to you.
so be free and prosper or something, right.
and i 'm just trying to get a little bit of color on the vegetables that will have a deeper flavor to the finish.
soups once your onions have gotten, soft and translucent and are starting to get a little bit of brown flicks and add the garlic.
i do n't want to add the garlic with the onions at the beginning because it could burn.
it 's a little more fragile.
chopped tomatoes you could use a can of tomatoes if you do n't want to use fresh ones and put in my herbs which are basil and thyme in a little bit of crushed red pepper 'cause there like a spastic sorry, i apologize right mix better room and.
now comes the hard part just hitting there are no hard parts in this recipe it 's great.
i 'm going to add some chicken stock.
if you wanted to keep this vegetarian, you could just totally use vegetable stock, i mean, this is a great super.
they 've got some protein in there.
alright so now i 'm going to put the lid on it, bring it to a boil and when the water boils will add the pasta.
i 'm using a little bow tie, but you can use macaroni, orzo or whatever any kind of little bite size pasta will work.
oops , hey, boiling pasta goes in and give it a stir.
and then set your timer for whatever your pasta says it takes to cook over it back up.
but keep an eye on it.
so it does n't boil over.
i 'm going to turn it down.
just a little bit right.
ten minutes later, my pasta is perfectly cooked because i 'm perfect.
i 'm going to add in some beans.
i 'm using these great northern beans, but cantalini.
i think are actually more traditional.
i think any kind of white being is good though, and some fresh spinach in a little bit of fresh parsley and the spinach just wilts pretty much immediately charge.
you 'll have to cook a couple minutes.
longer , but just want to get this.
so pretty and colorful OK, oh, lovely cool.
so soon as your greens are cooked in bright green and beautiful.
you 're ready to serve your soup which means, i also ever need to serve my soup should have been in first person.
should usually at home and i 'm going to great a little bit of parmesan on top some fresh basil would be.
if you had that K.
let 's try it really hot wow that is.
so good, you guys, parsley basil nice chewy pasta with just a ton of fresh vegetables in there, and everything nothing is not overcooked, i mean, this comes together in like twenty minutes.
so fast, it 's really healthy.
it 's light and i hope that this does the trick for all of you, people that have fall weather right.
