all right guys today we 're going to make some meatloaf.
i 've had people ask me to do a meatloaf recipe for awhile now.
there is all types of recipes out there.
i 'm going to show you one of the ways.
i do it for my recipe.
we 're going to need some ground beef.
i recommend a pound and a half to two pounds.
if you 're going to be feeding four to six people if you 're only going to be feeding one or two people you can go with a pound.
i 'm going to be making a pound.
this will feed actually up to four people really.
but really, if you want a big serving, just like two or three people for a pound to make a sauce for the top of it, and in my sauce i had a little bit of maple syrup.
some people use brown sugar.
i choose to use a little bit of maple syrup ketchup, of course, little bit of mustard i 'm going to use some grey poop on that 's what i have at home.
but you can use almost any type of mustard and a little bit of worcestershire sauce for the meat loaf itself, we do n't need all that much.
we just need to meet the ground beef.
we need an egg.
if you 're doing two pounds or a pound and a half or more, you could use two eggs.
i 'm doing a pound here.
so just keep in mind.
i 'm using a pound.
if you want to make more than pound, just add a little bit more of each ingredient, amusing about a half a cup of finely chopped onion, which mines frozen i gotta let it defrost a little bit here and then chop it up.
you need some stuffing mix or bread crumbs.
i prefer some stuffing mix, need some milk, and some salt and pepper, so let 's go ahead.
he ran first make the sauce.
all right fire sauce ketchup of course is always used in meatloaf.
we 're going to use about five to six tablespoons of catch up, so let 's go ahead here.
the first one is kind of half emptied out.
so that 's why i 'm doing six there, then about four tablespoons, maple syrup.
and i really recommend you get real hundred percent maple syrup as you can see here.
the ingredients just maple syrup that 's it.
if you go ahead and get some cheaper other type of sir up look at the ingredients on this, and as you can see there 's tons of ingredients there.
that 's not as good.
you want to use a hundred percent pure maple syrup if you can.
so four tablespoons of this and then about two tablespoons of mustard so, we 'll go ahead here, let me have something else.
and my spoon already has stuff in it.
so i 'm just going to estimate about two tablespoons, and then one tablespoon of worcestershire sauce, and i 'm just going to guesstimate again now.
go ahead and stir that all up.
and this is going to be the sauce that we use at the end to cover up the meatloaf and give it and i stopped taste it 's going to be a.
really , nice sweet, but also flavorful sauce.
so you end up with something like that, so now let 's go ahead and make the meatloaf.
OK , so now for the meatloaf, i 'm going to be using one pound of ground, beef at that, out of there.
and then we 're going to be using one egg.
also going to be using a half a cup of catch up now i 'm going to estimate guys 'cause i do.
this , a lot.
but measured if you want half a cup of catch up and a half a cup of milk.
again , i 'm estimating guys, but if you want to measure it go ahead and then about a cup of bread crumbs or stuffing mix.
probably about good.
and then, throw in your onions about a half cup of finely chopped onions, and then we 're going to walk about teaspoon or.
so of salt and just a little bit of peppers.
so i 'm going to make this about a teaspoon of salt.
and then just like a quarter to half teaspoon of.
pepper , and then this you could stir up do n't start too long.
i 'm going to just mix it up with my hands.
so i 'm going to go to the sink, after i 'm done with this, but i find it with my hands.
i can get everything mixed in really good rather than with a spoon that just kind of mixes it around this way.
i 'm kind of getting all the bread crumbs and everything mixed in really good.
so , yeah, i 'm gonna have dirty hands, but i 'll just watch him after so do n't stir it or mix it too, much.
it 'll get two combining, you might start breaking up everything if you commit too much, so this was looking good.
now we do check my pan here.
now we do.
is take it put.
it , in the pan and kind of shape it, and.
now you want to have your oven heated up to three hundred and fifty, and we 're going to cook it for about an hour.
and then what we 're going to do is add this, topping on mostly later about fifteen minutes before it 's done cooking, we 're going to add most of this on.
but i 'm just going to put a tiny bit on.
now not too much just to get some of that flavor going through there.
but we 're going to top it off later with the majority of the sauce ten minutes before it 's done cooking.
so now we 're going to put in a three hundred fifty degree oven for about an hour and about forty five to fifty minutes.
we 're going to take it out and put on that extra seasoning, so let 's go ahead and throw it in the oven.
all right, so here we go got my meatloaf, preheated to three hundred and fifty degrees.
and i 'm gonna put it in there for forty five minutes, like i said, and then will come back with fifteen minutes left and throw that extra topping on all right guys.
if you 're cooking for forty five minutes.
so now we got fifteen minutes left.
we have a total hour cook time now.
remember , i 'm cooking one pound of beef.
if you are cooking, a pound and a half or two pounds, you probably want to cook this for about an hour and fifteen minutes to a up to an hour and a half at the most rally.
so put the majority of this on i might not use it all 'cause i 've got plenty here it looks like trying to get it down the side, that is a little more get it down the sides and all over and.
now throw it back in for the last fifteen minutes, and there we have it after about an hour cooking we have the meatloaf, meatloaf done i 'm going to give it a second, to cool off and then cut off a piece and see how it turned out.
and here we go.
here 's our finished product.
as you can see it 's cooked fully through now, if you want you can use an oven thermometer.
and you can get precise reading.
you want this to be a hundred and sixty degrees in the middle.
so , if you have a thermometer, then you could test it out.
i 'll just go ahead and taste to hear see how it turns out.
it 's probably really hot.
still , no, it 's really good, really good that top glaze taste so good on there so easy recipe.
there guys pretty simple to make not too many ingredients, turns out, great every time you could save this for a few days and microwave.
always , really good.
so , if you have any questions let me know.
and we 'll see you.
guys , later, happy cooking.
