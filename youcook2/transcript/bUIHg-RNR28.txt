are you one that loves to eat calamari when you 're out at a restaurant?
but you 're super intimidated to make it at home.
well , today i 'm going to share with you, some of the rules in preparing columnaris first start at your fishmonger or your fish shop and make sure that when you purchase squid that it has a very nice briny aroma it should n't be fishy at all the squid should n't be slimy.
and the flesh should be firm in texture, but not rubbery, so the first thing that i 'm going to do is.
i 'm going to take the tentacles in the head away from the body, while you need to do is pull the body away from the tentacles.
so that 's just like this here.
and the innards should come out with it and now part of the innards here is the ink sack of the squid.
and that 's really great at flavors, risotto or pasta dough.
but we 're not going to use it today and now to separate the tentacles from the rest of the head.
you 're going to cut in between the tentacles in the eyes and your knife should be able to slide right through nice and gently we 're going to discard this whole thing.
the tentacles now you want to cut away the long tentacles.
these are the grasping tentacles and there you have a beautiful thing of tentacles and then for the cavity or the mantle of the squid first things, first, you need to remove the cartilage, which is inside, and the cartilage is also called a quill.
because it resembles as you can see here a quill or a pen or a feather.
so this is tough cartilage plastic you wanna make sure to get rid of this.
so now to remove the membrane on the cavity of the squid here you 're going to pull away the flippers which are these guys here.
and this is how the squid, steers itself, in the water.
so all you have to do is pull them away from the cavity, and the membrane that outer membrane should come away with it.
so now the last step is, of course, rinsing the mantle getting rid of any sand that might be in the cavity here and.
now we 're ready to cut the squid into rings and make the most delicious kalamari which is a lot easier than you think, first, what we have to do is cut the tubes into rings.
so i have a little bit of paper, towel to dry off the column.
and you need a very sharp knife for this, and you want to slices into anywhere from a quarter to a half inch rings, if you did n't want to fry or call amari like i am today you could certainly do.
so many different things with this, you could stuff the cavity with a nice breadcrumb stuffing and raise it in a little bit of tomato sauce.
so today i 'm using a very simple, seasoned flour mixture for the column.
mari now it 's all purpose flour a little bit of pepper coarse salt.
paprika and cayenne.
but you could use anything in this mix, you could use a little bit of old bay, so just mix it together, sift all of your ingredients again.
i 'm using all purpose flour, but you could use rice flour that would create a lighter coding, so this is mixed up nicely.
i have a neutral flavored oil here in my pot at three hundred seventy five degrees.
so you want to high temperature to now, i 'm going to put in the tentacles here as well and gently.
toss , the column mari, in your season flour mixture, any residual moisture will help the seasoned flour mixture stick to the column mari and since the tentacles are a little bit bigger than the rings.
i 'm going to start with them and they 're going to go right into the oil now whenever you 're frying.
i like to tell people to do this, make sure you do n't overcrowd your pot.
does it brings the temperature of the oil down, and the oil will soak into your batter or your flour mixture.
and you 'll get a greasy kalamari.
so , do n't over proud?
make sure you are watching the temperature and it 's staying at around three hundred seventy five degrees.
and these fry for about a minute to a minute and a half.
so not a long time at all.
so it 's been about a minute and a half and the column.
mari looks great.
it 's a light golden brown color.
transfer to a wire rack as always, when i 'm frying.
i like to transfer to wire rack instead of paper towels because i find if you put things right on the paper towels.
they start steaming on the bottom and your batter or your coding.
get soft and soggy.
when you come out of the fryer a little bit of salt and maybe some freshly ground pepper.
so there you go guys get this right to the table, maybe with a little cocktail sauce and lemon.
now , you know, how to make calamari at home it 's not.
