so you guys, and welcome to french gay cooking, today.
but great and bill, licious example of french cooking it reminds me that i never asked before.
but what does french cuisine mean to you bullshit, overcomplicated windy, oh, she is that really what you think this can go on anymore.
i must fight and prove you wrong.
forget the stars and the checks, white bread, ham and cheese.
these are the only ingredients you will need making a nation 's pride of the popular compliments.
you as known as a ham and cheese grilled sandwich.
this recipe is dead, simple and incredibly fast to make this very sandwich is supposed to have appeared around nineteen ten in a cafe in paris.
the name itself, cock MSU stands for crunch mister.
it 's supposed to come from a joke made by the owner of the cafe in which he told a customer he had human flesh in a sandwich OK.
let 's gather the ingredients.
one slice of good.
this life should be good for two reasons.
one it comes from a delicious ham and two.
it comes from a higher welfare poke of course now that you 've got it was the chicken.
we gotta step up two slices of sandwich bread.
not too thick.
otherwise , they wo n't fit sorry fit in watt.
oh , come on.
do n't be so impatient now?
we need two slices of thin cheese.
i am using GUI yet.
but feel free to use any other melted cheese if you ca n't find this one or if it 's too expensive or, if you do n't like the taste of it, or of course, if you hate french, and you dislike their food to build the kaka, macius on which dial up the ingredients in this exact order bread cheese ham cheese bread.
we wo n't cook it in a pan.
we wo n't use an oven either in fact, we could use a french cock.
MSU dedicated appliance, or you could use a toaster, a toaster, toaster.
now take a sheet of parchment paper, three times as wide as your sandwich and twice as tool, you can also use aluminium foil instead of parchment paper folded in half with wise place.
the sandwich on the left edge right above the folding line paper over it, if you rap it tight, no licks will occur.
it 's ready to go in the toaster for three minutes, and you need to rely on the smell of it, warning the porch and paper is absolutely impossible to burn.
but , but in any case of fire please do not put any water on the toaster.
a screwed up just unplug the toaster and put a lid on it, while it 's cooking.
let 's make a simple source in a mug mix butter flour and milk in equal proportions season that you got nutmeg.
this could be a great value store.
and , place it in the microwave for thirty seconds.
mix it well, and it 's ready to go.
the cock micere is ready use.
this source as a light shopping over the grilled sandwich.
crispy , melty totally addictive, you might want to eat a couple or maybe a dozen of these.
in fact, we could use more ingredients and make it even more decadent.
but you would then miss my point, which is french cooking can be simple and delicious and painless at the same time, i mean, that 's true.
all you need is someone that can teach you french recipes.
in a funny and simple and not.
