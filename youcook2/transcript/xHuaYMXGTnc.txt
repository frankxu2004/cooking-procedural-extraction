oh , hi, there everyone, i 'm jen this week on girls and boys.
is food week, so i thought i would make something for you, all, i really like grilled cheese sandwiches?
we did n't know this about me.
i eat grilled cheese sandwiches way more than i should say, i thought i OK, what is my hair?
i thought that i would teach you guys how to make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich.
also , i just woke up.
that 's why i look like this not wearing any makeup, and i 'm not looking good.
so , i apologize, but we 're going to do this, so, let 's start here.
are some of the things you 'll need a plate obviously, but are you also need some cheese?
and some bread, perfect.
the first thing you do is you 're going to take your butter and just spread that shit everywhere.
done next, you 're going to take your cheese and start slicing that shit.
just look at that cheese anyway.
take your cheese slicer thing and just start slicing it.
i like to just slice one full stranded cheese.
but if you want to do more than be my guest.
next you 're going to get your pan and start heating it up once the pan starts to feel like satan 's crotch then you 're ready to go.
they 're going to take your bread and just put it on there like that.
look how easy that was.
then you 're going to take your cheese and put it on top of that.
that was easy to.
and then you 're going to take your last piece of bread butter side facing up and slap it on top of that.
then you 're going to wait for it to stop sizzling as much as it usually is.
and then you 're going to flip it here.
we go, oh, shit look how perfectly i did that.
this is the color you want, you want it to be this golden brown color, you do n't want to burn.
you do n't want it to yellow looking this is holy shit.
i did that really well, and then you 're just going to wait until the other side stops is ling and flip that, and then, yeah, OK.
let 's try this again.
OK , well, that 's fine.
it 's OK, it 's alright.
we 're all good here, and there you have it, you 're perfect grilled cheese sandwich.
the other side the other side did n't look as great.
it 's a little burned, but, you know, what sometimes the burn adds, more flavor, you know, what it 's all good, so, yeah, thank you guys for watching.
