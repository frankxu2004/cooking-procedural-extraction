hey guys, so i 'm going to show you how to make kimchi, it 's pretty easy, recipe just takes kind of a lot of cutting.
i 'll list the ingredients in the infobox and so we 'll get started so first thing you need is to napa.
so what i do is i actually just cut it in half cut it in half and then just cut it in half again.
so then what you want to do is just make sure you cut off the hard part down here.
you do n't want to eat.
you wo n't be eating that, so make sure you just cut that off.
and , then all you need to do to cut these in the pieces just take your quarter, and then just make little and about one inch, one inch slices.
good something like that next.
we want to do is get one cup of salt.
and you 're going to put this in their container with ten cups of hot water.
and you want to dissolve the salt, and basically we 're going to do.
we 're going to put this into all the cabbage, have cut up and you 're going to soak it?
you 're going to soak it in salt water for about two hours, so i got my ten cups of water and the salt.
one cup of salt i 'll dissolved in here and.
so what i 'm going to do is just dump it into the kinch into the cabbage basically what this is going to do is.
it 's going to draw out all the water from the cabbage.
so , basically, just going to let this sit for about two hours, make sure during the two hours that you, you know, move the cabbage around.
i want to make sure that everything gets mixed.
maybe like four times during the two hours the next ingredient is one clove of garlic, so this is one clove garlic all messed up after this.
you want to take your half onion and minced that up as well, so again, like the garlic, this is the half onion.
an it 's all chopped up so as you can see.
this is nice and chopped up OK, so the next thing you want to do is basically take a piece of ginger.
probably about, about this much so about this much a ginger.
and mince this up as well.
next , take eight stocks of green onions and basically just want to shop these up, so just going to chop it up into small little pieces.
and the last solid ingredient is the radish.
usually , usually they 're actually bigger, but i just buy a smaller one.
now i can throw the whole thing in there, so we 're going to do is skin it first.
and then what i do is i cut it in half.
it 's kind of a krooked half, but to do so cut it in half first.
and what you want to do is you 're going to make these in the strips, so you want to cut him, cut them into little chunks like this.
i like that, remember like that, and then just you can actually just stack 'em too.
if you want and trying to make the trying to make these strips pretty thin, 'cause we 're gonna be eating these with the cabbage.
so you want to, to ridiculously big, the bus trip like this is about a good size.
so , if you 've cut up in chopped and minced all your ingredients what you want to do is take tablespoon.
and you want to do four tablespoons of sugar.
and you want seven tablespoons of fish sauce.
one two, and the final ingredient is of course, the red chili pepper, you know, it gives, it gives its famous color.
so there S B actually calls for one quarter cups.
but my family is kind of weak sauce, so we do n't do anywhere near that, so i 'm going to do about.
i 'm gonna do about make a quarter of a cup mario lamar OK.
and also you can also just test it as well.
so if it 's not hot enough for you once you put all the kimchi, you know, the cabbage and all this stuff together, you can just add more of the paste if you want.
so basically you can just do it.
softap you at all that stuff.
then , of course, you want to mix everything together, and it should kind of be like a, like a paste.
so it 's not it 's not pay.
see you want to add a little bit more water to make it a little bit more pasty and the final thing you want to do is take your kimchi.
take the cabbage out of the container and wash it three times.
and they want to do is just put it back into your huge container.
ann last thing you want to do is take your, your big pace that you made.
and of course, dump that in into the bowl as well into the big container.
and then all, you need to do.
it 's just mix it together.
so and the last thing you want to do is mix it all together.
so i just use the plastic bag you have a glove that will work too and then just basically mix all this together and of course, if you want to ferment it what i would do is put it into packing into jars really tightly.
so there 's no air and then leave it room temperature, overnight and then you can store in the refrigerator or if you want to just eat it right.
now it 's ready to go.
so i hope this story will help too, and happy cooking.
