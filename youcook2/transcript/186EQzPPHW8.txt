today , we 're going to make a really simple dish.
and it 's basically called bangers and mash.
he is a cook evenly throughout the potato so you do n't get his lumpy bits.
now one way of ensuring, that is, just pick them at all and chop that up lights out, and again.
same on that one.
do it in the middle for all of those worked think quite do that in the middle name?
mine so what i 'm going to do is punch up about many more than that.
otherwise , they absorbed too much water so chopping down the middle part in the pan.
then we 're going to boil them for a slowly boiling for about fifteen twenty minutes, probably about twenty minutes, OK.
now for the cooking of boy with the cattle or in there say your bedtime which is going to feel that what do we ever saw that put some sewing i think it helps to breakdown a potato and adds a little bit to the flavor.
so put there, and we 're going to take the water away.
so that 's fine pop.
the lid on turn the heat on, and we 're going to cook it.
similar oversight sort of middle heat for about fifteen minutes, while we 're cooking the potatoes in the back that i 've moved into the back.
we 're just going to put in the sausages, try and pick really nice sausages.
because at the end of day, is half the meal really the sausages.
so try and pick the good ones game from the butchers or various makes out there that are really nice.
just try what do you want so pop them in the oil.
obviously you can grill these if you 're a little bit more health conscious.
you have n't got a fry, them.
but it 's probably easier the longer do is just populated on those.
and i 'm going to turn him over getting nice and brown on the ice outside.
now probably only going to take about ten minutes in total again turn the heat down not too high.
just want to brown.
and without a cook him to death, so there 's your bangers.
there 's your match now, we 've got the sausages on the next thing you put on, we 've got a frying pan here is for your onions.
so what we want to do is chop them up.
OK , i 've got the youngsil chops two onions of use.
we 've got the oil, turning up a little bit to make sure it 's nice and hot and then we 're going to do is just pouring the onions, and then you can cook those either until they caramelize, which is slightly brown.
the outside, which is probably what i 'm going to do.
or you can cook him a little bit less.
they were at a ten minute stage quick test, and it 's a really good one.
it 's just stick a knife in.
if you can get it in and see if the potatoes are done.
these are clearly not done.
get mark, probably another ten minutes, outside, but i 'll check him just before then.
OK , we 're at the fifteen minute mark, now.
i 'm just going to check these papers.
yeah , they 're just slightly falling off.
what you want to do with the players is slightly overcooked them.
robin undercook them.
otherwise , you get the lumps.
oh , five more minutes so twenty minutes for the potatoes, and i think we 're done and then we 're going to have the perfect match.
OK , we 're at a twenty minute stage and i think the potatoes are done now.
so , which is going to check that if you put the knife in they definitely fall off if their hesitant, they 're not quite done.
so what i 'm now going to do is drain as much water as possible.
i 'm probably going to use a lid for that, and just typical way down the drain.
and we 're not going to use that water for anything at the moment.
OK , i 've put up side to back on the hob, which is i 've actually got it turned off.
so it 's really nice and hot.
now , now, what we want to do with a potato is just gently chocolate like.
so , and then we 're going to add a little bit fatter and mix it all up, basically, so it 's all pretty straightforward.
now what we can do is add a little bit of soul again to the whole mixture.
little bit pepper obviously outback to taste.
and then we 're going to pop in a little bit better now.
if you have your health conscious, obviously.
you can use a little bit less.
i know some of you out there are.
i 'm just going to put that in exile and just generally kind of mix it all together and try and get as many of those lumps out as possible, and then i 'm going to use one of these, these are great.
they may get your busy if you have n't got one of these, you can mix it by hand, do n't worry if you spill bit on the edges?
and we are US looking good, now looking good try and get as many of those things out.
now the important thing is when you mix and match play.
so you do n't want to keep mixing, mixing, mixing and otherwise ends up starting to be like glue, almost now, if you like your mashed potato, a little bit creamy are my i personally do.
but not too creamy.
you can add a little bit of milk again.
any sort of meal semi skim skimmed whatever you 've got.
do n't go overboard, you can always had a little bit more after, but it makes it much more creamy?
my children like it more creamy, but that 's really nice as we put it there lovely.
now there 's a lot of things you can add any mashed potato personally.
i prefer the choice.
actually there we are nice fine, fresh chives.
and you can add some of those with it.
put that on a plate and eat it there.
we got it mashed potato.
so excited, and i 've got it 'll be a vegetable.
just got a little bit of cabbage there.
a lot better cabbage himself.
but obviously you can have peas or whatever you like and finally.
collier , bakara, noised onion always goes well, like so and then we can just put a little bit of gravy on it.
and you 've got a fantastic mill.
so obviously put it is, and if you like a little bit more pepper, you can put it on azure one that is fantastic.
