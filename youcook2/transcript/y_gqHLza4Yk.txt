louis peppered of liliput loaf company in mullingar county, westmeath told us about the traditional irish potato cake box T, and he shows us here to make it using fresh local ingredients cabin bastian cabinet leader, and they tend to it, makes mashed potatoes in.
and they make box the loaf, and they make boxty, dumplings some.
but i 'm going to do the traditional deviren box, which is common in connemara, and they all and paste it ask if you got about three, or four.
nice , nice potatoes, i, i did the skin on.
because it 's nice color under skin and the skin of the potatoes nearly better for you than the actual center of the potato.
so that 's diseases.
so from there.
we rap it up and then you squeeze it.
sometimes it goes all over the place, so just squeeze out the starch.
it 's raining so today i 'm going to do a irish flag box.
three an, which is really it 's going to add in a little bit of sweet potato, any use.
any type of potato and he variety, well, i tend i 've tried different potatoes.
and they tend to use the roosters.
i just, like a habit, i suppose that you want to drive what kind you want a fairly hard potato, not too much moisture in it.
anna , fairly new, fresh potato.
so this is a bit of school irish flag box three, but i do have a little bit of the orange of their sweet potato.
in i actually invented this here about six weeks ago, if i do the market here every saturday morning, so salt is another ingredient now.
i , i tend to use, carry, and or seed or somebody else tend to mix the salt with grinders with herbs gives a beautiful flavor, the other thing, which is very nice in this particular boxes.
the faneuil, i love final to really nice herb and people are sort of put off.
because of them put off.
because of the anna cedie flavor goes very well in any dish as a flavoring.
it 's also nice and green.
these are westmead, scallions enough need scallions.
another west need stallions.
and they 've also got a nice green on them as well, and the organic locally produce organic scallions are absolutely delicious.
there 's nothing like what you buy in the supermarket, you can see the nice and the rear scallions nice and small plenty of green on them.
this is this.
i want to share this cheese is.
now which is going to go really well, with this particular box T, and it 's, it 's ryefield cheese, which is a gold cheese and it 's nice and crumbly i 'm going to stick my fingers into it and just add a little bit of that.
where is that from that 's seamless produced from two fields, down from here originally, so it 's nice two years?
i , love using local ingredients, and that 's why the markets are all about.
then we got in a little bit of flower vote to two to forest tablespoons of flour.
and it 's nice to get my hands license.
where are you now?
that 's just binds us, and i put in a little bit of buttermilk as well, and why it was wrong.
it just you 're making and i spaced and the keeps it all together in the pan so, i just put a small little buttermilk in now.
maybe if we were doing this with the mashed potatoes, we would n't need the buttermilk.
it just helps bind us.
so that 's really a snow where that 's the mix made is it always pride.
or can you bake as well.
the only way i 've ever been able to cook.
and they tried cooking, there 's an oil.
if i could n't answer, thinks is with a has castro in hand and i 'm facing the plan.
but not burning.
so and then we they put the mix into the water then, it is like the irish flag is not.
now the screen wise in orange anyway.
so and everything in life and i was from the midlands after about seven minutes, each side on the pan.
the box tea is ready to be served.
and i put the second one here.
