look at all these tomatoes.
what am i going to do with them?
all i have an idea, i 'm going to make soup today 's soup is really delicious.
so delicious cut four pounds of plum tomatoes in half.
i like to use the plum here, because they have less liquid in them so the soup will end up thicker and a little richer.
but i suppose you could use regular tomatoes and then just put them down a little more up to you to intensify the flavor roast.
the tomatoes and i 'm going to roast them with some garlic onions get everything.
nice and sort of cook down a little bit before i simmer it with my stock, two medium onions diced them up.
they do n't need to be too fine because the soup is going to be pureed later.
but not too chunky either.
let 's agree on half inch.
three quarters of an inch maybe like the way i 'm making you part of the process do n't.
you feel good.
it 's amazing how onions, really adds.
so much sweetness to things when they cook down right for.
so sharp and in their bra and there.
so sweet and delicious when they 're cooked.
i just love that three cloves of garlic they do n't even really need to be smashed going to smash him down just a little bit.
release some of their aroma and then everything goes on to the baking sheet with the tomatoes just get him down in there with the tomatoes.
it does n't matter if the sheet pan is crowded.
the juices will sort of gather in there and then they go into the soup pot.
anyway , so normally i like to spread things out.
if i want a lot of carmel ization.
here , i 'm not looking for tons of criminalization.
just a tiny bit drizzle with a quarter cup of olive oil and season with salt and pepper, you can season again later when you puree the soup together.
have your oven preheating to four hundred and fifty degrees and what you want to do is roast your tomatoes and onions until the tomatoes are dark brown in spots?
let me take about thirty five or forty minutes after thirty five forty minutes that tomatoes should be done, alright, see how they 've gotten kind of wrinkled.
and they 're starting to get brown in spots.
now they 're ready to cook even further into a soup, just scrape them into a large dutch oven.
so this is what you were building flavor here kind of, flavor that you would n't really get if you just simmer them from the beginning make sure you get all the pan juices into your pot.
all right and then to that, add four cups of chicken broth can use homemade.
if you have it, that 's always better.
you 'll probably need a little more salt if you do that when the soup comes to a boil you want to turn it down to a simmer.
and then let it cook uncovered until it 's slightly reduced in the tomatoes are really nice and soft when the soup is simmered for.
twenty , five minutes.
it 's time to puree it.
i 'm going to use an emergen blender because i have one and i really like.
using them if you do n't have an immersion blender, use a regular blender.
but make sure that you only fill it about a third of the way and then cover the top with a towel.
because hot liquid expands, and it can be a little crazy in there.
the great thing about emergen , blenders.
no splatter, basically no mess, these kind come apart so they 're really easy to watch really sweet from all that roast in.
so , i think it needs a little bit more salt.
i said i did n't want more pepper, but i do want more pepper.
there 's not a lot of seasonings in here.
so you want to make it really fall flavored with what you have.
i think sprinkling a little basil over the top at the end.
as a garnish is nice.
or you can store it all in and flavor of the whole soup.
so delicious like summer in a bowl.
that 's why i like to freeze it for later so that i can experience summer all over again, in the winter.
no , i mean, i do not like to let go.
i do n't know about you.
but summer is my favorite season, and i like to eat as if it were summer all year, long make this soup, and you 're going to be able to give it a little drizzle of olive oil and enjoy your summer.
tomato soup, freeze some keep it for later or why not chill.
this , and serve it cold.
i bet that would be delicious.
