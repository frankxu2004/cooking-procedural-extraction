hi guys, i 'm more of a talion on this episode of learning the kitchen.
i 'm going to show you how to make meatloaf, we 're going to make it very, very delicious so much.
it 's exactly like my mother 's.
the only difference is, we 're using ground turkey instead of regular meatloaf mix, which is ground beef.
veal and pork over the ingredients.
and , get started you 're going to need some ground turkey from plain breadcrumbs.
one small onion finely chopped two cloves of garlic minced fresh flat leaf parsley chopped roll egg, and for the filling, slamming hard boiled eggs.
sharper malone tommy john regional.
and you, of course is going to need a little olive oil salt and pepper, very, very easy ingredients and this is going to be absolutely delicious, like i said, it 's exactly like my mother 's.
the only difference is, i 'm using ground turkey instead of pork, veal and beef, which is your traditional meatloaf mix.
i 'm, you know, anytime using are everything and making a recipe for ground beef meatloaf meatballs.
i try to sneak in some ground turkey in there just 'cause it 's leaner and if i can disguise it.
so that nobody will figure out what it is.
then i do it.
and this is one of those recipes.
it 's so, so, so good you 'll never know.
it 's not ground beef pork and veal OK.
so what i 'm going to do now is take my one small onion.
i filing diced.
i have two cloves of garlic that i 've missed.
i 'm just going to cook these up in about tablespoon available to look like translucent by five six minutes and then american cool for five minutes get my onion and garlic mixture cooling what happens.
i 'm a chop up my general salami, and now traditionally in a talent whenever we make battalion, meatloaf called or picked on, and it 's stuffed.
with like salami, provolone and hard boiled eggs so that 's exactly what i 'm going to do.
i 'm just taking four ounces of sammy, and i 'm just chopping it so it 's nice and fine may not too fine.
because you want to be able to bite down on it, and as you know, whenever making meatloaf or meatballs or anything like that you do n't really want to too much.
otherwise it becomes tough.
so i 'm going to do all my mixture whoops in the bottom of the bowl mix.
everything together and then at the last minute put in the ground turkey.
this is my sami.
i 'm just breaking it up with my fingers, a little bit is all stick together once.
i am going to amanda next.
let me continue to work on the filling.
we have that we have are cooked onions and garlic and this is going to add a lot of moisture to it and we want that, especially because, well, we 're using ground turkey, and as we all know it could be a little dry one egg running their broke my own rule there and did n't break into a separate bowl, which you always should some fresh chopped parsley by three tablespoons through three two to three tablespoons as much as you like season, this, with some pepper.
we want to make sure the season every element of the dish.
but do n't go too crazy on assault.
because approval and very salting very salty and.
so is the permanent journal which we 're going to put in about quarter cup or.
so three tablespoons to a quarter cup that 's almost perfect great done going to adam back tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil again, it really keeps things moist and let me just work this together as perfect, put in a little bit of bread crumbs you really do n't need a whole lot.
but a quarter cup.
and you can see i have n't put my hands in there.
yet will wait out till i wanna.
wait till we put in the turkey for that.
so set this aside 'cause.
now we 're going to chop up our problem OK, i 'm just going to take off the very top.
the rind and practices shopper alone is very sharp.
so you really do n't need a whole lot and just cut it in little pieces little.
bite size pieces like that, get my perm alone over there.
now , i forgot a very crucial ingredient, oh, my mother would be freaking out right.
now if you saw, this, you need a little milk that 's always there secretly, she makes meatballs or meatloaf, whatever i do n't know why she, she just says.
it makes everything really, really moist and tender.
so we 're going to put in a couple tablespoons of milk.
i use whole milk you can use whatever you have on hand.
all right, we got that done without provolone chopped horrible legs on hand think.
i have a cookie sheet.
here baking sheet whatever you call it going to put a little bit of olive oil in there.
so that does n't stick.
now we 're going to add an hour ground turkey when i work this as little as possible before i put my hands in there.
i want to see them turkey for the little song pepper.
remember we have a lot of salty.
parmigiana , jonalyn, there an provolone so be careful, do n't go too, nuts alright cooks, best tools go in there with your hand and makes the whole thing.
OK , i make sure it all makes some just going to put it on this baking sheet.
now we 're going to flatten this out.
OK , flatten it out as much as possible get rid of any air bubbles.
otherwise , you 'll get a slice of meatloaf that 's like hollow, which come on alright plan.
get it read.
it bubbles perfect.
now i 'm going to stuff it right down the middle.
we 're going to take half about provolone, which i know, does n't seem like a lot.
but it 's so, so strong.
you 're really overpowered the whole thing.
if you put too much we 're going to take hard, boiled eggs in everything stuffed in italian households anytime making.
i do n't know big CD or anything like that.
we always put hard, boiled eggs, put the rest of the provolone around it like that, and.
now just with your hands put in this closer to me with my hands.
i 'm just going to work this together to bury the eggs and the problem, perfect look at that thing of beauty, OK, oh, forgot to mention pretty you oven to three hundred fifty degrees.
so it 's waiting for you and this puppy is going to go in there for about forty five to fifty five minutes by which it should be perfect by then, introduce forty five minutes.
forty five minutes is probably ready in skills.
my meatloaf is done looking for forty five minutes, and you can see craft a little bit op that 's perfectly fine that just means that under such a good job at sealing the top.
but either way it 's delicious.
now let the school for a couple minutes.
i 'm just going to actually use my parchment paper as a guide to transfer this onto my planner.
there we go smells.

so , so, so goodnight, italy.
we do n't eat me alone for the grieving read it with like threats.
