hi , welcome to alexis kitchen.
today , i 'm going to make the national, so for the villa schnitzer, you will need a very thin piece of veal.
i have an egg wash here with two eggs and some milk and salt and pepper.
i 'm going to whisk up and combine all the ingredients go.
and then you 're going to need some flower, and some bread crumbs we need a lemon for the decoration later.
we need some safflower oil bets for to bake the schnitzel in the pan.
and i like to use the safflower oil because it 's neutral and taste it can take a lot of heat.
i need some better and i need a little bit of olive oil because i need to flatten out my schnitzel.
i do n't have one of those meet hammers to crown vision itself, families going to use the back of my pan.
i have a little bit of saran wrap here which i 'm going to put a little bit of olive oil on print that out with my piece of video.
this is already pretty thin, but the middle could be a little thinner.
but the sun here add another piece.
i was there and rap now, and i 'm going to put a little bit of olive oil on top of the meat.
so it does n't stick to this around.
you go so it 's pounder meat.
so , so, we 're going to start with our flower, and you really just want a thin layer of flowers.
so , do n't press the flower in there, just sprinkle a generous on top.
make sure you get every piece of meat and make sure you shake off the access ego.
now it goes into our egg wash.
and now it goes into the breadcrumb and you do n't want to press your.
bread crumbs in there.
because a traditional wienerschnitzel has, is very loosely breaded and it 's supposed to sort of come away from the meat when it 's done in the pan?
and it will create three little waves so we do n't want to press the bread crumbs in their sort of just sprinkle them on top.
and that 's how this should look and now let 's go over to the stove and fryer, eficiency.
let 's turn some light on so, you see, something knowing the stove on.
and it goes, are safflower oil whoops to open that one first and you want lots of oil in the pan you want your schmitz into sort of swim round in there you need some brother and make sure this is really hot before you put your snippet in there?
you see all the bubbles, which is a sign that the, the, the pan and pot and the oil is hot in the butter has heated up.
so let 's add are schnitzel.
and now i said, to you earlier the schnitzel should swim in the pan and we 're going to make these movements hear back and forth you, gotta, be careful.
because everything is really hot of course i do n't know if you can see this.
but you see how the crust is coming up here, and here that 's how this should be.
do you have beautiful?
this comes up now gorgeous.
i think we can flip it now.
there you go see how even on this side, we have those beautiful waves.
this is gonna be so yummy.
well , i think i should trans ready look at this beautiful color, and i 've laid my schmitz in a little paper towels.
so it can all the excess oil can go in there.
so now we need is the middle piece of women here that will go on top of russian in space and there you go, this perfectly dash mix, it.
so i 'm going to go enjoy this thank you.
so much for joining me today and i will see you.
