hi , everyone, welcome to feast in the middle east.
my name is blanche.
and i 'm going to show you how to cook middle eastern food fast.
easy , and the modern way now how do i do that i 'm going to show you shortcuts.
today , we 're going to talk about a salad called fattoush napa.
touche is actually an arribe word.
that means pieces of something little bits of something.
so in this case in this salad, we 're going to use bits of bread, pita bread that we 're going to bake and form into croutons for the salad.
so it 's kind of like a bread and vegetable salad it 's kind of close to penn zanella, which is italian version of this salad that said, we are going to start with the veggies with this salad, you want to use vegetables that are in season right now, i happen to have some amazing tomatoes and cucumbers.
so we 're going to add about two cucumbers that already slice.
these are the persian style cucumbers which do n't have the big seeds whoops.
i should probably take out the cutler.
here , traditionally, the salad uses green bell pepper, but i love red.
so i 'm going to put red bell pepper in, here.
so this all is going to have tons of vitamin C and these are the tomatoes from my backyard, so i have about three small chopped tomatoes.
you could use roma or beef steak whatever kind of tomatoes you like.
and then for the herbs this is really key for this salad, i have some finely chopped parsley about a handful of chopped parsley.
half a cup probably, and i have another fourth cup or a third cup of chopped meant.
now this is actually the basil of the middle east italians like to use basil.
we like to use minutes so that 's how it 's a lot different from penn zanella.
so we 're going to use some mint and to give it a nice fresh taste.
we 're going to put some green onions probably about three chopt you might be thinking, this is kind of close to taboola, which is in another one of my videos.
it 's kind of different because the vegetables are a lot bigger.
and we use the bread, which i 'll show you how i 'm going to prepare in a few now.
this is a used purple onion.
this is traditionally, what 's used.
not white onion butt purple.
i think this really makes a difference in this salad, i use about a half of a one and about one clove of garlic that 's been chopped.
you could use more if you want, but i have about one clove that 's been chopped.
so this is the basis of this salad.
it 's beautiful and colorful so far.
i have n't even started with the dressing.
but what we 're going to do is talk about the croutons of the salad, which comes from pita bread.
because that 's what we like to eat in the middle east, a lot of pita bread.
but a lot of it goes stale.
so this was a great way to think of how another use for stale pita bread instead of throwing it away they came up with this.
if you 're a low car person, you can use sprouted tortillas for a change.
so i have whole wheat, pita bread, that 's been cut into squares and actually stale bread works better.
it turns out crispier in the oven, and i 'm going to put actually, uh, a little bit of garlic powder to, to season it and salt.
so here 's some salt.
put some on there.
we have some garlic powder and here i believe.
so , here 's some garlic powder just a little sprinkle, you do n't want to draw on this stuff and garlic powder and some olive oil about two tablespoons.
now , traditionally, this salad was made by deep, frying the bread.
but what is the point of eating the salad if you are going to deep fry, the bread.
right , i mean, you want this to be a healthy salad, so this is my adaptation.
my modern adaptation to the salad, and it actually do n't sacrifice flavor.
so i 'm just stirring this up.
i 'm just going to put this in a pan and i 'm going to bake it until it 's browned, and crispy so here.
we are we 're going to put this in an ice sheet.
and i have the oven set for four hundred degrees and it only takes about six minutes to cook up nice and brown.
so i 'm going to just put this in the oven right now.
OK , so my croutons are nice and crispy.
now you can use store bought peter chips if you want, but why bother if you can make it so quickly and easily at home.
alot of the times those pita chips have a lot of funky oils in there that i would n't want put it in my food and they also put too much sodium.
so this way i can control how much sodium.
how much fat goes into my croutons.
so that 's that.
now we 're going to go back to the salad, we 're going to make the dressing just.
basically , i 've got the juice of one lemon already squeezed into this bowl.
i 'm going to add about two tablespoons of olive oil and to that, i 'm going to add some mac now.
some mac is that beautiful purple spice that 's made from a berry, and it gives it a nice tangy flavor.
so i 'm going to add that, and i 'm just going to whisk it, it does n't take long.
i do n't need any fancy contraptions.
this is, this is a salad dressing folks, it does n't get simpler than this.
so the cemac is really, what makes this salad a lot different than tabouli as well.
so anyway, we 're going to add this to the vegetables look how gorgeous.
this is n't it smells so good.
it 's got a really nice fresh flavor, and.
now we 're just going to add some salt to taste and then finally we 're going to add some of the croutons.
so i 'm just going to grab a handful.
toss it in.
and it makes a beautiful, hardy salad.
it can be a complete meal.
if you add some kidney beans, garbanzo beans chick, in whatever kind of protein you like.
and it makes a beautiful, complete meal.
and it 's really pretty to look at.
