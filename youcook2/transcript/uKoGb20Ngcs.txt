basic mutton curry.
hi , i 'm a new kind of welcome to sanjeev, kapoor, kesana and warm welcome to a series of cooking for beginners?
now , what do we do.
let 's make a basic mutton curry, but in korea is something that you can make on any occasion, be it just your everyday cooking.
or if you have some unexpected guests at home this car is.
so easy that you can make it in the pressure cooker and does n't take too many preps.
you want to have your is basic spices will quickly run through the ingredients for this basic math, i need button on the bone potatoes, tomatoes, onions is coriander powder fresh chili powder garlic paste garam, masala powder, turmeric powder bay leaves, chopped coriander, leafs, whole black peppercorns, cinnamon black cardamom green cardamom, cloves salt and some oil.
so what i 'm going to do.
now here is, i have a pressure cooker in which i 'm going to add some oil now.
mutton being a tough meat takes longer to cook.
so it 's always advisable to use a pressure cooker.
but there are some people who do not prefer using a pressure cooker.
i 'm fine with that, you can do it in a vessel specially, think bottom vessel, where you just have to keep on sorting the masallah and then let the modern cook on medium heat if you put it on very high heat, the mutton may get little bundt.
so i prefer using a pressure cooker so that once you have everything in an.
you have put the lid, you 're really free to do your other things at home.
i prefer using a pressure cooker, but if it 's chicken or any other meat, doing it in any other pan is absolutely fine.
so the oil is validated after the oil is heated.
we have to first add the whole masallah.
we first add the bay.
leaf then will add some clothes do n't add too much of the whole masalas.
because it 's very powerful in flavor and apart from that we 're also going to add garam, masala powder towards the end.
so after close, we 've added green, cardamom will just add one black cardamom about an inch of cinnamon.
some black peppercorns.
and , once you saute this will automatically get the flavor of all the whole spices in this whenever you have to make any curry like this.
first , you add in the whole spices, and then, you add onions, tomatoes and all the other pastes.
so you see this nicely getting sorted, so, after this will add onions.
i have onion which of finally chopped the reason that i prefer shopping manuals find is that the browning happens faster.
you see, this more than onions better, will be the body on the consistency of your mutton gravy?
much you have to wait for awhile till this actually gets bold and brown in color, and this may take anywhere around seven to eight minutes if your onions are finally chopped and you will find a lot of other recipes where they use onion paste.
now you could also do that, but what happens when you grind and onion, first, the water gets evaporated.
and then the browning happens.
so instead of doing that is better to chop it up like this start your cooking in the meanwhile, let me also tell you one thing.
these modern pieces that i have your nicely washed, and mutton.
whenever you buy make sure it is bright red in color, never buy pale looking modern usage is it needs to be absolutely bright.
red in color, which means it is fresh.
similarly , with seafood problems have to be white.
fish has to be absolutely white.
and if a fish smells fishy, which means it is not good, so, let 's get back to the onions.
now it started getting pink which means it will start browning in awhile, and once it starts browning do not leave the pan because it is born very quickly.
so we just want nice golden onions after which will add in the ginger garlic paste.
now what happens, if you add in the face right now.
the onions will not brown so we have to first brown the onions, and then add whatever other spices that you want to add OK.
now , we 're going to be adding tomatoes to this a lot of recipes also suggest using yogurt.
so , if you want to add yogurt in your recipe avoid the tomatoes because if you add yogurt reduce the gravy we 'll go sour.
and we do not want us are.
gravy so it 's up to you.
i prefer using tomatoes, because the color goes nice and red, apart from tomatoes.
i also use kashmiri, red chili powder, which also gives very good color to the gravy.
OK , so you see this, the onions have started turning golden will now start adding the ginger garlic.
paste , first, because that also takes some time to cook the raw flavor of garlic and ginger has to go or else.
it does n't leave a very good flavor, lingering on your tongue.
so this needs to be sorted along with the onions.
continuously , you can leave the flame slightly high.
but if you were doing your other things also in the kitchen make sure this sorting is done on low heat.
OK , you see this, this is just perfect.
now we start adding all the other dry spices again.
i 've lowered the heat.
becaus spices born very far since it 's in powder form.
this is coriander powder, red chili powder kashmiri chili powder.
actually turmeric powder, and just give it a mix after you have sorted all the marcellus now.
let 's add the mutton pieces like this one by one will add the modern hill.
please make sure that the mutton is fresh or day old, martin also will take longer time to cook.
of course, it will get cook.
but it 'll definitely take longer time after you have added the mutton.
let 's add some salt here.
and this needs to be sorted julie well, with all the muscle as we have yet not added the tomatoes that we will add after we see or the martinville, i believe in searing the mutton along with the masallah this earring or this mixing needs to be done on high heat or as the model will start leaving water and we do not want that to happen at this stage.
so make sure the flame is high, and you have to keep on mixing this in the meanwhile.
let 's do something.
let 's add some coriander also.
your , i prefer coriander leaves rather than adding it just as a simple, garnish.
so let the coriander also get roasted in the masallah and your, we have to add potatoes after you have added all of this mix.
it again nicely since we using the kashmiri red chili powder, you find the color going red and a red mutton curry definitely looks very appetizing.
so after you have mixed everything, well, it 's now time to add tomatoes, so let 's add tomatoes here, and some more salt.
we 've already added some salt in the beginning.
so now a little less, and again just give it a mix we have to sort.
it is still at the meadows go slightly softap, and that 's when we 'll add water.
an LED this cook on medium heat so you see the tomatoes have gone soft.
let 's add water, and.
so after you have placed the late we will cook this till about six misses are given out on medium heat, of course, if it 's on high heat, it could be anywhere around ten to twelve.
this is, but six whistles on medium heat.
the model will be done.
but the mutton has to be very fresh a day old or a day or two old button, takes more time to cook of course.
it will cook, but maybe about ten vessels after the whistles are given out.
let the pressure cooker rest for awhile, till all the pressure settles down and then we will see how the mutton curry looks right now, will wait for all the whistles to be given out?
now let 's see, how this martin querrey looks open.
the pressure cooker after the whistle or the pressure has settled down the color is perfect that switch on the heat now we have to add two ingredients here.
one is the garam, masala, powder garam, masala powder should always be added towards the end because we added for flavor and fragrance.
so in this case, it is just for flavor and fragrance.
and this needs to be added towards the end little bit of garam, masala, powder and coriander, we will add so this the potatoes also have quoted.
this got slightly mash into the gravy.
this is exactly how we should make it.
this is like melt in mouth mutton curry.
just take this.
and me just perfect varisoft mutton.
while because it was very, very fresh spice levels are just as needed.
the color is perfect.
the tanginess is right there.
this is just fine.
let 's switch off the heat.
so we scoop the martin, carry out in a serving bowl anvil, garnish this with some chopped coriander that 's it simple or basic mutton curry is ready.
solve this, with piping hot steam rice and make this recipe.
