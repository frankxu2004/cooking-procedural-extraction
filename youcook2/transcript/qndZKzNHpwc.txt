look in the sushi, one, oh one today, we 're going to show you the basis of sushi talk about some of the ingredients and demonstrate how easy it is.
for you to take my counter and bring it to your home.
so let 's start off with what you 're working with public readings, you need to pick up starting with the naughty with dried seaweed.
you can find these in most asian stores, here in town usually come together in one piece like this.
we 're going to do today.
we 're going to cut it in half and work with half a sheet of nori.
the second ingredient is going to work with is your rice.
no , they do n't come free package like this.
there 's a whole process that making the rice you 're basically doing one cup of rice, and we 're using short grain, cal girls to one cup of water when you 're done making your rice will add a better solution to it, it 's usually one fourth of a cup of solution to one cup of rice being made the type of rice that we 're using here is.
sushi rice, the term sushi refers to the rice and not to the general type of food that we 're working with today will be making two types of sushi.
when will be the california style inside out maki and the second one will be a habit?
and we make it to california and spicy cheese, so let 's begin with their path after ice.
and for your spicy tuna roll will be using stallions and spicy, tuna mix this mix consists of hockey or yellow fin.
tuna chopped up and mixed with combinations.
saracho sauce and our own special house sauce, our house sauces.
spicy , spicy aioli.
here we call it our raw sauce.
you can substitute any type of spices sauce that you want.
i 've seen people use some tabasco and how it feels but spicy tuna is a universal term for anything where you take your fish.
kick it up A notch.
so beginning with your pad again a couple things, you really need to know, i 'm using gloves today to kind of make sure that i do n't make a big mess in front of camera.
but we 're going to take a bunch of our rice here about four to five ounce portion of rice, and you see a balled up, take it from our pot preparative cool.
i 'm going to pull it up.
so i 'm just going to make sure that i keep my working area very clean place it in the center of your pad.
i 'm not going to do what i call the boat at some point.
one of the hardest things that beginning sushi people are going to face with is trying to keep everything on your mat from here.
i 'm going to take the rice.
split it in half evenly distributed onto our path.
and then i 'm going to form a bow tie using just the tips of my fingers.
i 'm going to press the rice out to the edge of the nori pad, starting with the outer edges, having my little boat.
i design and then, i 'm going to fix the rest of the perimeter reason.
you do this, as you 'll see at the end of your role that if you take a little attention to detail at this point of your rolling sequence, sushi is going to look excellent, we start chopping it up and serve it to your guests, are to yourself, and you see in a matter of seconds.
i 've gotten evenly distributed ball of rice now.
imagine my sushi roll.
next even to consider is what kind of toppings you like to put into this role as i said it 's an inside out roll.
so this part of the rice that you 're looking at will be the part of the sushi roll that will actually seeing.
so whatever you put on to this part of the role will be presented to your customer.
your friends, or to yourself in this case were using a five plus pie slice.
japanese saracho, selves combination of japanese chili spice joint orange rhine, black and white sesame E, seeds and some dried seaweed.
this is the first layer of spice to your spicy tuna roll.
now this is what makes it inside up.
i 'm taking my ipad.
bring it over be very careful to keep all the ingredients here in nice, and neat and anything.
i 'm going to place onto this side of the pad, which is now the inside of your role.
will we consider what you 're filling starting off with the scallions, jenna 's helping with scallions and then i 'm taking a couple of inches of a spicy tuna melts here 's where you can make a big mistake?
one of the cardinal sins of sushi rollers are trying to put too much into two little bit of a role as you can see.
we 've cut this role in half so it 's a half pack.
so anything more than four or five ounces of material inside.
will give you a role that will not properly seal, and you will not have good sushi experience.
so at this point i got all the fixings for my spicy tuna roll now?
here 's where the sushi chef skills come into play.
i 'm going to take my fingers and again, we 're not going to be manhandling.
sushi is very delicate.
art is very delicate food and take my thumbs.
take my fingers, and i 'm going to gently raise the roll up until like cuff, i 'm going to decrease the air gap between your fish union or ipad and press it up against there.
i sent, is i 'm actually going to gravity, be my friend.
i 'm not going to manhandle the sushi as you can see.
i 'm just basically with my thumbs picking up whatever bits of rice need to be placed onto those nori pad with my fingers, my pinkies and all my fingers.
i 'm gently tucking in the role and as i tuck and press tuck and press with my thumbs in my fingers, and letting gravity do all the work and the role will fall on itself.
now the piece of equipment that most people consider critical to sushi rolling for banding map can come into play for cleanliness in for ease of use.
i wrapped in saran wrap will take your map.
place it over your role and at this point.
one of the nuances of the sushi roller come into play.
we 're going to form the role and not press it down.
give a gentle bit of pressure to seal that bottom half the rule again.
gravity covered the role, my mats going to form it going to give a little bit pressure.
and then i 'm going to use the map and my chopping board press form roll press form, rolf, and after three rolls, i 'm staring at the scene or bottom half of my sushi roll.
and if i 've done a good job, which we could have are sushi rolls in sealed and flip it over to stop side and again you can see where the presentation of the role from the beginning and attention to detail spreading out my spicy sauce or spicy powder comes into play.
the next step, some totally style knife for you.
nava sushi rollers people ask me, you know, what kind of night should i get.
this is nine ninety five from hawaii.
but if you keep your blade sharp, maintain your knife.
and you use a proper as far as cutting techniques, you could use any knife in your kitchen.
what we 're going to do is we 're going to bring into our water.
play , and you 're going to want to keep a bit of water right.
next to you just for multiple purposes to watch your knife to clean your hands.
and right next to water bend, you want to have a wet pattern reason being is cleanliness is next to godliness in sushi rolling.
and , i 'm constantly dabbing the tips of my fingers, and any piece of my body that comes in contact with the sushi roll.
so i 'm dipping my life into the water, and this is a quick little chicken.
nice little trick keep your pad by the water and watch a dream now if you look closely at the knife.
and he left it on the blade.
it 's coated with water.
so when i come into my sushi roll, i should have a clean cut.
my knife is sharp.
i 've maintained it.
and there is n't a lot of material on here.
i should have a clean cut going through the road and find the center of my role going to do two cuts.
i 'm going to initial cut.
they 'll take me in about half an inch into my role and then a second cut should get me to the base of the role at which point why my life quoted in water watch a dream, find the centerpiece of my second half.
when i first excuse me when cut, two cuts quite my knife repeat and cut to cut night goes on the board spicy.
tuna , ready for presentation.
