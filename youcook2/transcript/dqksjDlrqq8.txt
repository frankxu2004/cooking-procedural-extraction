other than welcome back to young paleo, my name is jack.
and today what i 'm going to be making is pork fried rice.
so the pork i 've got here is just mince pork.
i 've got one half pounds of that and for the price, of course we ca n't use pastor or anything like that.
so i have shredded up one whole head of cauliflower.
so i just took their to qualify and just shred it up with a cheese grater.
and then also was going in that is one red bell pepper.
now i have diced this so that would be getting truck ten months.
the meats cooked.
and also i 've got a bowl full of or a good handful of fresh parsley there, which i will be also chopping up an pushing in with the meter and the rice along with for relatively small cloves of garlic, which will also begin cooked as well , now.
it 's about a bit of extra flavor.
i 've got some custom, dried sage dried thyme leaves, and some paprika that i 'll just put him with the meat as it cooks just.
so it 's not too bland and some salt and pepper for some extra taste.
so first things.
first , i will get my pad preheat.
it , and just added a little bit of olive oil now.
once i see it.
so i 'm just going to add tokens of the patent just cook it off.
get it nice and brown start, adding the garlic into it and some of the hubs and then once that 's brown duff we can check in all the other elements.
so it 's really simple.
quick dish to make should only take about ten minutes to do really and yeah, it would just be a nice way to fill a fill yourself, up and nice and healthy and it 's just good.
if you have n't got much time to cook for everyone and it 's just a really, really yummy meal in a quick amount of time.
so i 'm happy with that.
it 's hard enough, so, i 'm just going to.
i 'll break up.
OK , i 'm just going to allow that to sit over a second and i 'll break it up more as it cooks so just leave that.
and , while that 's cooking, i 'm just going to show up at my garlic cloves.
so , once you happy with the garlic, just check it out, and just start mixing it through and just break up that men 's mark, OK.
so as this is cooking through it 's going to start to wear some of the hubs.
now i 'm just gonna.
i 'm not going to really measure.
it is going to do a nice drizzle of sage and the same at the time and the paprika and also some salt and pepper.
OK , so just keep cooking until it 's brown.
and i 'll see you in a few minutes when sisters cooked everything starts about all the other ingredients, see you soon.
so the pork is browned.
i feel really nicely.
so what i 'm going to do is start to introduce the other thing.
so i 'm going to have the one.
the red bell pepper, so i 'm just going to make a corner for that, and just let it cook on its own.
and as has.
cooking , i 'm just going to chop up the parsley, so we get a bigger knife.
so just chop it up.
is finally as you can, OK, so i 've got all that?
parsley chopped out.
i 'm just going to slide it straight in, there.
so it 's got some really nice color in there.
now and just mix it all up through.
now i can do as well.
if you want to like sweet, and things up is that a bit of honey, maybe one that little bit of source to it.
so now what i 'm going to do is introduce the cauliflower rice.
i 'm just going to make a space for it here, and this at all in and just let that cook through.
so again, once you 've just mix, it all through and make sure the cauliflower rice is nice it does n't have to be cooked all the way through.
because there 's quite small pieces stuff together.
he threw it really, and just give this like five minutes.
just mix it up and then we 'll be ready to play it up.
so , yeah, just give it mad, about five minutes, just keep mixon get rounds cooking yet.
and you can add some more salt and pepper or whatever you like, to it.
and i 'll see you in a few minutes when we 're ready to play it up.
hi , there and welcome back.
so i 've just cooked that through for about five minutes, and it 's just about ready to be distant.
and it 's smelling great.
so like i said, this is great for really quick snack.
if you just want to whip it up in five to seven minutes when it feeds quite a few people as well, with very little ingredients be honest, OK.
so there you go it 's young palios pork.
i really hope you enjoy it and i 'll see you here for another great recipe.
see you soon.
