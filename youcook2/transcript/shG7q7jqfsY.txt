hey , what 's up.
i 'm twenty fatso, siciliano.
from on the grill radio today we 're going to talk about how to cook beer brats alright to get started.
you need two ingredients, one braz two beer that 's really about it.
we 're going to focus on the brought worse, right.
now brought your soul there 's a lot of fat and brotzen inside that 's a lot of water and as you cook the braatz, that water turns to steam and the problem is a lot of times on the grill brotz explode and who wants that.
so what we 're going to do is, we 're going to parboil them in the beer for about fifteen minutes finish them on the grill.
now to let that steam escape we 're going to take our forks and put two little holes in each of the braatz.
but it 's not going to let the fat in the juices pour out.
that 's what we want.
we do n't want we want to keep the juices the natural juices inside the braatz 'cause that 's where the flavor comes.
after we puncture all of our braatz we 're going to put him in a pan of beer and the best part about this is you can keep it on your grill.
the whole thing happens outdoors.
this can happen outside.
roll them over about halfway through total cooking time of the parboiling, is going to be about fifteen minutes?
all happens outside on your grill are brought worst has been sitting in the beer now for fifteen minutes, we flipped it over now is ready for the grill.
we parboil it to ensure.
that is cooked through out we do n't want it to dry out while they 're on the girl.
we do not want to over cook him.
we 're going to come over direct heat for about four minutes per side.
just the crystal the skin will flip over give another four minutes, they 'll be done all you do after that slap amanda button puts in a spicy mustard on him.
maybe throw a little bit of sauerkraut autumn, and you will have amazing beer brotz.
