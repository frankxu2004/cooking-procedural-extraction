now this is one of my favorite on trace.
now it is a little bit more of a restaurant.
despite you can adapt it and do it quite easily at home now.
first thing we 're going to do.
we 're going to make an avocado mousse with a little bit of.
wishabi , nice ripe avocado is going to cut it in half, be very careful doing this.
just twisted take the cedar little chop into it, pull it out till the avocado, avocado into a little, mix a little bit of wishabi powder hill.
we can use fresh with sabi, the powder is a little bit stronger.
what we 've got here is a little bit of sugar, syrup, sugar syrup will give it that beautiful sweetness.
and it 'll balance without heat of the wishabi, and just pure brought.
once you 've actually created just taste it.
now you get that real sweetness of the sugar syrup and tights with sabi.
but with the sugar content, you actually want to add a little bit of a city to just to combat it.
so the best thing is a nice fresh light polluted lime juice into it absolutely perfect.
we just let that sit there.
the next step is a beautiful dressing.
it 's a diakon dressing is very typical of a japanese dressing.
it 's got beautiful balance now.
the first thing we 're going to do is to add all our liquids in a little bit of soy is actually a light.
so you do n't want to rich just into above a little bit of mirrors, little bit of sweetness to it, so it is it great balance also now.
the vinegar ross wine vinegar always really important, use rice wine vinegar, is typical in japanese cooking?
so we just add that to the base, and we 're going to be really careful and that little bit of sesame E or system is really, really strong.
so you do n't want to add too much, so just a couple of drops gnats give the dressing in a little bit of body.
we got a little bit of ginger rather than uh, and chop.
it really far we 've got a nice marker pine here.
it 's going to great a little bit of ginger into it.
if we had some.
dark , on which is basically a chinese radish same thing again, with a microplane.
what 's really important now, with this dressing is to actually let it infuse so just let it sit as long as you possibly can until you need it.
but the next thing to do is the salad.
it 'd icon very carefully.
nice thin slivers really important thing to do is when you chopping or your giuliani is to make sure you keep those fingers out of the way.
so i 'm going to rest the knife up against my knuckles, and i 'm just going to slowly chop.
and if you keep your fingers nice and cold united fingernails out, and you wo n't chopper model.
but then we have some nice little buttons.
now without cucumber going to do two things with it.
we 're going to do little strips or ribbons were going to rap it around.
so we can put our ocean trout roe on top of it, and the other ones were going to actually julie in it.
so just peeled to get our strips.
but just going to use a pella.
we 're going to try and dig into a little bit harder than what we normally would.
we 're just going to peeling what you 've got is a long strip like that, and if we just wrapping around like.
so it 's like a little casing.
now for a julian, that same size of the dicom julian strips put that into your boat, and you see that.
now you have nice little salad.
i 've dikhana, cucumber.
we 're going to add a little mushrooms and turkey mushrooms and just follow through that 's really, really important to have good quality, chilling, you want that beautiful bright red color.
you want it to be nice little cubes that little box size pieces.
so we 're just going to be really careful here and just cut straight down.
but a nice chunk i 'm just going to even that up.
so it 's a nice little cubes.
you can see the nice little box size pieces now to put this dish together.
we 've got our beautiful little salad is going to put a little bit of baby coriander, and it also.
now we want to put the baby coriander right at the end, you do n't want to put it in when you actually making yourself in the beginning.
because you wanted to look nice and fresh and you do n't want to get a little bit, just going to sprinkle it over.
nice little bit of salad on the plate.
yeah , we 're going to go back soon and very carefully, it 's going to place it on top.
now without to come up there, just going to place them on top.
we 've got a little avocado, meservy, moose, which can pull that into the top really want to just try and keep that shape.
now we 've got some beautiful salmon pools which is going to pull that on top.
really , go overboard and really he put on now.
we 're just going to dress out sooner.
you can see a little bit to dark on it.
that 's what you want that texture was pulled out all over the top believe it or not fresh with servings in season, we 're just going to put the smallest amount just grated over the top.
it 's just going to add to the mission.
and they have it guys are beautiful.
