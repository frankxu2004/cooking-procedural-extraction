some of you have asked me to make chicken parmesan.
so this week, that 's what i 'm doing, you 're going to need about a couple of pounds of chicken cutlets.
two beaten eggs, an on this plate, i have bread crumbs.
panko and parmesan cheese.
you can just have bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.
but i like to add the panko for a little crunch and just mix this up.
take your cutlet and put it into the egg and then just code it with your cheese and bread crumb mixture.
and i like to press it in hard, so it sticks really nice.
and i put them on a separate plate.
let 's do the rest of them fry your cutlets.
i fried them about three minutes on each side now.
take your cutlass and put them on some paper towels to drain while you make your next back.
after you done frying them put them on a cookie sheet that 's line data with parchment paper or so, so pet map.
or you can just grease it with a spray.
then you take your marinade, and i.
how link my recipe for this source.
it 's my basic mara, nada modern odd marinara.
and just put some i do n't know, i 'm taught.
you do n't have to drown it just a little bit is enough, thing takes slices of mozzarella cheese, and just put it on top.
some of them you might need to, i like a lot of cheese on it.
now you 're going to put it into a four hundred or four fifty degree oven.
and you 're going to put it in there for about ten minutes until the cheese gets nice and bubbly and melted it just came out of the oven.
i 'm gonna try it.
look at that AH gotta love that cheese.
look at that it 's gorgeous.
i made some zoodles on the side, but you should actually make a better pasta with the source and then put the chicken parmesan on top.
but i 'm trying to keep it a little low carb.
so i did it with zoodles.
it 's all good, so go.
i do n't always make this.
it 's such an easy dish, and i really, really make this.
but i do love it.
and i hope you try this, do n't forget to thumbs up an enjoyable more dinner recipes, check out my playlist and do n't forget to subscribe.
