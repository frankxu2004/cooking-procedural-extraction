they were going to do avoid jolino role fits one of our special roles that are on this special menu.
i 'm really excited because roles are so hard to meet at home and you guys always make it look so perfect.
so i 'm getting the trick for you guys.
let 's do it, alright so do n't get too enough grocery store, making your spicy to just add a little bit of male saracha.
maybe some sesame E oil and scallions your typical spices to them if you ca n't find albacore you can use salmon.
i got right here album form which is seared on the outside with sarrah, cha so it 's got a little spice to it today.
we 're going to be using soy paper.
if you can access soy paper seaweed, same thing rice, cover that very lightly.
massage in take that only flip this around, but spicy tuna, you can use asparagus cucumbers or whatever vegetable, you like anything.
they 'll go perfect with this fish, ever.
you prefer will take this and then will fold this to make it into a goal.
this where it gets tricky for me.
and you made it look so easy, so we 're going to take albacore here and instead of these up.
just like, so like i said, you can use salmon, you know, or you could double the tuner just had some seared tuna on top.
OK , we got that on their take a little saran wrap is n't a trick you want to put the saran wrap on top.
so does n't come apart.
take a little bamboo.
we want to press too hard.
just , just enough to keep it as mold make sure you get the sides presidential.
nothing is loose perfect.
so what the surround rap still left on cut it into eight pieces.
just another take this off and you got your eight pieces of graphic roll, you can use bamboo, bamboo, lease or banana leaves for garnish just to make it look nice.
let me take half of it will just separate him a little.
can we have our spinach?
that 's what i was waiting.
i like what is that what is that what is that spinach baby spinach or getting regular spinach, just deep fried into chips, which will take file like fifteen seconds ten seconds to write.
and it was nice and crispy.
so this is again.
what 's good right.
so we 'll just take this and then layered on top of the role and that 's believer right, and all it is, is just fried chips somewhere done looks amazing or i shut prob.
