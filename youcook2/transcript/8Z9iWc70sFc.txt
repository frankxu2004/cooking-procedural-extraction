hey , everybody my name is andre, and today, we 're going to be cooking some muscles, muscles that are a great source of iron and actually eat them once every two weeks just to maintain that iron level , up.
so we have a whole batch of fresh mussels here.
you want to make sure they 're fresh.
first thing you do is you want to rinse them under cold water.
clean them up a bit.
and then you want to go through each of the muscles, and you want to see if they have these things called beards if they do move them just pretty much.
pinched them and, remove the beards.
the second thing you want to check for is any muscles that are open.
so this one is you can see it 's opened.
so what you want to do is you want to pinch it and let it sit on the ground for a bit in two minutes.
if it 's not close, and it 's still open it means it 's a bad muscle.
so we want to toss that one up if any of the shells are cracked open like this one, then you want to toss them out.
they 've probably gone back.
what i usually like throwing muscles are garlic.
some olive oil and salt and use water to steam them.
but some people like steaming them with wine.
so we have the water already boiling over here if you want to add the garlic want to put a little bit of olive oil and finally add a bit of salt.
and you want to bring this mixture to a boil.
we have the muscles ready as soon as the water starts boiling, we 're going to steam them awesome into a steamer.
but now that the water is boiling we 're going to steam the mussels.
the only one about ten to fifteen minutes, i usually recommend ten minutes start the timer now.
alright it 's been ten minutes.
let 's go check out our muscles seat.
there cooked put that over here.
the whole place just start smelling muscles by now and then, popping out.
so , what you want to do is you want to dump them all in football.
last coming muscles have this ability to create, you know, even if you have just water steaming.
they create a really, really nice delicious broth.
so we 're going to dump all that on top of the muscles, remember, you had garlic in there.
olive oil salt, and for the finishing touches cut up a lemon and squeeze on top of everything.
it takes about fifteen minutes high in iron is really good three.
it 's healthy is delicious.
and like i said, it 's a nice boost to enerji that i 'm sure everybody needs this day.
and age that 's it muscles by andre.
i 'll see you soon.
