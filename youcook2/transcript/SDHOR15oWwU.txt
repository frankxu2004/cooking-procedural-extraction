i 'm going to be making the first ever video that i uploaded here to the nickos kitchen channel, of course, i 'm talking about my spaghetti and meatballs.
so is the first thing that we 're going to get started on my spaghetti and meatballs just into a large pot.
we 're going to start making our source so first thing is just some olive oil.
and i 'm going to be putting in some onion that i 've just roughly chopped up.
i 'm also going to be adding in some bacon that i 've just chopped up as well.
now i love bacon in the source and this is not an authentic italian recipe.
this is just something that i 've been cooking for years and, years, and years, other family keeps coming back for now.
i 'm just going to season with some pepper.
i 'm not going to season with some salt because the bacon is quite salty.
and i 'm also going to be adding in some garlic paste and just give that a good mixed around.
and i just want you to put this down for about two minutes, just until that onion, starts to soften.
so , once the onions have softened, the.
next thing i 'm going to be adding into some chopped up mushrooms and again just give that a mix around and just cook the mushrooms for a further minute.
so they just slightly soften again.
now the onion, the bacon in the onion is cooking along nicely.
now , i 'm going to be adding in some tomato paste and next i 'm going to add in a can of chopped tomatoes and very last.
i 'm going to be adding in summit shot parsley.
some fresh parsley now what i wanted to do is turn the heat down to low, and i want you to simmer this for twenty to twenty five minutes.
so , while their source is cooking away there were going to get started on making out now with my meatballs.
i just used beef, and it 's an eighty twenty split meaning.
it 's eighty percent.
beef , twenty percent fat, because we store our meatballs to be nice and juicy now two hour beef.
i 'm going to be adding in some dried breadcrumbs.
i 'm also going to add in a dried italian herbs.
mix , i 'm going to season with some salt and pepper next thing.
i 'm going to be adding in some garlic post next i 'm going to add in some fresh basil.
now , next thing i 've got some parmesan cheese.
just in here, some fresh parmesan cheese.
i 'm just going to great it just in there and lastly i 'm going to be adding in just an egg that i 've just beaten up.
make sure your hands are clean, and you want to get in there for this because it 's all about making the meatballs.
you want to get your hands straight in and work all those ingredients into the beef.
so we 've got a mixture there guys now.
what i want you to do is just break a piece off and just roll up in your hands just like that, and this is the size.
i like my balls, few of them bigger than getting bigger, if you want a smaller than make them smaller.
it 's completely up to you and just keep repeating that process with the rest of the mixture so our meatballs are done.
and what i 'm going to do now is just brown them off.
so brownian meatballs, just into a large pan on a low to medium heat.
i 've got some olive oil so just as easy as this.
i 'm just going to place and make balls into the pen.
now i 'm only going to be branding them off.
i do n't want to cook them true.
i just want to get some nice color on the outside, and i only want to brown these off for about two minutes.
so that 's what we 're after without meatballs, just branding off on the outside the guys.
i 'm going to be adding back in our pasta mix, two hour meatballs.
so i 'm just going to be pouring them over like that now.
i 'm going to turn the heat down to a low heat, and again, i 'm going to simmer this for a further twenty minutes.
we just waiting for a mate balls to finish off.
i 'm going to make a very quick easy, homemade, garlic bread to go with it, so just into a small bowl.
i 've got some melted butter to that.
i 'm going to add in some fresh basil that i 've just chopped up and of course, i 'm going to be adding in some garlic paste to the buzzer.
so just give that good mix around and guys what i 've got here is a turkish bread that i 've just sliced in half i love this stuff.
but you can use any sort of bread that you 're after so, what i want you to do just under the gorilla and toast it.
so without bread toasted.
i 'm just using a brush and i 'm just going to brush that bread with our garlic butter, and basil mixture so our garlic breads down.
it 's time now to serve this bad boy up just to finish it off.
i 've just got some fresh parsley just on the top there.
and of course, i 've served it with some pastor, so there.
you have it, i 've recreated my first ever dish that i gave you here on nickos kitchen.
