hey , there, what 's going on at least hirafu, for kids.
hope you 're having a super awesome day.
i sure am.
last couple days, she 's been keeping it real simple.
and i needed to make a video.
so i wanted to do something special for you.
so i thought of a vietnamese sandwich that is just awesome.
is very popular, i probably not pronouncing right?
so someone knows the crap pronunciation ban me.
i think it 's called you 'll know.
what it is when i start making it, but it 's a real traditional vietnamese sandwich.
an normally it 's got some kind of meat product in it or tofu or something.
but in this case, i 'm just going to stop the sandwich full of nice vegetables and everything.
so check this out.
typically , this vietnamese sandwiches got carrots in it if my store had dipan.
i would 've gotten carrots and icon but i 'm using carrots, i got some thinly sliced, radishes, avalo , mandolin.
but if you do n't have ninja slice all these really thin, the carrots shredded so nice thing.
i 've got a fresh mint.
fresh cilantro, those are the herbs and then for the sandwich part for my bread.
typically , it 's made with, like almost like a baguette bread.
but i thought, would work out really nice, and be a little more sturdy so we could really pack this full of vegetables and some sauce.
we 're going to make a chili lime mango sauce to go on it, you some napa cabbage.
so i got the napa cabbage in the ribs.
really , pretty i do n't know.
you do n't really want to eat, and they 're kind of hard.
so what i do is i just kind of chopped off the rip part, and i 'll say that for something else.
but this is going to be my sandwiches in by my bread here, and it 's nice and hardy.
let 's make the sauce person.
i 'm she had put together.
i mean, this is very simple.
the amounts, i mean, you just cut up as much vegetables as you want to put in your sandwich and the sauce here.
i 've got about a half of a really large mango if using little champagne or honey megas probably eat from one or two.
it depends on how much sashi like generally the condiments on the sandwich or mayonnaise chili, chili sauce is typically put on there.
so i thought to kind of make it like a chili sauce.
i do some a little bit of a fresno chile, so i 've got one of these is about the same, he does a holla, pina.
so , whatever pepper you want to the spiciness, i took out the ribs put that all in there instead, of using honey or god or anything i 'm going to use this mango as my sweetness and then the juice of a half along these lines have n't been very juicy.
so i 'm going to put in three force of a line, 'cause that 's what i 've got.
it 's really to taste.
you want the acidity to balance out the sweetness, you could also just do chili and lime in here and then just squeeze?
some , have a lot of lemon.
squeeze some lemon over top or some more lime.
this is going to be the sauce, and i wanted to be kinda thick the mango is going to make it really nice.
because again, when use all these vegetables and their full of water and everything you want something that 's going to stay on your sandwich alright.
so just pray this up done one more piece of mango did n't make it.
no pretty color.
i can smell that chili holy moly, encinas make sure i 'm not going to kill us oh, man i.
sipur , fick balance as awesome, oh, that 's really good.
so , check this out all you do eating healthy is very simple.
and you can eat great through this is fat, free, full of flavor.
you just want to take one of your bread here and fill it up carrots, but some carrots in there yeah, put some cucumber, some radishes here.
and i thought about maybe pick a ling.
some of the vegetables, but, you know, you could do that too, but i just wanted to do something quick and easy.
put some fresh mint in there.
the herbs going to give it such a nice flavor, though i check this out, so i 'm not look awesome that what am i missing.
i got that on there and then the sauce.
so , i think, that is good.
but then on their aunt man, true mama mia really that vietnamese sandwich matured top on their band, me.
that 's what i 'm calling.
i 'm probably pronouncing it wrong.
but that 's what i 'm gonna call.
and you could even cut this.
you wanted to let 's see, if i can, that he wants after dinner.
go get yourself some of these ingredients and put it together.
you doing put it together so that.
but it also, and take a bite totally hold together.
is it workout better?
and then romaine leaves or something like that is almost storium, omam delicious, a sauce, gives it such a good flavor, the herbs excellent.
but it 's tough it as big as you want, and as many of these, as you want.
hope you enjoy this one, remember always eating happy foods, having food to make, you feel good.
i just wanted to mention that jenn i 've been really working it hard at the gym lately.
and one thing that we notice is that we 're just pushing myself as hard as we can, with our muscles are fatigued at the end of the workout.
but we both notice that we have n't been that, sorry, i can only imagine that it 's from eating this way the fruits in the vegetable just helping to flush things out and keep you go and keep the recovery time down.
so that 's one thing that we both notice so into working out.
try to clean things up, get the raw foods in you because i 'm telling you, amazing, each day that we go to the gym, and more pushing it.
so i load, please describe these videos.
thank you so much for watching and leave me a comment.
