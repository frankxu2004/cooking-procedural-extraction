hi , i 'm, angie and say i 'm making a crock monsieur.
this is kind of a french style ham and cheese sandwich that 's dipped in egg.
this recipe is convenient because you prepare it the night before, and you want to refrigerate it overnight.
so this does take a little bit of advanced planning.
but it 's very easy to do the first thing.
i 've done is created the oven to three hundred fifty degrees because we 're going to toast the bread.
first , i got twelve slices of just regular white bread.
this is square sandwich bread.
i do n't usually use this.
but for this recipe, that 's what it 's called for.
so you just want to lay it out on your baking sheet.
it 's OK, if it overlaps we 're going to toast in a preheated oven for about twenty minutes, turning it over halfway through.
so i put this in the oven for twenty minutes, and then will continue on with the recipe OK, well, i 'm waiting for the other side of the bread to toast.
i 'm just going to lightly oil a nine by thirteen glass baking dish and some vegetable oil and we 're going to layer the bread with ham and cheese and then put an egg mixture over top and then put it in the refrigerator for eight hours or overnight OK in this measuring cup.
i 've got eight large eggs that i 've cracked.
i 'm going to whisk in two tablespoons of dijon mustard and two cups of two percent milk or half and half cream.
i had a teaspoon of salt, just whisk that altogether can i set that aside now in our nine by thirteen glass baking dish.
i 'm just going to layer six pieces of the toast, and you can kind of squish, it, in if you have to that 's pretty well an i 'll pour a third of the egg mixture evenly over top.
now i 'm going to lyrette with some cheese, i 'm going to use swiss cheese slices.
but you can use grated swiss cheese or shredded cheddar as well.
i love that cheddar for that piece and now i 've got about eight slices of thinly sliced ham, i 'm just going to lay that over two.
we 'll just cut it into thirds and now another cup of cheese.
so on top of that now, i 'll be using the grated cheddar, and.
now i 'll layer on the last six slices of bread, and you want to press firmly down on the bread.
get it in there.
and now i 'm going to pour the remaining egg mixture all over an one more cup of cheese sprinkled on top.
so now you just want to cover this and refrigerate it for eight hours, or overnight, after the eight hours, when you 're ready to bake the dish we want to take it out of the fridge and preheat your oven to three hundred fifty degrees and you 're going to bake this in the lower third of the oven, you want to bake it uncovered for about forty five minutes or until it 's golden on top.
so i 'll wait eight hours i 'll bake it, oufan i 'll show it to you when it 's done thanks for watching and i hope you try some crock monsieur bake.
