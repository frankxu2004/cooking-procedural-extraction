so i took a really lovely dish.
bergin jan classic, french beef stew, with lots of lovely things in the first thing you need is the chuck steaks is very important.
nice piece of beef like this now i need to trim it off of it.
so you want to get rid of the sinews, so just going to trim off the pieces that kind of breaks off in its natural seniors.
this is a really great cut of meat because it is quite reasonably priced.
it 's chuck so it 's very much.
kinda quite tough piece of meat and it 's got lots and lots of sorts in use in there.
it taste so good because you cook for a long, long time.
so all those kind of bits of fat and send you breakdown, and make it incredibly tender.
so in sort choppin slices.
so you 've got like two three centimeter cubes, and it seems it 's really sort of quite tough meat.
so it will take about three hours of cooking my mom used to make it the day before.
so that flavors sort of go through.
and the next day it will be even stronger and more delicious.
when you can eat it straight out of the oven once it 's been cooked.
but it 's actually better.
because i think i 've had six years old, actually menu and made these damage is sort of sandwich man it was in like two sandwiches on the menu.
but i kind of went out into the, into the garden that my parents have keen gardeners gardening and i would go with these two, two sandwiches on the menu, and then they were to choose one and pretend it was kinda big long menu.
so you can buy some flower onto the beef that will give it a nice for the colour and i was sort of thinking up the source slightly.
but first we 're going to get the smoke bacon.
so smoked bacon, and then just a little bit of olive oil in the pan.
so we get some oil thing goes a bacon.
so what i 'll do is try and get all at that fat out of the bacon.
so that the fat then sort of seasons the beef the basic up nice about a flower on it, just going to take it away from all that excess flour just such a slightly kated not too much it 'll just the source becomes too thick.
so take that off little bit of salt not too much does the bacon is quite sorted to make sure that all goes in together and then i 'm just going to pop that in the pan i want to get a nice bit of color in it OK.
so with nothing on those thoughts during the straight away.
because what happens all the flower will come off and the beef brown it will just go all sort of source often with oil in the pan.
so i care that can read board, and then this is where the chopping starts.
so we 've got some carrot some onion, i 'm going to pick up my son prime.
so in different life, different job, different knife feel again, and never have a sharp enough nine holster, and then just got the carrot instead of long strips that do n't worry about it too much i mean, thank, you know, some people spends hours, chopping vegetables to sort of perfect size.
but i went too much.
because it 's going to be cooking for a long time, skipping for three hours.
so it will be very well cooked.
so the carrots there for sort of sweetness onion carrot and celery and those kind of ingredients that will always brilliant in stews or soups.
because they had the natural sweetness to them if you do n't have them, it can taste a little bit, little bit bland.
so that 's our carrot onion he 's like this nice weather for that is, my mom 's recipe, i mean, it 's kind of, you know, the classic bruff bugging on, you know, will take kind of days to make you restrain everything, and it 's all kind of quite, quite precise this really is a sort of chuck in the oven, while not hope for the best is going to taste good.
but you check in the oven, wait three hours and, and eat it.
so it 's a bit of a foolproof recipe really and it 's something that, you know, my mother 's color very much cooks with our hearts.
so it was kind of that sort of style that, that 's why i cook with my R two.
but it 's that sort of way of cooking where it is quite sort of simple public garlic.
so we 're going to do.
we 're going to turn the beef over seven look at it.
so , so nice for the color on it now, and all that sort of fat from the bacon is all kind of gone and commented meets your that sort of salty smokiness.
what kind of flavor develop into the beef, and then with onion.
i think it is the onion and the carrots and then we just going to make sure that all guys are together and start sealing off this that says all kind of incorporated together in the onion and the carrot cooks that have garlic.
i 'm just going to shit, play with garlic in, and then now we have the herbs.
we got some, some time and a bit of bailey going to some of these potatoes.
i 'm also going to put one two in this shoe 'cause they 're lovely sort of depth of flavor limited time, feel that not too much of it put that in with a bay leaf and then now.
we had a little bit of tomato puree.
so little squirt of tomato puree and some chopped tomatoes.
that 's the tomatoes are chopped tomatoes, given.
i sir then penny red wine in a really nice good robust red wine.
much , most things, i was thinking quite a quite driver does a good, good choice so that 's the wine and then be stopped.
now you can buy beef.
stop you can revise stock.
use anything, but if you can be both make it makes such a difference.
but you could use chicken stock.
that 's fine OK, so we got pretty much everything in there now.
but the bay leaf, the beef everything and then we just kind of these little onions.
now normally traditionally that fry them often with little ladens of bacon.
so in go the little pearl onions give a really nice stir majors.
stud just enough liquid just sort of just sort of sitting.
it 's kind of covered in a bit more and then lid.
on you can always add a bit and liquid, if it seems a bit dry.
so we 're going to put in the oven for three hours at a hundred and seventy degrees hundred, six hundred seventy, if you feel is cooking.
down , a bit, and if it seems a bit dry, add a bit of stock.
but you need to cook it quite a long time 'cause chuck steak is quite tough.
right now it 's very important to actually let it rest.
so you want to get all the flavors to kind of the meat.
so tender you cut, cut it straight away.
little bit hot and thoughts.
and i say let it sort of rest of it, so let 's have a little taste sure so that should be really kind of really, really softer.
the pickup piece of meat you should just be able to break a fork and this is perfect.
and then it 's going to hum delicious taste just like my mom.
