alright , let 's make our marinade for chicken.
wings remember these are crispy wings anyway, because some black pepper some salt, some granulated garlic.
i really use that in the powder, but you can get better be fine, some cayenne pepper for a little bit of spice.
now i 'm going to put some hot sauce.
this is the vinegar based stuff you whatever brand, you like.
now we 're going to add or buttermilk call.
and then we 're going to give us a really good stir to mix everything up.
and then we 're going to pour a marinade over chicken.
we 're going to mix it up really good, and then we 're going to put it in refrigerator for about one hour.
you can go two hours, but i would not go over three marinade.
and we 're going to code are chicken with this season flower, do n't wash at buttermilk off?
just let it kind of drip off a little bit and then we 're going to get a nice thick, coated this flour mixture on here.
but we 're going to, we 're going to put it on this sheet pan, and we 're going to let him sit for about ten minutes, and after about ten minutes are going to look like this see how you got some dry spots and some wet spots like right there.
you get a witch.
but anyway, we 're going to take care of that right.
now and all we 're going to do is we 're going to put these things back into flower.
this is the same flower that we were using before now, whenever i get done doing this part.
i 'm gonna throw that flower way.
i do n't want to save it because it 's had rob chicken in alright.
i 'm going to test my oil.
i put a little piece of flower in there, it looks good.
i want a nice gentle fry on this, first, try as a lot of fries hidden, yeah, anyway, if i had at the monitor i 'd be looking for about three hundred and forty F.
no , as soon as i get some color on both sides of this chick in the colour of just about, like that, i will take it out and put it on the wire rack.
and then i 'll start on the next batch alright.
my last batch is done and what i will do when i get these out as i 'm going to crank the heat up to three seventy five F and.
now that the oil is up to second fry attempt.
we 're going to put our first batch of wings back into the oil now that we have this batch of wings in the oil.
we 're going to keep staring him around.
i do n't want on the set on the bottom, because if they do they 'll get black spots on.
and i want him to have a nice pretty golden brown color, all the way around, and then when are wings get nice and crispy and golden brown 's just about like that we 're going to pull him out and put him back on the wire rack.
now do n't those look good, nice and crispy, nice and hot little bit spicy, as always, how does it take.
one thing is hot.
i feel it in my fingers crunchy.
so a little bit of heat not hot not grow spicy that depends on your spice level.
but this thing is loaded with flavor.
it 's moist, absolutely wonderful.
please give us a truck.
