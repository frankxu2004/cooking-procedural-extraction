yeah , the third software, if i have a two chicken breasts cut into small chunks in a ball we going to make a marinade for these by using a tablespoon of some sort source big data spoon and if you 've got some chinese rice wine or dry sherry that will do my mom always use up studies that tablespoon of that, well, my mom always use dry sherry that have chinese rice wine if you can find it, and we 're going to use about then of corn flour or cornstarch we 're just going to mix that all together and leave it to one side, throwing that many ingredients actually in the fish, we have.
garlic ginger dried red chilies roasted.
peanuts , corn flour and some swear sources for the source and spring onions.
i 'm cutting my red chillies in half and taking the seeds out because there are a lot of them in this and take them out.
and if i did n't take the seeds out this digital, probably blow my head off slice will spring onions up too quick.
we 've got two small better math.
it 's actually really important to get all your ingredients ready first before you start cooking so all micro spring onions.
and garlic ginger is chopped my chicken is marinating all i 've got to do.
now is put together all the kind of source ingredients into one bowl.
so that it 's ready to throw in at the right time.
source ingredients are couple more tablespoons of soy source area.
i will put all the quantities up in my blog for you, you want a teaspoon of some chinese, yeah, which is like black.
the black one if you do n't have, it just use balsamic as a substitute.
he 's been a sugar couple of tablespoons of water.
and this helps make it more sources teaspoon of corn.
flour , so mixed together.
that 's all that go in the source.
we are now ready to cook about my work on that something, i can get it poppin T devil spoons, if of some clean will round up and i would like to add a dash of sesame E seed oil to this, as well, it 's not essential.
any work a little bit chilly is going in now put in the chili thing first, actually health just flavor the oil of it now.
my chickens going in the heats not too high and obviously we do n't want everything to burn while the chicken is cooking once the chick in round all over will turn white like this.
then we could add dialect.
kinda came up most of the spring onion save some of them keep some of them back the sprinkling on later, and your thoughts.
just keep staring until everything is nicely coated and cooked through you see how the corn flour makes a really nice sticky source, left serve the chicken up on a bed of steamed white rice.
