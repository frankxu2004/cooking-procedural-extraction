hi , this is dorado with foods, one oh, one, and today we 're making chicken kabobs.
we 're going to the grill today, so here i got one pound of chicken now.
these are just chicken tenders that i cleaned.
i patted dry, and i put here in a dish that we 're going to use to marinate these chicken tenders in.
i 've got a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil here.
a fourth of a cup of soy sauce.
i have one tablespoon, mince garlic, i have one tablespoon of light brown sugar.
i 've got peppercorns right here in the bottom as you can see those little peppercorns.
it 's going to give the chicken a lot of flavor and also, we 're going to acidic with a fresh lemon back here are the skewers.
we 're going to add the chick in and the vegetables.
too you see, there 's like a little sharp point there, you just add your chick in on to here now, if you do n't have these you can also use these bamboo skewers and these bamboo skewers, you probably want to soak in water for about thirty minutes, start threading your chick in and your vegetables on it for the grill.
because you do n't want to burn.
now back here i 've got red peppers.
i 've got yellow peppers are going to vie, dalea onion, an if you 'd like, to add mushrooms or pineapples to your chicken kabobs that would be fine.
but let 's get this marinated, started.
so we can get this back in the refrigerator.
because we 're going to let this chicken marinate for about two three hours.
so here we 're going to add the garlic.
the soy sauce the olive oil and your brown sugar and pepper courts.
now , the brown sugars in there.
so when you put it on the grill, you can get a little bit of carmel ization on your chicken as it 's grilling.
you want to mix these ingredients very well, together.
and then you 're going to go ahead and pull him right over here on your chicken tenders.
yeah , you can do this by chicken breasts and cut it into bite size pieces.
this is going to go back in the refrigerator i forgot to add my lemon, so let 's go back here.
and i just kept my limited to here, and you can just take a for stick it in there moving around and giving a nice little squeeze.
you wo n't have to worry about the seeds getting into your marinating sauce here.
all right now we 're just going to go ahead move the chicken tenders around.
so we can get that marination on all sides of the chicken tenders and wood.
these are going to be yummy, and as a matter fact that could measure i 'm just going to go ahead.
and i 'm going to add this other lemon this other fresh lemon, right in.
here the chicken nothing better than women and chicken together.
so one of my favorite things with a little bit of garlic, and it will just move him around yeah, try to put your limit into your sauce before you pour it over the chicken.
but if you forget like i just did no big deal alright now these are going to go covered just take some plastic cover.
it up goes back in the refrigerator for a good two to three hours and make sure its covered very well, and i 'll come back and i 'll show you how to cut up vegetables i am going to cut up a red bell pepper, a nice sweet, red, bell pepper and as you know, there 's males and females when it comes to the bell pepper world, the mail bell pepper has four sections as you can see.
whereas the female which is the yellow bell pepper here only has three.
the females with three sections sweeter like in salads or sauteing, where your mail bell peppers hold up a little better with high heats.
so i 'm gonna go ahead.
cat these into bite size pieces as you can see.
and i 'm going to add.
this , by alternating with the chick in on two hour kabobs.
now i 've decided that i am using a bamboo skewer, so we 're going to just get these in bite sized, pieces, i have a videl.
ya sweet onion here just going to cut it in half like this.
well , then we 're going to get it this way and then this way and pull out that outer layer of skin.
my slayer pill back and then we 're going to do is we 're going to cut these into you just get this out of the way and we 're going to cut these intersections, do four sections and put him over here in our boat right now?
i 'm going to cut up the yellow bell pepper, and then i 'm just going to go ahead and add this to our bowl as well, now.
if you want to add mushrooms or anything else.
that 's great, but i 'm also adding a little sweetness of pineapples to our kabobs.
we put that in there.
and the reason that i 'm putting all this in a bow is because i 'm going to drizzle, it was a little olive oil and that way.
it 'll keep it.
nice and fresh and keep it from burning.
here , i go little olive oil.
and we 're just going to go ahead and add a little bit of kosher salt and a little bit of fresh cracked pepper and give it a toss alright.
just gonna give it a toss and now.
i 'm going to go over here.
and tear those, apart i 'm going to go over here in the refrigerator, and i 'm going to get the chicken.
and we 're going to alternate the chicken and the vegetables here on our scooters.
alright would it looks lovely.
i 'll be back.
but i 've taken my chick in that 's been marinating for about four hours out of the refrigerator and the best way to get your chick in and your bell peppers and onions on the skewers is just add a piece chicken.
first , you just going to thread it on as you can see.
i threaded on since i 've got tenders like this go through it and you can see who, and that 's going to be a lovely piece of chicken to punch into, and then i 'm just going to add onions, put your skewer right into their slide up.
now in all reality.
i like to use two skewers together that way when you put these on the grill.
they 're not going to roll around on you, but today, i 'm limited on my skewers, so i 'm just adding.
i 'm just using one alright now do n't jam your vegetables in your.
chickens , really close, together that way you 'll have a little room in between to wear your vegetables in your chicken can cook.
so i 'm doing a chicken tender.
i 'm doing the onion.
red bell pepper yellow bell pepper.
and then i 'm just going to thread on another chicken tender.
i 've got my onion, then i 'm going to go for a red pepper, and then it 's yellow.
the smell so good what we 've marinating.
the chicken in, and then also in the end, i 'm just going to polish it off with a couple of pineapples that way we can have a little sweetness with our chicken and are bell peppers and onions.
all right look how beautiful that is chick in onions.
red bell pepper yellow bell pepper.
and then we got chicken and onion red bell pepper yellow bell pepper, and you got your little pineapples and then we 'll come over here on a cookie sheet here 's our chicken kabobs ready to go on a grill on medium high heat for the.
