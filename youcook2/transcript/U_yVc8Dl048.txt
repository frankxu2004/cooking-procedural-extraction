today is an exciting day in take out at home week.
i 'm making chinese food one of my favourites, and guess what it 's going to be hot.
and sour soup did you ever even think about making that involved well, now you can think about it because it 's really easy.
i 'm just getting all my ingredients ready.
i 'm starting by slicing three scallions.
the white, and the green parts.
three quarters of a cup of drained canned bamboo shoots.
i suppose if you had access to we use that.
but that 's not too common is n't cut them up into julienne, the great thing about hot and sour soup is it seems like a really complex soup.
but it 's actually very simple to make the main flavoring ingredients are white peppers to make.
sure , you have white pepper and shit talky mushroom and here 's where the real flavor comes in one ounce of shit talky mushrooms, these were dry.
these were previously dry.
they look like this when they 're dry.
so one ounce of those in one and a half cups of boiling water and what you get are these created almost like knew mushrooms, squeeze out the liquid.
cute , cute, is so important when you 're making hot and sour soup?
do n't you agree?
and that 's it.
everything is ready to go time to cook.
i have five cups of chicken stock in here so that i 'm going to add my mushrooms that i 've chopped up.
also , the mushroom liquid i did n't add them back together again.
'cause i want to pour the mushroom liquid off of any grit that might be in the bottom of the bowl, you can also straight.
but i like to live life on the edge so let 's see, how this goes for me leave the sediment in the bottom four tablespoons of soy sauce.
i should measure this just for safety.
no , i do n't like measuring things for type.
this was low sodium soy sauce.
you could use either and a teaspoon of white pepper that 's where the hot cups from hot and sour soup, the hot comes from white pepper simmer.
this , for about five minutes, just so the flavors combine i like my stirring utensil.
yeah , once it comes to a simmer, you can add the rest of your ingredients.
the scallions saving about four tablespoons of the green part for garnish bamboo shoots and the tofu.
then you just need to let everything simmer together, basically, you 're just leaving everything through it 's december for five minutes, i 'm going to get my thick and already a cornstarch slurry.
i do n't know if you 've ever used a cornstarch slurry before.
have we if you like this might be the first time?
it 's a combination of water and cornstarch that you mix together four tablespoons of cold water and two tablespoons of cornstarch.
what you 're going to do is wisc your cornstarch into cold water.
make sure the water is cold.
if it 's boiling water, the cornstarch will lump up immediately.
basically activate the thickening.
and then it wo n't thinking anything you 'll just have a bunch of lunch, so is it cold water.
or it could be chicken stock called chicken stuff works fine to whisk it, and the cornstarch will dissolve right away.
whisk the slurry into the hot soup as it 's simmering.
make sure that you 're whisking the whole time.
make sure you continue whisking.
if you just put it in there, it will also lump up kind of like what i was saying before about adding the cornstarch to hot liquid, you can see that it 's completely thickening already just bring it back to a boil for the cornstarch to completely activate.
now you 're really, really close to done.
the last thing that goes well, there are two last things vinegar to make it sour an egg to make those strands that you always see in soup.
so i 'm going to get the egg ready.
we are ready people.
as you can see my cornstarch is completely activated because the liquid is at a boil.
make sure that you can bring it to a boil.
otherwise , it might taste starchy.
follow my lead.
now you season it.
let 's see, does it need salt.
it may not need salt, but it may maybe a tiny bit.
and then vinegar three tablespoons of white vinegar.
i 'm going to start with two tablespoons and then add the third.
i 'd like to see if it needs.
it does n't always need it to give it a test.
maybe a half tablespoon more.
yeah , i 'm going over the whole thing.
do it to your taste, so start your steering and then pour in your egg?
and that should make nice long strands in the soup, do n't over stir it?
otherwise , it turns into scrambled eggs, and you 're done.
it was n't that easy can sprinkle with the rest of your scallion greens and only you were here.
you think you were in a chinese restaurant really easy.
no special ingredients undof authentic flavor and super fast it spicy.
it 's hot and sour soup made at home easier than take out, make it tonight, i demand it.
