hey there and welcome back to all things.
tasty today, we 're going to be making new england clam chowder.
it 's one of our favorite things to make.
we think we are pretty good recipe.
so cook along with us and let 's get going here about ten pounds, or about thirty hard shell clams.
we dug these ourselves there called quahogs or chowder, clams, if you ca n't get him yourself.
get them from your fish market or supermarket, there, inexpensive.
or you can use canned clams.
they work just fine.
russet potatoes russets are perfect for chatter.
they have a lot of starch and they help picking up the broth.
we have onions.
we have some celery.
we 're going to use a couple of weeks just as we had them.
and we like them here.
is some salt pork very traditional in new england clam chowder?
you can use bacon, or you can leave out both.
so let 's get going new england clam chowder, i really think you 're going to like making this recipe.
OK , the first step is to get arc lamp steam valve.
so i just use a little brush and clean them up.
they were pretty clean, so i gave a quick scrub, i have two pots.
i probably have about five pounds in each.
so i want to make sure that they steam open.
evenly , i 'm going to pluck them out as they open will probably take about fifteen minutes.
so we 're going to get these on the stove.
here 's one that i found in the batch that was cracked so we 're going to discard it but let 's get these going to put a tight lid on i have about a quarter inch of water look at these under stove to steam.
OK the clones have going.
for about ten minutes.
so , let 's give him a peak here.
that 's trying to open.
so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to take some toms.
here , and a bowl.
and i 'm going to just remove them.
one by one as they open here 's one that 's open you can see.
so you can wait for them to open all the way.
but i think that cook some a little too much, so i try to get him just as their opening and let them cool down.
so , let 's take these guys out there.
still , some that are unopened and they 're probably open as i 'm taking these guys out, the claims are all steamed up again.
about five minutes to cool off, so, let 's just get the meat out here.
i 've already started as you can see.
we have a ton of meat here.
we have about a pound and a half of meat that have come off these clamps.
i have reserved the broth in the pot on the stove that 's going to be the basis of the cheddar.
so make sure you save that there really is very little sand in this broth, so we 're going to strain it just to be safe.
but it 's absolutely perfect.
another thing to take a look at it.
look at how nice the inside of these clamshells are there beautiful.
they have border on it.
so you might want to save some of these for some kids projects, i 'm just going to leave these in the sink will discard those later.
so , let 's finish up cleaning these here 's one other tip.
if some of them, especially the bigger ones, have an open all the way, just use a clam knife.
you can use a butter knife to help you pry them open.
but this is going to be loaded look at the size of the meeting this one, so, let 's finish up.
keep all these juices in with the clamps.
and we 're going to be ready to assemble the chowder.
OK , the claims were all cleaned up.
here 's the broader we gotta look at our nice distance we have about half a gallon of broth.
it 's perfectly clear of sand.
i just had to strain it a little bit, actually.
most of the sandwich was very little skittish bottom of the pot, so we 're going to reserve that tasted.
it 's absolutely delicious.
it tastes just like, just like seawater.
so where rendering off some salt pork put it in the freezer for about five minutes to help firm it up, and makes it a lot easier to cut just like bacon when it gets room temperature.
it 's hard to slice so tip.
we 're going to get this, uh, rendered offer about fifteen minutes.
we 're using a cast iron pot.
if you do n't have one of these, just use a big, a big pot.
this is going to be used to assemble chowder.
i 'm going to start cutting up vegetables here and then we 're going to remove the rendered softcore.
use the, the oil to saute the veggies.
and we 're going to be on our way.
here 's the salt pork that 's been rendered down.
it looks like bacon, but it 's really, really salty you can give it a taste, but it 's not something you 'd want to eat.
like , like bacon bits, we 're going to, uh, put this back into the chatter at the end, chop it up a little more finally and this will be a big portion of our salt that 's needed that and the clams, you so, before you add extra salt to chowder make sure your taste everything so, here are veggies with chop.
we have about two whole onions, large ones about five stocks of celery chopped uniformly as best as you can do.
you do n't have to be perfect.
leaks are really cool there in the onion family, but you have to be careful.
i just use the white here discarded the green.
so what you want to do is make sure that you rinse them really well.
a lot of lives between the layers here, so, let 's just chop those up.
i 'm going to go this way first.
about three times and then just run across with my knife with the leaks, and we 're just going to saute up our veggies that will take about five to ten minutes to saute these up.
you do n't want to get them brown, just want to make them translucent and then we 're going to keep going, i have my potatoes reserved here.
so while these are sauteing i 'm going to cuba up, my potatoes here 's, here 's a whole potato.
this is the russet.
we 're going to cut these in half and then make probably about, about half inch squares, which add a nice texture.
OK , the veggies are started off, took about ten minutes to get them translucent.
we 're going to and now work on thickening the finish chowder.
we do n't like a really thick new england chatter.
in fact, ours is kind of a mix between a stew and a chowder.
but we are going to make a little bit of aroo, aroo is a mixture of a fat.
we had some fat from the salt work, in.
here we 're going to add a little, little bit of butter in about a quarter stick in total might seem like a lot now.
but this is really a low fat version of chowder.
so we 're going to put that in and a root is a mix of fat, and some flowers.
so we 're going to add in a little bit of flour mix this in with the veggie still in here and that 's going to be the basis to thicken up this chowder OK looking really good.
so the flower is a mixing into the room here in just cooking off a little bit, you do n't want to brown it we do n't like a chatter that 's too thick.
so we just used about three tablespoons of flour to about a quarter stick of butter.
so we 're going to let that go for a little bit longer, you heard me buzzing here this is our secret weapon this is a spice, spice grinder, and what we have in here is white, pepper white peppercorns, if you have n't had them you gotta give, give these things, smell their very unique much different than black pepper they actually smell like almost like a barnyard.
but they had a really unique flavoring are perfect in chowder we also have some coriander seed about a half teaspoon of coriander seed and also a half teaspoon of fennel seed, along with about a full teaspoon of the white pepper corn.
so we used our spice grinder here you could also use a mortar and pestle, mortar and pestles are great tool to have we just wanted to use a special order 'cause we had it.
but brining it up in a mortar and pestle is great , too.
so we 're going to add just a little pinch of, i mean, you really have to smell this of this secret blend into our veggies.
here we 're going to mix these together, and then we 're going to add our broth, so here 's our broth.
as you can see it 's about a half gallon.
we 're going to pour that into the veggie, seer there on low heat right now and we 're going to cook that down.
and then we 're going to add up potatoes and clamps.
we added the potatoes and also the salt pork, which we chop back up a little more finely.
and we also chopped up arc lamps as you can see.
we have a ton of clamps here.
we have got two pounds of clamps.
we kept them chunky.
there 's nothing worse than a clam chowder where you, where you do n't taste the clamps.
we also took the twenty minutes that this has been simmering with potatoes to clean up the kitchen.
so we really do n't have any work to do there.
so what we 're going to do now is use what 's called an emergen blender.
some people called the boat motor, but really handy to use.
and it 's going to help us thicken up our chowder without adding extra fat, or in the case of flower too much flour.
so the potatoes themselves are going to be matched up here, and they 're going to help thicken the broth, so, let 's give this a try.
and , as you can see.
and i could see it thickening up as we go.
so the potatoes are breaking down.
and you 're just going to buzz this thirty seconds and see what it looks like the immersion blender work.
we have just the right consistency of chatter at this point.
there 's still plenty of chunks in.
here we have n't had the clams in which is our next step, but now, would be a great time to check for seasoning?
we did give it a taste and were perfect, unsal.
we have n't added any extra salt.
the salt from the salt pork an from the clam liquor itself is just right what we did.
notice was we could use a little bit more kicks.
so we 're going to use tiny pinch of our seasoning special seasoning here with the white pepper, the coriander seeds general that we ground up, and.
now we 're going to add in two cups of whole milk.
we 're also going to finish the chowder when everything is done with about one cup of heavy cream that is, actually really light for new england clam chowder, so.
let 's put in the whole milk and will start that in.
and this will also help thicken up the chatter at this point.
we 're going to do that, and we 're going to add in our clams and cook this, bring this up to a boil for about five minutes, turn off the heat and finish it with the cream and will be ready to serve.
so we turned up the heat.
we start in our heavy cream.
we remove the bay leaves and we 're ready to serve as always.
it was really fun to make clam chowder.
we love doing.
and as you can see we have nice hall here.
we have over a gallon, which this, too, long we eat it the day of the day afterwards, even better in the day.
after that words, still better.
but we can also freeze some.
it freezes really, really nicely.
so give it a try dish.
some up here, here 's the consistency you could see tons of chunks of clams get still the nice bite of the potato going to serve this with some oyster crackers.
