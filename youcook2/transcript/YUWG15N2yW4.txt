hello , guys, this is a theater from the german restaurant spider.
come out in power meter paper disrupt customers is the national.
what is the fault line or you can also do the field, we were at it and then we for tevin campbell hour.
so that 's what i 'm going to do today?
so enjoy it, and hopefully, ella.
so , first we gonna start with the pork loin.
what we have right here.
it 's already cleaned, and cut it actually not pork loin.
it is from the area.
but it 's a very nice and tender and very tasty alone thinking anyway at the very end tender meat at the park have left.
so that 's how we call it, you put that on plastic wrap like this, and then you rap it over on the other side like this, and then you left off just like that.
do n't have it too much?
you do n't want to get any holes in it.
but you wanna make it night and fled and around this sickness, what it maybe a quarter inch or so all right and now we can leave that here.
and we start preparing the bread.
let me first.
you 're going to need a little flower, then we need the breading.
dry white bread, preferable some kind of rolls you can pretty much get me, there needs to be wild.
and then we 're going to get a couple of errors.
you probably need only one, but we just going to use two today hope.
are you busy, with you 're with it up, put it in a larger contina and then the way we 're going to start it is, we 're going to put it in flour first, very likely and then we 're going to put it in the egg like this?
i 'm going to put in the bread now, what i like to do.
now i 'd like to add a little thought to it and peppered what i need to get a little pepper.
i like black pepper a lot of people like white paper for it, but i like the black pepper.
i like the flavor of it now.
we 're going to put in the breading, turn it around a little bit.
take a little of the breading and then very lightly press on, press on the white bread, crumbs just like that, turn it around a couple of times.
all with a little method, but that 's how it works.
so and now we got a knife.
schnitzel , breaded and now we 're going to go over to the stove and cook it in color.
now , now, we 're going to cook the smithville.
you come all oil, and that a nice large pan with roughly a quarter inch of canola oil and needs to have a lot of oil kind of deep fried not really fried.
but not pan fry to deep fried.
however you want to call it.
but that 's probably the best way to do it, you get a knife and hot not too hard.
but it needs to be nicer when you put it in needs to start bonding right away just like it does here and then we got.
so we put into all start bubbling.
and peace located roughly for one minute, one minute on each side needs to get nice and brown and christy.
and it started already right over here.
turn it on.
i 'm going to look at it and see that it looks nice the heat.
we need, we need to have a lot of heat.
obviously , that 's the commercials open but at home, you can adjust the heat over three two.
make it nice and hard and now it 's having a nice.
color golden brown, several around one minute, i get.
now we 're going to turn it around home limit, and then we 're almost there, almost there may be another thirty seconds.
and then we have our famous venus network from that way the camel restaurant in our need.
so , that 's a perfectly cook venus, and into the right there golden color night in crispy and.
but what i like to do the little oil i like to.
i like to just touch it up lightly, but do n't press it too.
much needs to be needs to stay night with you.
and you do n't want to get rid of the breading, the way we serve that is, we can serve as a lot of things we can serve it with spetzler, the german pastor medical cables, roasted potato french fries, and a lot of different things we probably going to do that the.
next time we 're going to make some german roasted potatoes.
but what we like to do with it what is really good.
is we serve it with a couple of lemon slice, and there you go and that our wiener, schnitzel, and what like to do if he did just like that hear me?
