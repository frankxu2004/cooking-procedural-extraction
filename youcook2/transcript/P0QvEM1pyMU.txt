i am chef keith snow, welcome to my kitchen want to show you how you can make your own grilled chicken.
caesar salads very easy.
the first step is to get our chicken grilling and get our grill.
nice and hot here, and in this bowl is one chicken breast.
first thing to do is take the juice of a half of lemon, and you obviously could let this marinate a little bit.
but you do n't really need to a little bit of extra virgin olive oil.
some black pepper, quite a bit of black pepper and then some kosher salt.
we take our tongues and just make sure that this chicken breast get seasoned and sort of marinated all the way around, and the reason, you would n't want to let this sit is.
that 's lemon juice.
it will start to cook the chicken so our grill is nice and hot.
will take this chicken breast?
get it right on.
and now this i 'll let cook and then will pay attention to the rest of our salad, so here is our lettuce.
and this is organic romaine lettuce.
and romain is definitely the kind you want to use for caesar because it has good christmas.
so what will do here.
is we 'll take our bowl and usually this is just torn?
you do n't really need to use a knife to cut it up just tear it up with your hands.
the other thing i would say is when you 're making a caesar salad.
you surely want your serving plate to be very cold.
because there 's nothing worse than warm caesar salad, the biggest reason i do n't order it in most restaurants.
because i 've had it come out to main warm, too many times and i 'm just picky about cold salad and also you want to make sure your greens are chilled as well we 're going to take our caesar salad dressing for the whole thing, right, over the top, it 's about a quarter cup.
we 're going to take a little bit of our parmesan cheese.
not the whole thing, and get that in there.
and then i am going to reach right here and take two spoons, and start tossing this trying to get all of the greens coded in the caesar mix KR chicken, is done?
so we 're going to take it off.
you see, i developed some nice carmelization on the chicken.
give it beautiful flavor, so from this point going to grab quick fork, and you want to slice this into strips.
so let me grab my tossed salad, and i 'll put a nice big pile.
the center of our plate just like that, and then we 're going to take our chick in which is pretty hot, put that right, over the top.
we do n't need all of that, and then i garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese and of course are crunchy.
and there is chicken caesar salad that you can be proud of make that one today harvest eating dot com, the only social network website on the internet dedicated to seasonal local, an organic foods view, hundreds of recipe instruction videos hosted by chef keith snow, a nationally recognized expert in seasonal cooking , all.
