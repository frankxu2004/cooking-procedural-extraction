OK , so i have my stock pot here.
and what i 'm going to do is pour this entire bottle of coconut amino acid, which is like if you do n't have soy sauce, i 'd like to use this.
or you can use this soy sauce.
it 's a lot better type of soy sauce.
so i 'm going to make my stock.
and for this in the pot, you can add like a little bit of vegetable broth.
if you want an, i 'm going to fill it up with water as well, so i pour the amino acid coconut soy sauce in there.
an i kind of have the heat up on medium high, and i 'm going to pour self like a bottle and a half of the coconut amino acid.
so this like a sixteen ounces, so i 'm going to feel this up with water in add water to this, as well.
so i just feel this bottle of water, and i 'm going to put like maybe a couple of tablespoons of fish sauce in the mic not too much.
and i 'm going to let this i 'm going to bring this to a boil.
maybe i 'll probably add about.
maybe a couple of cups more.
water , so i 'm going to bring this to a boil.
and then i 'm going to reduce the heat.
OK , so i pretty much feel the particle water.
i have the heat on medium high i'ma, put a lid on it.
so i 'm gonna let this boil for about you know, until it comes to a full boil.
so that should take.
about maybe ten minutes, or so, and then i 'm going to reduce the heat.
OK , it is come to a full boil, so i 'm going to turn this down really.

for about thirty minutes, and then i 'm going to add my noodles and my bok, choy.
OK , so my sauce has been boiling for about or, simmering for about an hour so here, are my noodles?
and we 're changing camera hands here.
so i 'm going to just dump these in here is quite a few of us.
so and then you get a spoon to kinda just push those in here at the family loves the owner noodle.
so i use i 'm using two eight ounce package.
and , i 'm not sure i think this might be like a five quart stock pot.
so , i mean, of course, you do n't have to put as much as i 'm doing.

so what i 'm going to do is turn the heat back up to like about medium high so that i can get another boil coin.
and i 'm going to cover.
this , and then i 'm going to add my bok, choy writing for a right before i serve it, OK.
so my noodles are done you do n't know, you 're not trying to like cooking custom.
so here 's my bok, choy daytime.
just nothing special dumping it all in there may be some baby box.
you away, so you do n't have to like cook, the bok, choy just kind of letting the seasoning of the, the broth get in there and sprinkle a little bit of some real salt over the top pink salt, which is great, all your salt should have color in it.
so smells great quick and easy meal, an i 'll let this simmer for about five minutes, and it will be ready to serve up.
