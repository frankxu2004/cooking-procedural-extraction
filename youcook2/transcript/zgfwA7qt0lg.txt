three reasons why you should make your own sour crowded home number one.
it is super cheap.
number two is really easy and number three it is extremely good for you, let 's go make it not much to see here.
probiotics are a total buzzword right now and that 's basically.
what 's in sauerkraut, sauerkraut like the old school pro biotic.
it 's got tons of good bacteria in it, which is great for your god really good for digestion.
and it 's also like giving your vegetables superpowers, so we 're going to start out by chopping up our cabbage.
i 'm actually going to put an apron on for this because it can get a little messy and also this is a borrowed dress.
so , so, we will chop the cabbage in half.
first , so, once you have it in half basically we 're just going to go around the core cut it in little wedges.
i try to get it as soon as i can.
this is not have to be perfect cabbage is a great source of vitamin.
A and C really high in fiber.
that 's a great thing to eat on its own and even better when you ferment it.
so that 's what we 're doing today.
so at this point we 're going to put our cabbage in a bowl to massage it up.
i like to do half at a time and half of my salt, which is going to be about a tablespoon, kosher salt.
get that on there.
and then we 're just going to massage like the dickens.
so what we 're doing is, we 're massage ing it is basically pulling the water out.
this is starting the whole fermentation process, which is going to create this brine which is what creates the souring and the fermentation process.
the salt actually keeps it crunchy.
after you 've let it ferment for a few days, so that 's good.
you do n't want soggy crowd and were right.
let 's add the other half this process is actually really easy, and it 's such a cheap thing to make that.
once you do it once you want to make it all the time.
it 's also very therapeutic.
squeeze out all your problems.
so it will probably take about five to ten minutes of massage ing to draw the water out.
start to break it down, you should be pretty good to go after five to ten minutes.
there 's a point when you can get really creative, and add some extra veggies in there.
i 'm going to add beats because i just really love the color and adding a ton of nutrition vitamin, A vitamin C more fiber, all that stuff.
i 'm shredding it with a box grater.
because we want it broke him down a bit more.
so that it can be fully incorporated in with all the cabbage and we can massage it all in together.
and it 's going to be beautiful, which is important OK that looks great.
that 's plenty now for some extra flavor.
i 'm going to add in some juniper berries you could also add caraway seeds.
that 's i think the most common one or coriander seeds.
but i love juniper berries.
it 's like a small handful a couple of tablespoons and now i 'm just going to incorporate everything.
just massage it all together, yeah, an even since i 've left, the cabbage sitting here on its own more liquid has come out.
i can already feel it so it 's happening now, all we have to do is put it into a jar.
they sell containers that are specifically for making sauerkraut.
but you can just as easily use something that you probably already have at home.
i 'm going to use this jar, and he sort of like mason jar will work just make sure it 's nice and clean.
there 's no soap residue.
nothing like that because we really want the good bacteria in here to thrive just grab some.
i like this part and smoosh it in oh god that color smooth ship, oh, it 's so liquidy and wonderful.
so basically we 're just grabbing this stuff by the handful, punching it down.
and do it all over.
again , you can see how much liquid is coming out of here.
and that is all just from assault this awesome purple red color.
so it 's going to be important that when we leave it to ferment that the liquid is above the top of the sauerkraut that keeps it from going bad i am actually just going to pour some of this liquid , straight.
it now, if you 're out of liquid at this point, and you still have some crowd that 's popping up you can just add a little bit of water to make sure that it 's covered the other thing.
we 're going to do is at a weight on top.
so i 'm going to use little jelly jar.
i 'm going to put some beans in it you could also use a rock.
some people do that anything that will weigh it down.
that 's clean is going to keep the crowd from rising up to the water line to the crowd juice line.
oh , man, what do that?
so that 's great.
and now i 'm just going to cover it with some cheese cloth and hold it in place with a rubber band, you can use twine whenever you have on hand now.
we have our crowd all set up.
we 're going to find a nice cool place for it somewhere between sixty five and seventy five degrees is perfect.
and we 're just going to let it hang out.
you want to check on it every day or so just to make sure that the crowd has not crept up above the water line.
if that happens going to add a little water.
add a little weight.
maybe just gotta keep that liquid line above the crowd there 's no hard and fast rule about when it 's done.
you want to check on it after about three days and taste it just to see if it 's to your liking depends on how tangy you like it, you can let it go for a couple.
more days here you can keep it in the refrigerator for up to two months.
although you would definitely eat it all before, then grade on sandwiches just a really easy delicious way to incorporate probiotics into your diet.
so the cheapest way to do it, which is my personal favorite.
next week on raw vegan, not gross were making coconut chilli slice with a special guest.
