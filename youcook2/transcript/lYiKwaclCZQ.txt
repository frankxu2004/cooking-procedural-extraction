this traditional malaysian dish is an absolute treat.
this malaysian curry involves our very own spice blend to start off with made macadamia nuts.
more like a pesto, it marinate, prawns.
we 're going to look at some muscles in coconut milk and serve it with some hard, boiled eggs, lower website going on.
then , lots of flavor but actually quite quick dish excellent start with the paste we 've got ginger and garlic.
if you can peel, or anyone.
but that much ginger, both cloves of garlic i 'm going to do the same with charlotte, chili and lemon grass, all those ingredients, into a blender and make the case with some fish source, some oil and lyrics on paper.
so this is a pretty standard combination.
but we 're also going to add macadamia nuts in the same way.
you might add pine nuts into pesto makes quite grainy paste.
all these flavors can go in macadamia nuts.
please , do thank you even better roasted?
as they are to help blend it a little bit of oil, oil groundnut oil.
but anything that you can fly at high temperatures and some fish source later on and make our pace plug it in you would n't think we 've been doing this for a few years with little to make a paste there.
we go now half of this place.
we 're going to use to marinate our problems longer.
you can do this ahead of cooking time.
the better they can have this time overnight.
it 's not essential.
you can just miss those all in there.
the other half will cook off straight away in the walk in just a moment and this just intensifies the flavor of the prompts.
and going last minute and force them to a rubbery overcooked when you get that fresh flavor from the paste as well as that, which would cooked out also we need to cook off some eggs.
so hard boiled eggs cut up and put inside of the laxer for these can go into there.
and they need about seven or eight minutes.
so just shy of hard boiled in the mean time in the mean time.
we can heat up a walk shot of oil and start with the rest of our paste that all goes into our walk, suddenly stop coming together really quickly.
now it 's quite quick.
but we need to put our muscles that will take awhile director.
still cooking so it 's not it 's not as quick as a stir fried.
pretty , pretty speedy food, we added to work a little bit curry powder half a chicken stock cube.
because we 're going to add in some chicken stock water, really smell in a good way.
yeah , yeah, in a good way fish source, the lemongrass coming through all of the coconut milk and go in there as well, so these are fresh mussels.
all we 've done is wash them, depended them check their old still alive, but the fact they close up, depleted them shaping killcreek shaved.
and then they can go in as well as all of those juices.
that 's when the flavor is so they can all go in there, make the most of your messages.
people if the way forward brought a learn from this that 's most of the flavor in there now so bring it up to a ball.
but it is on it to steam those muscles open.
and after about two or three minutes, we can move on to the next stage.
now we can drain off our eggs and then chill them down to put them into cold water.
next , and they stay in cold water for as long as they were in the hot water from right correct.
i 'm learning and we can cook up ruins.
the prawns had been marinated not for very long.
we could have done them overnight would be better.
this is fine.
just being lazy and then those problems can go under a very hot grill.
it wo n't need long just two or three minutes, oh, well, it 's a bubbling feast into which we can put our final things are rice noodles, which to go, i 'll bean sprouts as well, last minute cooking.
you want to keep that crunch.
i love being person sellers broad.
and you want to keep that crunch.
the last few of our macadamia nuts.
if you could just roughly chop those, i ate a few of them and our fresh coriander.
if you can just slice that up, finish off balance at all those flavors.
fresh juice, align pretty much good to go both easy and at the same time, we 're going to bring those on top in just a moment, OK, and then just before we start peeling.
we can get some of this plated up leaving plenty of room in the middle for prawns.
now on our website we 've got loads of currys from all around the world.
so go check them out it 's sorted food dot com eggs.
now hard boiled or do crack the motherboard and just peel them of our eggs take apart into quarters grab crowds out some of our amazing prunes on top and they are in fact, i went straight up you wo n't get it wait i 'm using the pace just curved all those fresh flavors, and wow i ca n't imagine how much better they would be if you had marinated them overnight and they get better, better.
but they 're pretty good as they are wow and then view to full eggs on top anyway this served.
but i think the colour is amazing saver that perfect look about, not too running not too hard and the final springfield.
coriander , macadamia nuts chopped up and that is a seafood.
laksa sorted it 's pretty awful.
first , some prawns and some of the soup to nuts gives that kind of grainy richness so much flavoring back.
that is amazing.
and the egg kind of unusual about traditional malaysia, and it works really well.
thank you, malaysia.
i love it.
