hi , everyone into a meeting recipes dot com.
so i 'm going to show how to make a really delicious and quick vegan pets time.
it 's one of my favorite dishes, and i actually had this for breakfast.
i was kind of fine.
but i felt like big breakfast and medical breakfasts and post in my instagram account, and.
so many people ask me for the recipe side.
but i 'll share with you and what 's special about this particular pad time.
is that i 'm using sambhab pattern instead of the usual tamarind paste?
we 're faced what is traditionally used, but bob, bob will have some extra nutrition query and run.
so that 's why i 'm going to use that anna most going to be using some sure talking noodles which actually have zero calories, ends, or cops.
and i love this dish.
someone to take around fifteen to twenty minutes to make and the show talking noodles are super quick to prepare.
so it 's much easier and faster than using regular rice noodles.
so , yeah, i ca n't wait to show how to make this, let 's go to my kitchen by for this pad.
thai , you 'll need one garlic clove, minced hundred grams of sure talking noodles.
they 'll come in a pack of four hundred grams.
i 've got the thick ones here.
but i actually prefer the thin ones from this dish and i rinse them quickly under some hot running water under a tab to get rid of the fishy smell, you can also use regular rice noodles if you like if you cook with them, using some vegetable oil for the source of mixed together.
one tablespoon of al bab powder.
one tablespoon of gluten free tamari and two tablespoons of agallah bay.
if you ca n't get these ingredients, that 's the case, well, you can just use regular tamarind paste, and maple syrup.
but if you use regular soy source then it wo n't be gluten-free anymore.
all selects use one quarter cup of textured vegetable protein in the shape of mints and asserted in half a cup of hot water for like two minutes, just to soften it.
and then i squeezed it through a strain on to get rid of all of the water.
you do n't have to use this if you do n't want to, but i think it tastes really good in this pad time for the vegetables.
i 'm using one small zucchini, sliced one small carrot sticks, and half a cup of bean sprouts.
if you ca n't get ahold of the bin spots.
that 's OK, can just leave them out if you want to you can also use other vegetables in this dish, but i like this combination.
this dish does n't really need extra cell.
but if you want you can add some in.
i 'm going to be adding in some pepper some spring onions for garnish that 's around two tablespoons though.
and some chopped up roasted peanuts if you like it had tyler bit spicy, you can also garnish with some chili flakes, which is what i 'm going to do.
i will stay out of chili sauce with flank before you start cooking have everything prepped and ready to go.
because by cooking at high heat in a big club pan or walk at in your oil and the new garlic mints fire quickly until it 's fragrant and make sure you 're working faster.
yeah , otherwise it garlic will start to burn and then add in your chopped up zucchini and carrots.
keep your story on high.
the whole time while we 're making this dish and we want to certify the cikini and carry it until it 's just slightly cooked.
this should take a few minutes then add in around one tablespoon of your chopped spring onions and fathered with the vegetables as well, next, we want to add an L sure talking noodles or if you 're using rice noodles and you can also add them here as well by everything together for a few minutes and then add in your souls and this makes everything.
so that everything is going to get coated with the source, and we want the source to cam aliza, magisa bid.
so that all of the ingredients in the pan are going to get all of the flavors from the source.
once it 's produced a bit, adding your textured vegetable protein and then just mix that end with all of the other ingredients as well, we also want to file that for a minute or two to let it absorb the source.
next add and bean sprouts and then just fire everything together.
and we also want to season everything with some freshly cracked black pepper.
now we want to just still everything around for another few minutes until the source has disappeared.
so that everything should be really tasty with all of the flavor from the source.
when the sources disappeared you can play it up and this recipe makes enough for two people or one very hungry person.
you finish it up.
i 'm going to sprinkle on some chopped up roasted peanuts as well as some spring onions, which, is the leftovers from before, and some chili flakes for the like mine.
pad thai little bit spicy.
this pad thai is so tasty and quick to make, and it 's also perfect to take to work as lunch.
