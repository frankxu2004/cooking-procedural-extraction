samosa , this treats i 'll somoza is very popular becaus.
surprisingly , they make the same users in the morning and till evening, they remain fresh.
what is that they do their little bit of citric acid in making these samosas specially?
the street side some models and simple with little bit of south indian touch.
in this, so for this first, i 'm going to make the masallah by adding little bit of oil in a hot pan.
and we 're going to temper it even with mustard seeds.
hot oil and mustard seeds wait till the mustard seeds splatter now look at this.
the mustard seeds platter that 's when the real flavor comes out add cumin seeds produce a flavor, reduce aflame.
add green chili curry leaf and turmeric just makes this add little bit of salt.
an citric acid two OK.
now as soon as you add citric acid, just at little bit of water hahahaha, autumns it just makes the citric acid in the water and add, add chopped coriander and also a little bit of mint.
now , you know, the secret of this street side suppose us very, very testing in this figure dad.
the potato mashed just cause this OK.
now this masala is already be going to always remember, there 's the masallah when it is done.
because if this is tasty, you know, some of us are going to be tasted very nice the sadness from the citric acid kept switch off the flame.
i 'm going to let this cool down.
then i 'm going to show you how to stuff less masella into wonderful summer sheets.
now that the potato marcela is ready, i 'm going to show you how to make the dough and how to roll the sheets to make our summer sauce.
now i 'm going to make this by taking around three hundred grams of flour in this for the flavoring.
i 'm going to add are joining the dope and in this ad amount of salt in the sheet now, make a val and poor around hundred grams of vegetable shortening oil or ghee.
whatever you want to make.
now add water and make it a stiff dough that is like prado art like chapati, chapati is varisoft, the poor is a tighter door.
so we 're going to add water, and we 're going to make the door, and another thing is once you make the dope.
we 're going to rest the door that 's well, you are some users will come out even better now.
the door is ready.
all you do is just take a clean rap or a cloth and just drop it and after resting it for thirty minutes, we 're going to make the summers.
once you rest the dope.
divide them into the portions.
you want if you want bigger suppose as you may have to take bigger portions if you want small supposes take it.
because each door you will be able to make two summers.
us now roll it first.
little bit rounds for rolling the pooris or samosa dough, you never have to use flour becaus.
if you use flat first thing oil spoils, and you know, if you use the right amount of shortening in the door then you will be able to roll the sheet easily.
look at this, first make it slightly round and then.
now make it elongated like egg ship.
make it slightly thinner look at this, once you roll it and you 'll be able to see kind of literally.
the bottom little bit that 's when you cut like this.
and you have the door ready for two summers, has got it and one more thing is once you roll it keep one over another?
and he would not have a problem.
because they wo n't stick and you can keep like this clean rap in the fridge for a day or two and still roll the summer, says if you add the right shortening, and the door is correct, they will never stick.
now the summer.
so sheets are ready.
all you need to do is just wet the edges and make them into cones as simple as this and stuff this potato masala in here.
just make sure stuff them.
good and then bring these edges and press it hard OK.
then the same thing this side, and this triangle bring it in here and the fold and press this really nice look at this.
once you press this, this will get nicely sealed.
so when you fry nothing is going to come out.
now put it on the table and give them a nice ship that 's it your summer sauce are ready now.
you 're going to fly the summers in oil.
the oil should not be too hot.
but it should not be too cool, either once you add the starts, bubbles should start coming in an fright till it is nice and golden , now.
after frame look at these summers as how evenly colored, they are, you know, that 's well, you are summer sales will come out perfect a good samosa is good only when you have the summer sublight.
