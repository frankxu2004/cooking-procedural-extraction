hey , everybody this is dave from cooking sherron today.
so let 's get started wow what i have here is about a pound of lean ground beef.
so to make the patties.
i 'm going to add about half a cup of bread crumbs to it.
a small chopped onion now you want this chopper really, really fine an egg.
a tablespoon of worcester, sir sauce about half a teaspoon of salt.
another half teaspoon of ground, black pepper, a couple of cloves of crushed garlic, four five drops of tabasco sauce.
now you could leave this out, but i find it just gives it a little extra kick.
and i 'm just going to take my spatula.
he ran begin, mixing this together, then i 'm going to switch to my hands just to make sure everything is really well combined.
bye now that i 've got everything, nicely combined.
i 'm going to scoop up a small handful and former patty that 's about.
oh , i 'd say three inches in diameter.
this really depends on the size of your buns.
so you kind of have to eyeball your buns.
we 're making your patties, anne will set these aside on a plate and repeat the process for the rest of the mixture.
actually , i should mention that these really freeze nicely, so what you could do.
is you could make a bunch up, put them in the freezer and use them another day?
but OK, i 've got my charcoal grill.
nice and hot here of course, you can use an electric grill or gas grill or even a frying pan.
so i 'm just going to slip my slider, patties on in my case, i 'm gonna cook them for about seven or eight minutes on each side.
it really depends on your grill.
so just keep an eye on them and make sure they 're cooked through, well, the burgers are grilling do n't forget to click that subscribe button and never miss a video.

the burger patties are nicely done and cooked through i 'm going to remove them from the grill and slip them onto a toasted dinner roll.
now this is the way i build my slider.
of course it 's entirely up to you how you build yours.
but i 'm going to start by grading some cheddar cheese over top of the patty followed by a slice of tomato onion.
some lettuce, one of my all time favorites yellow mustard to catch up and last, but not least relish.
now i 'm simply going to slip the top on put, a toothpick in the center just to hold it together.
and you 're ready to dig in and there.
