hello , and welcome to a thousand simple recipes, to die, i 'm in the kitchen, making one of my favorite mexican snacks.
the barrido, and in this video, i will do a being version that you can be really created with this and you.
some roasted or barbecued meats.
rice salads roasted peppers and onions and with a guacamole in a tamara cell, so this is a really flavors and snack.
so without further ado, let 's make a mexican burrito.
he 's out ingredients for abba, raytown.
i 've got some guacamole here, which i 've done in another greedy.
i should check the link and also have done a tortilla or flat bray.
also , check, check that out in another link, but you can buy those things in the supermarket if you do n't have the time.
i 've got some tomato paste.
some grated cheddar cheese.
some refried beans, i 've got some cocoa powder cumin powder.
some dried oregano some fresh mint lime juice.
i 've got some red onion and some garlic.
i 've got some chopped tomato some coriander and some fresh chili 's, and as always, the recipe and the ingredient list is in the description box below.
so the first thing i 'm going to do is make a tomato salsa.
and i 'm just going to do seated, and basically all you do is just chop your tomato into quarters or eighths and just take the seeds out of them like that, and then shot them.
finally , now, without onion.
i 've got a whole only there are just chopped, and i 'm just going to add those to the celsa, and i 'm out, got some four or five mint leaves in our think mint, goes, really well, with this tomato salsa and.
so i 'm just going to slice that up and will just roughly slice that up it does n't have to be too small and i 'll just add that to the, the salsa and all that my bed half a bunch of coriander a pinch of dried oregano half a teaspoon of salt and on just got a yellow habanero chili this is optional course if you like it hot, i 'm just going to slice that up finally and put that in as well of course, i 've got one line that are just juiced and we 're just going to pull that through, and will mix that up and what she can do is put this into a fridge for an hour while you refried beans and the longer it sits there the more those flavors will really come, together really, nicely and it 'll be a absolutely delicious tomorrow celsa.
so i 'm just going to cover that i 'll put some of that yellow chili in and that 's it for it to matter, seltzer and onto our refried beans.
so doing our refried beans, just got about two or three tablespoons of olive oil in there and i 'm just going to throw in one, dried red chili.
now this is optional of course, i 'm just going to let that fly up and i 'm going to throw in about quarter of a teaspoon of dried organic some garlic about clove and a half to two clothes with garlic, just going to fry all those up, and then we will throw in our half are red onions that i 've shot finally with the onions i just want a little bit of color into the onions i do n't want to cook them too much that i just want them to get a little bit of color that 's just starting the color now, and that 's been on for about two, two and a half minutes and.
now i 'm just going to add my code that half teaspoon each of cocoa and cumin, powder, and that 's going to give it a nice the beans, the refried beans are really nice, reach taste, and we 're just going to fry those up for a few seconds yeah, i 'm just going to throw in a tablespoon of tomato paste.
now i 'm just going to fry, put that to one side and fry that to get the tartness out of the tomatoes and that, that some maybe probably fifteen seconds or fry that up for and then add it to the rest of the mixer through the onions in the spices.
so basically what we 're trying to do is just build layers into the refried beans.
so that 's a bad enough and i 'm just going to mix those all through now, and when we decided the tomatoes for us tomato salsa i, we just going to use all those DC did tomatoes, and we 're going to add that we just cook that up for a few minutes and i 'm just going to add about one teaspoon of sugar just two balance out that acidity in the tomatoes and we 'll just fry that happens for a few minutes and then we 'll add our refried beans.
so this has been on for about three or four minutes and i 'm.
now going to add my refried beans, and i 've got probably one can the other thing i 'm going to add is, just about a quarter of a teaspoon of salt to the mix and will just cook those up for a few minutes and i 'm just going to mesh probably half of them like this and the rest will leave right i, i hope and this is going on for about ten minutes, and i 'm just going to turn the heat off that, and will wrap up our burrito.
now i 've got my fresh tortilla that i 've just made.
but if you 're using one from a supermarket or a shot just give it up quick blast of heat either in the microwave or fifteen seconds on a hot pan on either side just to loosen up.
so it 's easy to run.
now the first thing i 'm going to do is put some then across margarita, becaus i 'm also once we roll their burrito, i 'm going to put it on a fry pan and quickly, fry it.
so this cheese will melt once it hits the heat and.
so you want to close to the bread and i 'll just put that into the fry pan.
so and that will also help the flatbread whole together when you 're reading it.
so now i 've just brown this on each side for fifteen or twenty seconds and now, it 's ready to eat so, here we have our mexican burrito and i ca n't wait to take a bite out of this and arcadia with salsa the melted cheese in the refried beans, that is, a great combat.
so that 's all i have for you this week.
so you 'll have to come back and see me.
next week on a thousand simple recipes bye.
