so today we 're making meatloaf.
this is a recipe that i made quite often and just like any kind of meat loaf it can be really individualized to your own specific taste, you can put whatever you want in it.
but this is what i generally put in mind as a seller.
i put one half cup of dry bread crumbs one half cup of quick cooking oats.
although you could use large flake oats as well to this, i add one teaspoon of salt about a teaspoon of pepper.
but a half a cup of milk, two beaten eggs, and some garlic powder, i guess that 's about a teaspoon, and i put some minced dried onion.
because maximum like the fresh onions too much in there.
so it does n't seem to mind the dried onions and a few shakes of worcester sauce.
and they 're going to blend this together now really.
the only, really good way to blend meatloaf is with your hands.
so that 's we 're going to do.
next OK there 's two schools of thought as far as meatloaf go some of them say you should just hardly mix that at all makes it, and just barely, and leave them.
i like to mix the meat very, very well, mixing ingredients in very well, and work.
the meatloaf, until it gets very smooth.
it changes the consistency of the meat.
you 'll get more of a compact lofi kind of texture to the meat after its cooked if you work it quite a bit i like that you may not.
so you, do what you want and take a large baking pan and you 're going to form it into a loaf shape.
now what i do is on the top, the top i kind of flatten out a little bit.
and i make it kind of into very shallow canoe shape, if you can imagine so that there 's like an indentation on the top.
now this is just so that when you pour the sauce over top that hold it in now this is.
my sauce that i make i do n't usually measure how you kind of cord into the bowl.
but i measured it just to see how roughly what the quantities were, that 's about a couple ketchup.
i had about two heaping tablespoons of brown sugar.
ann about tablespoon and a half or so of prepared yellow mustard and about a tablespoon of worcester sauce and stir this together.
and this is going to go over top of the meatloaf, and you 'll see that the sauce was the social stay on the top of the meatloaf.
because you created a little spot for there.
it is just some of the oven you want to make it for about an hour until a meat thermometer pushed into the center is at least one hundred sixty degrees.
fahrenheit , that way, you know, that it 's safety.
then you just let it rest for about fifteen minutes.
and then you screw slice it up.
