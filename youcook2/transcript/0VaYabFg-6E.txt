hi , and welcome to the video on how to make some curried mussels big, great dishes that in a spicy, i 'm going to show you how we make those right away for those you will need around a part of my soul 's some, a little bit of onion, a quarter of a chop red paper, some siri, ribbit of gallic and some carrot, i 'm going to take hold out here i 'm going to process it to a food processor to do some kind of little sofrito.
i 'm also going to use some curry powder cilantro little white wine, and any cream like two tablespoon of white wine here and three tablespoon of heavy cream.
so first thing.
first , i 'm going to process that through my robot group to just drop everything.
so i just drop make my rest of ritter here with my carrot onion celery.
garlic , red pepper.
i do n't want to pay start.
one thing i want to mention, too, i forgot to talk about that muscles.
it 's very important but your muscles are very fresh.
if you see any open masters here, like this one, it 's open.
that muscle might be dead.
and you do n't want to use it.
so if it closed back it 's a life this one is just closing back right on you here.
see what happened in muscle.
get cold, and i said get cold.
they open up in my finger here.
we kind of warm up a little bit and clothes see what my soldiers clothes back.
i have another one.
let 's see the same thing happen.
said i put in my hand like that.
see it 's closing back which is a real cold also all those muscles are clean.
but there is one thing here, see that dinner string that 's for beard of the muscle, you want to remove that we remove it, you just put it off like that now.
no one thing after you remove that bird that beer the muscle will die and you want to make sure you could them right after huh.
so i checked the other one before and i know that they are clean and alive.
i drink the feeder beard right here.
now that you know, about that we 're going to prevent also sometime if they open what you can do is try to find another one that 's open that one is open right here you see, it 's open i 'm going to take it i 'm going to bang it a little bit like that and see it 's closing back that 's another way to see very close back to OK.
so have i said, they plan here i 'm going to first thing, i 'm going to do is i 'm going to thirty myself.
rito in a bit of oil, i just realized i have too much here.
i 'm just going to use half of that.
i poured it out here half tablespoon is enough.
i 'm gonna really warm up.
and then i 'm going to add my mixed vegetable here.
the cilantro right here.
i 'm going to chop it costly an added at the end to the muscles, OK.
here we go i do n't want to plan too hard.
because i do n't want to really give any color to those vegetables when making muscles, i will season it at the end.
muscle zarcilla salty on their own, and before i put.
so that i want to check the seasoning when i 'm done, and then i see if it needs some salt on it.
OK , adopt one here.
i 'm going to add some of my curie, i made that on curie here.
it 's a mix of spices, depending how spicy you want it, you know, you just put it in as much.
you think you, you like, yeah, like it pretty spicy, cook it in a bit.
not too long now, i 'm going to add my white wine.
and then my muscles OK.
now very bit of the cream huh.
give me the nearest air.
i 'm going to cover it with a leaf.
we going to steam those muscles can see the reflection of the coming out here great.
now so as i could, then, i 'm going to shake them a little bit lined up that help for them to open up while it 's cooking i 'm going on this side here to chop my cilantro, cilantro is one of those earth.
it 's OK to use the stamps from them, because there 's a lot of clever in them and they 're very thunder shit.
oh , they start to open up, sit up at one is done.
already so in a way for all of them to be forty, fully open let 's check.
now OK, look at that real, nicely open OK.
so now i 'm going to rule them into my born here.
and then i will rate is the source a little bit more OK, so we are removing bank completely open those are, nice.
