the arts shopping, gorgeous parks championship soccer.
and yes, i have to say it.
now you may not think of fish and chips is great food.
but i 'm going to take you to one of the very best fish and chip shops in the city.
it 's easily accessible from any nearby underground station by the way, the tube, which is what they call it is the easiest way to get from anywhere to london 's victoria station, which is right down the street from where we 're going for dinner and that would be see fresh london big ben buckingham palace.
westminster abbey, the tower of london and the queen, what 's for dinner tonight will come on hitting me.
it 's fish and chips, of course, what else back in home fish and chips is always been one of my favourites.
so just before i flew across the path.
i did my homework.
discovered that see fresh restaurant right across the street here in central london has, some of the best fishing ships in all of england is absolutely no way, i was going to miss out on this golden tender and crispy opportunity to taste one of this country 's most famous dishes there 's something fishy going over there and i 'm going to check it out open places, brooklyn, simple just fish and chips pretty much what you 're getting a lot of good company the menu has different kinds of fish.
you can have fried or grilled and i asked which of the fish, they 'd recommend for my fish and chips, and they said card overhead is definitely the way to go big white flakes, unlike haddock, which are a little bit smaller.
and it 's so sweet and tender and crispy on the outside, which is exactly how efficient ship, ship, everybody here has been terrific.
had a great time here from all the noise in the background everyone else is having a great time too?
hey , you 're in luck, you do n't have to come all the way to london.
make great fishing ships at home, got some great recipes for you, first, stop back the seafood department in ninos, ATM.
i 'm doing some fish and chips, tonight.
what do you got, you got some card also?
create those are pretty good size.
what size for laser.
those alright give me two of 'em.
you 're going my friend alright.
do n't be late six o'clock english fish and chips?
they 're not only a classic dish there practically synonymous with england itself to the english, there is iconic as well big ben, and just the sacredness westminster abbey, which means they better be authentic and that means batter, dip not breaded fried not baked fresh not frozen definitely big filets not sticks or nuggets and that 's for the chips.
well , they 're not the kind of potato chip.
we normally associate with that word rather there, fresh those and those would be idaho potatoes, which are generally cut into fat sticks there.
i called them french fries and then double fried but more about that, later.
what that said how about we give it a toss.
let 's head over to the kitchen where i 've got everything we need ready to go both of my recipes are beyond simple.
so you might be tempted to add additional ingredients to make it better.
do n't it really wo n't improve these recipes?
extra ingredients will just make them different.
so what fish do i use the most common fish used for fish and chips are card like this piece right here.
but i prefer card and apparently.
so did my english friends specifically fresh cod filets about four to five inches long and about a half an inch to one inch thick the batter itself is very easy.
just place one cup of all purpose flour in a medium size, mixing bowl with a half teaspoon of pepper.
one teaspoon of salt and then whisk in an equal quantity of beer, which would be about a cup.
the final consistency of a thin pancake batter pretty easy huh.
hey , let 's talk better for a second.
first of all for all of you on a gluten free diet you 're in luck.
because rice flour anna gluten free beer will actually work and by the way, regular budweiser, or bud light are said not to be gluten, free.
but there are others that are speaking a beer.
i prefer nail like this one.
it does n't have to be english, but what the heck it ca n't hurt.
a pilsner beer will also work, well, but i 'd stay away from stouts.
i find them the little too bitter, and it ruins the delicate flavor of the fish where you choose though i recommend you allow the finish better to rest about an hour, before using it.
this will reduce some of the fizziness, which gives you a better crust.
in the end.
next to egg or not to egg, well, you may find that some batter recipes call for an egg mine does n't.
it 's not necessary, granted, an egg could help the better to stick to the fish a little bit better.
but the downside is that it can also make the cross more doughy and less crisp OK, my batteries rested for about an hour.
let 's go fry.
some fish you 're going to find it 's a whole lot easier than you think.
OK , i know i 'm lucky to have a deep fat fryer.
but you do n't need one in your home just simply take a medium size saucepan in about a quart of canola oil or vegetable oil, and he did to about three hundred and fifty degrees and that will work just the same as my deep fat fryer will.
so to start your fish.
i 've actually taken some more flour with salt and pepper and i placed it in a shallow bowl.
and we 're going to do is you 're going to take your fish filet that i 've cut.
going to place it in the flower, and you 're going to read it or flower it OK after you 've done that you 're going to simply just grab the corner, shake off any excess flour and place it in your batter.
you want to make sure that it gets coded really well on both sides in this better like i said, before is about the thickness of a thin pancake batter.
we 're going to let it all drip off.
that 's important because if you leave all that excess batter on and let it into the oil.
what 's going to happen is all that, better is going to kind of blow off the side of the filet, and that 's.
so we 've shaken this a little bit just very carefully.
lower it into the fat.
i 'm not letting it touch the bottom quite yet until it starts to firm up.
then i 'm going to kind of lay it down just like that.
so already you 're going to see that after a moment, or they 're going to start to float a little bit and that 's.
because the battery starts to expand a little bit and create some air inside of it, and that 's good.
because it 's going to make the final fill.
a nice and crispy, that 's it we 're going to cook for about six to eight minutes we 're going to turn over once in the process.
OK , it 's been about eight minutes or so, i turned these over once on each side.
so they 've been frying in each side about, uh, four five minutes.
and they look great.
they look nice and crispy.
what you want to do now is to just lift them out carefully.
golden brown, those are just tap it slightly on a little bit of absorbent paper towel, and that would be one portion of fish right there are going to make our chips.
now chips are n't french fries.
are more like fat irregular shape, which is like their chipped from a potato that 's how they get their name?
and we 're going to start with a russet potato, which you would know as an idaho, an whether you use a potato peeler or use a knife and i 'm sometimes more comfortable using a paring knife and i am a potato peeler you 're going to trim off all of his skin you can leave little on, if you like.
but definitely take the eyes out of the potato those are not something you want to have left in there.
so we get our potato trim just like this, and typically you 're going to want to cut them about all three eights of an inch.
thick , i take the extra corner off here.
an i will then cut him just like this.
we 're getting something like that now.
what i want you to do is you 're going to take some water.
some cold water maybe the little salt in it and you 're going to place your chips in the water, and you 're going to let them rinse for awhile, and then after that we 're going to take them out play some on to a couple layers of paper towel, and we 're going to have them drive and let him sit after that for a few minutes to make sure they 're really, really dry.
that 's very, very important.
that , we 're going to double fry them.
i 'm going to show you that in a minute, OK, my chips are nice and drive and patting him down for a couple of minutes.
i 'm going to lift them off carefully into my basket, or you can put him into a skimmer and lower meant.
if you have a quart size pan with some oil in it and i have set this at two hundred, and ninety degrees.
now is much lower than you.
normally fry french fries.
but these are not going to be actually cooking to turn brown they 're going to be cooking to just take the.
flesh , and make sure it 's nice and tender.
so we 're going to drop it into the oil.
you see, it 's not making all this great noise and lots of bubbles and steam coming up.
because the temperature there is much lower than it normally is going to let those cook for about three or four minutes.
nice and tender on the inside.
and then we 're going to pull him out and let him rest again after they rested a few moments were going to turn the temperature of the fat up to three hundred and fifty degrees.
just like we did the fish, and we 're going to fly him until the golden brown, and we 've got chips.
OK , it 's been about four five minutes and my chips have been frying at two hundred ninety degrees.
i want to show you this.
look at how light they are.
they 're not dark at all, and that 's good.
that 's because they were rinsed really well.
and they are tender and cooked on the inside.
but they have n't brown on the outside.
so what i 'm going to do.
now and you could do this hours ahead of time if you wanted to even put him in the refrigerator if you like is, we 're going to let these sit.
you may have seen when you go to the restaurants.
that before their french fries are fried, they look like this, and that 's why they 're nice and fluffy inside tastes like potato and there brown on the outside their blanched first and that 's what we 've just done.
so i 'm going to let these rest for a minute, while i turn the temperature in my fire up to three hundred and fifty degrees.
and they 're going to turn these back and frame up for the golden brown in our fish, and chips are done.
think about four or five minutes.
there nice and golden brown.
so we 're going to shake off the excess oil.
i want any of that play.
some on some absorbent paper towels getting a little salt i use sea salt and then adam to our plate, us like that little bit of tartar sauce and there you have it traditional english fish and chips does n't get any better than that.
so easy their traditional.
