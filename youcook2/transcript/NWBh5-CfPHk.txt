now what we 're going to start off with is homeless.
an fava beans, now humbles are homeless peas are garbanzo beans.
you want two cups of garbanzo beans, an a cup and a half of fava beans, when you start up when you buy them.
they 're really small.
and they 're going to be dried.
you 're going to want to soak them overnight before you do this.
so if you know, you 're going to be making falafel the.
next day so your beans the night before when you soak them they 're going to double in size just like that.
yeah , one that 's this big, and one that 's this big.
see the difference same thing with the father beans the double in size.
could they absorb all of the water?
what we 're going to do.
we 're going to start up by blending knees in a food processor until they 're very crumbly now.
you do n't want to do it out of the can only.
because the garbanzo beans or chickpeas that are out of the can have a lot of preservatives in them and they 're a little bit too wet for the falafel that make sure it becomes too moisan it will fall apart on you when you 're trying to fry it no use, a spoon to being on the side to make sure that they all get one day.
the same way you want to get a large bowl.
and you want to empty them into the large cool, let me show.
you look how crumbly the mixture is there not a paste.
they 're just very crumbly now, while you 're doing all of this, you wanna heat about an inch of oil in a pan vegetable oil corn oil as long as a vegetable oil.
that 's fine put on low heat, and that the oil warm up boy preparedness and i said we 're going to do is, we 're going to blend the father beans, make sure you buy the peels, fava beans.
i know that sometimes they sell them.
unpeeled , you want them peeled.
but i 'm in the blender.
london the same way, you did at barbanza dead, the product.
and they are the same texture as the homeless or.
as , well, we call it harmless in arabic, but they 're called chickpeas or garbanzo beans.
these are fava beans.
because a lot of beans in middle eastern and mediterranean cooking as i 'm sure you 've notice.
now you have them in a nice bowl just mix it up with a spoon.
next we 're going to blend the other ingredients in the blender and then add it.
OK , we are halfway there next thing.
you 're going to need also you 're going to blend it in the food processor is one big yellow onion.
i just chopped it up coarsely just that it fits in the process.
are you going to also need one whole bunch of cilantro or about two cops, make sure you wash them, rent them out really, well, you do n't have to chop them up or anything 'cause we 're going to put in a food processor cup or a half a bunch of parsley flat, leaf italian processes the fest?
has a lot of flavor?
the main ingredient, the best ingredient in the world, garlic.
eight nice large cloves of garlic minced if you already have your garlic minced, you want two large tablespoons of garlic garlics amazing as great aroma.
agree element to the dish.
it 's great, so, let 's put all these in the food processor.
and then we 're going to blend them up.
make sure they all fit in here.
garlic and just blend it up until it 's well combined OK now that, that 's done.
