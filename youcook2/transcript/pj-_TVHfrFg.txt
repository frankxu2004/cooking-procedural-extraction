hi is john here.
and today i 'm going to show you a simple method of cutting tuna sushi me from a trend line.
firstly , we 're going to locate the top of the line.
it is a very thick and tough part sticking out making it easy to find we do this.
because it 's easier to trim them into blocks suitable for sushi me cut this part off as level as possible, using a back and forth motion of the knife facing our forty five clockwise.
degree angle set this piece of side.
now find the side of the line that appears more lean, lean meat tends to be purified bears in between to lookout for the darker red side.
this off cut can be used for tuna tartar, negatory or any kind of raw tuna dish.
next cut about two to three centimeters away from the side depending on how high you want your sushi.
me , and trim blocks as straight as possible, inserting the blade into flesh and firmly touching the chopping board this ensures a one time, clean cut trim is many other blocks, using the same technique.
now that we have our socimi block trim the sides, down making it more straight to a more even the width of the block can be about three to four centimeters.
but this is purely up to personal preference straightening the block with your hands, helps, you achieve them or even block.
if you need to trim the top if it is too uneven.
now R block his ready to cut into sushi me got an indent, about ten degrees and follow this line insert the knife slightly facing upwards and make a downward pulling slice motion for.
either meet you choose how thick you want your slices here.
i am demonstrating some quite thinner slices, but as i go into the meats i get slightly thicker and thicker.
now take a portion of your sushimi spread it out.
and it 's ready to present.
