hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with drunken mussels.
i like my shellfish like i like my sellers, and this is one of the easiest shellfish recipes ever and once you have your ingredients together this thing takes about ten minutes start to finish.
so here 's how you do it the first and most important ingredient, of course is the muscles.
these are from prince, edward island.
you 'll see him in a seafood case.
it 'll say P E.
I , they should be incredibly fresh.
they need to be scrubbed really well, and rinsed off.
and if you see any of those little beards attached mine really did n't have any.
i were pretty clean and as far as portioning.
i usually go with like about a pound of mussels per person, so our muscles are set on to the rest of the ingredients.
so i 'm going to need you to mess up some garlic.
you can use regular garlic, but, you know, what i found some green garlic in the market and i decided to use that.
so just, like using green onions, i 'm pretty much going to use the white and light parts, and i 'm going to sit up.
nice and fine and again do n't feel bad if you do n't find green garlic, regular garlic works extraordinarily well, and is incredibly delicious.
so , do n't even worry about it, recipes it 's super easy, but you need to get all your ingredients prepped ahead of time, which is called.
of course means imposs.
OK , so are garlics ready.
we 're going to set that aside, next.
we 're going to do some italian parsley.
and , you know, my method for this you hold the stems.
you hold your knife.
sharp knife, at a forty five degree angle, and you just shave off all the leaves so easy, do not pick parsley leaves off the stems takes too long?
and once we 've done that we just give it a chop, not too fine, something like that and other than a little bit of lemon zest or flakes.
that 's about it, alright, so we 're going to head over to the stove where you need a stock pot like this with a tight fitting lid, right.
very , very important so make sure you have that before you, even think of starting this recipe.
we 're going to throw in a chunk of butter.
i 'm going to put that on medium heat and once it melts, we 're going to add our garlic.
we 're going to give that about a thirty second sizzle after which i 'm going to add my red pepper flakes.
i like this a little bit spicy, but, you know, i like most things a little bit spicy.
so i 'm going to add a big pinch of those give that about fifteen seconds in the butter add my lemons, asked i use disaster to get those nice thin strands.
you could also grade it on the microplane, usinas do both many times.
so the lemon says, goes in you give that about thirty seconds and then quickly pouring your wine.
the wine stops the cooking, we do not want to burn or brown the garlic.
so that whole process of sauteing the garlic pepper and lemon zest only took about a minute.
once the winds in i gave it a few turns of freshly ground black pepper.
you generally do n't need salt.
the muscles have enough natural salt.
so be careful when seasoning point, our drunken mussel broth is ready, we 're going to place on the lid.
we 're going to turn the heat to high, and we 're going to bring this to a boil as soon as it boils you 're going to quickly throw in your muscles.
do n't throw any of the ice in if you had him sitting in water or something like that you want to drain it?
you just want the muscles are going to quickly place the lid back on.
and by the way, i 'm so glad i wore a shirt for this video.
generally , i cook topless.
so the lids on we 're going to give the pod the old shakka, shakka and let it sit there undisturbed for exactly after one minute, remove the lid.
it take a spoon and give it a quick stir.
just like that couple turns place, the lid back on and wait two minutes after which you should be getting closer going to see lots of the shells opening in fact back.
you can actually see it opening so cool at that point.
we 're going to dump in our italian parsley.
give it another stir, put the lid back on, and as soon as those shells are open you 're done it might take another minute.
it might take another two minutes.
it could take possibly one and a half minutes or three minutes who knows go by site when it looks like they 're all open your done alright.
the shell should be opened like that.
the muscle should still be huge in plumping gorgeous and not shriveled empathetic right.
the only way to screw this recipe up is to keep boiling these after they open and of course, if there 's a couple that do n't open that 's not.
just throw those away and deal with the good ones to serve.
you 're going to want to transfer those into a big wide bowl of course.
you 're going to ladle over copious amounts of that amazing drunken bath.
i highly suggest you serve it with some lemon and some grilled bread of course, if you 're having grilled problems, i feel bad for you son.
but you could just use the toaster instead, and that 's it.
drunken mussels, how fast and easy was that and of course, drunken mussels is just a generic term for mussels steamed in any kind of alcoholic beverage.
i 've done this with beer with things like sherry, of course, you do n't have to use alcohol.
you can do some clam juice or just some water is it is good, of course, not, not even close again here.
i 'm gonna take my freakishly small metal fork and dip that muscle in that amazing broth.
garlicky spicy lemony just unbelievable, and while dipping the muscle in that broth is pretty awesome.
nothing compares to how awesome, dipping the bread.
in there is it 's just spectacular, and if you 're feeling extra sexy, i like to place it on the bread, and drizzle some of that buttery, garlicky wine broth over it 's just a very special experience that i hope you experience especially.
so head over to food wishes.
for all the ingredient amounts, well, as usual, and as always enjoy.
