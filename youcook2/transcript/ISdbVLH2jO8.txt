so , i remember this group on facebook and it 's for ninja owners.
and if you 're not a member, i 'll put a link to it, down below you need to go ahead and become a member that group.
it 's full of awesome people and there super helpful.
have great recipes?
an one AM today that we are going to try was submitted by a lady by the name of lori leonard anna hope.
i said your last name right.
but she posted a picture in this group of general sows chicken, and it looked amazing.
so i said i gotta, try it.
so i went to the grocery today got what we needed and we 're going to try some general chicken.
so what you will need is roughly two pounds of chicken breast chicken tenders are going to cut these in little squares i got the chicken breasts is a dollar cheaper pound, then the tenders.
but need two pounds of chicken need two packets of the general.
so chicken seasoning mix.
and you can find this in your grocery in the asian food.
i 'll also need some general souls.
stir fry sauce find that in the same aisle, and then you just need a little bit of flour and a little bit of oil and then if you want to look it over rice you 'll need some rice , too.
i also picked these up here might try to mix those in applesauce.
OK , so i have about a cup of flour in zip, lock, and i 've got my chick in.
and it 's cut in one inch pieces.
so i 'm gonna put the chicken in there in the bag and then shake, shake it to coat the chicken hey.
so next, i 'm going to put the stove top or the ninja on stovetop, high.
and i 'm going to add four tablespoons of oil inside the ninja and warm it up.
OK , so, once your oil is hot annual scoop out some chicken out of your bag and then put it into the ninja annual, cook it on all sides.
get you right back in the same document stuffing.
yeah , OK, so i have all my chicken in there if you have more than i would probably just do single layer.
if you have more, he may cook some and then scoop it out.
and then put more in, but we 're going to let it cook.
and i 'm going to make sure.
it 's cooked all the way through OK as it cooks, i just continue i 'll make sure chicken is cooked thoroughly.
so keep on clicking OK.
so after looking at this packet this is essentially making general.
so sauce an each one of these is for one pound of chicken.
so on the back, you have to make it with soy sauce, water sugar.
you have to mix this packet with.
we do n't have soy sauce.
so i 'm going to make this up minus the soy sauce 'cause it 's only three tablespoons and mix those two together and make our general sows sauce.
OK , so i have my season packet mixture here.
and i have my bottle of general, so here i 'm going to pour it all into the ninja and see the chickens night and cooked brown.
so we 're going to pour everything in here and bring it to a boil.
so there i added everything i 'm going to start it up a little bit.
but that come to a boil again.
it looks like it is definitely boiling and we will turn it down to low, and let it simmer till it starts to thicken it.
so i have my can of chop suey vegetables.
i 'm going to add those in now.
i have drained them.
i 'm going to mix them in here while it 's emery.
get it all mixed up and then more let it all simmer for a few more minutes.
OK so cook some rice just real.
quick , on the stove and here we go.
here 's our general, sows.
chicken , sticking up quite a bit as you can see there.
we go looks delicious.
so we had a little modification along the way did n't exactly make the general sows recipe, according to plan.
but the combination of the one packet and the bottle of sauce was plenty of sauce and the flavor was great.
i mean, it really had a good, strong general flavor to it, the only thing i would change is probably put some more vegetables in there.
it , it was kind of just chick in, and we added that little can of vegetable.
but i think maybe some fresh broccoli or something would be good, cooked in with it other than that.
it was turned out really good.
so give it a try.
let us know how you made it.
