hi guys, today, i 'm going to show you how to make vietnamese spring rolls, which are also called.
goi , goons, now my mom used to make these all the time from when i was a little kid, but i thought they would have salad stick.
they are super fresh and super simple to make you just have to make sure you have the right ingredients.
this is your spring roll shopping list.
rice paper drawing plates rice noodles cilantro mint cucumbers.
iceberg lettuce and shrimp you can find all of these ingredients at an asian market.
we 're going to start by making the rice paper a bit more pliable.
now when you get the rice paper, it 's super, super hard.
because it 's made from ground up rice formed into these little plates, and then set out to dry.
so what you do is, we 're going to soak them in water.
we 're just going to take you could take a bowl.
you can take a sauce pan just as long as you can submerge the entire paper in the water and then you put it on to a drying plate.
now we 're going to start layering beginning with the iceberg lettuce start in the middle of the rice paper and leave some room on the sides.
so you can rep and roll.
then we 're going to add some more greens to the top.
the cilantro mint and the cucumbers now we 're going to top it off with some rice noodles now.
here 's a tip for you guys.
when you 're done cooking the rice noodles.
they 've already come to a boil when you 're ready.
you want to make sure to run them, water, this eliminates them from sticking and then called the rice noodles off with some shrimp.
we 're going to add some child.
so you 're just going to lay the chives on the top, letting some of it hang out of the other side.
and now it 's time to wrapping rule pick it up from the back end just like wrapping a burrito.
you 're going to tuck it in azure rolling we 're only going to do one end because we have the child is coming out the other end.
we really want to see those chives so we 're tucking and rolling now.
take the other end and folded over and roll right off of the drying plate, an unto your status.
now you ca n't have vietnamese spring rolls without some asian dipping sauces.
so i brought along two of my favourites.
we have a peanut and then we have a sweet and sour sauce.
