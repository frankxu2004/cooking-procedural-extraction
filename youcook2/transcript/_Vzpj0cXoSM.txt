how you two friends in this video, i 'm going to show you all how to make clam chowder.
secret recipe that she 's had all her life.
so , thank you so much, gramma more for this recipe.
and if you 're interested in learning how to make gramma, moras clam chowder stay tuned i already melted half a cup of butter into a large pot.
i also dice one cup of onion as well as three fourth cup of green pepper, a half of a red pepper as well, and i also have a half cup of sellers all the contents in your large pots at a generous half teaspoon of time into your veggies, and just mix it up.
add half a teaspoon of bay leaf now that you add a couple of your seasonings.
you 're just going to want to stir your contents until the vegetables are tended two cups of raw diced onions.
this is actually my second cup.
i already put the first trip mix the contents in mix everything together, then add two bottles of an eight ounce of clam juice to display the contents in here 's the second one.
it 's been about five minutes and it looks like it 's boiling so let 's go ahead and open it up.
and this is when we 're going to add, are clams.
so let me go ahead and open up those cans of clams and will be right to your heat to medium and add two cans of clams preferably?
fresh clams would be great but i could n't find them anywhere.
so i 'm just using canned clams an whole clams is best.
i could n't find whole clams.
so i had to just settle for a chopped clams, an the recipe that justin 's grandmother grandma more gave us calls for two of these.
it 's extra clam juice and so here is my third one.
and just mix everything.
so now that you have your clams in, and it 's a medium heat you 're ready to add two cups of half and half.
so two cups.
one do an.
i like to use horizon organic half and half.
but you can use any like.
so that 's two cups of half and, half.
and you 're going to want to just go ahead and mix the contents does n't that look delicious.
now that the half and half in there at ten tablespoons of flour gradually.
so at one and mix two and mix, and you 're going to do this continuously.
this is the sixth one and as you can see the clam chowder is getting really thick.
seven does n't that look delicious.
eight , nine and years of tenth.
i 'm just going to make it a heaping.
one see that, that 's the tenth one.
i 've actually like eleven, and then you 're going to stir, i like to use my little hot pad, so as you can see it 's really thick.
you can add more flour if you like it much more thicker.
but i think this is perfect because it 'll get thick throughout like it 'll get thick in time.
look at that does n't look amazing, does not look good time.
yum , we 're going to add two teaspoons of porchester sauce, worchester sauce.
i ca n't say it.
so i had to have justin say so.
two teaspoons, one two, oh, and it looks like this by the way, if i did n't get it grab that spatula an mix the contents.
next you 're going to add any hot sauce that you like in our favorite at home, is the sriracha hot chili sauce?
and i tried this recipe before which is why i decided to make a youtube video, and you 're going to just add one teaspoon.
but if you like it super spicy.
add two, but one is perfect.
i think and then if you like more just add more.
and then you 're just going to mix.
and i like to just dip that, that measuring spoon in there to get all the sauce out and it smells amazing, does n't it smell amazing honey, i 'm hungry after that i like to add a half teaspoon oops a half teaspoon of.
so after you add your salt just add a little bit of black peppercorn one two three four five it 's pretty much all i add and then i mix and honestly you are pretty much done i like to turn everything on medium and close it for a little while just i just like to have it on medium and then close it for about ten minutes.
because everything tastes much better that way and i set the timer on for ten alright it 's time to open this up it looks delicious.
and you 're pretty much all done.
just grab yourself a large bowl, pour yourself some delicious clam chatter.
i 'm going to do two scoops.
OK , honey, now that the clam chowder is all done and we 're eating it, how do you like it, it 's amazing.
it 's really, really good.
contactor is really good.
so , thank you.
