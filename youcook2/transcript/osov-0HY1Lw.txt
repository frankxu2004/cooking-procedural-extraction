hey foodies, we 're getting busy with a wonderful summertime treat.
this is all american macaroni salad now.
i know a lot of people make macaroni cell at all year round, but i love to make macaroni salad with lots of color and some great texture.
so this way you get the creamy, tangy dressing, but you also get the crunch of some fresh vegetables and the pop of some really beautiful color.
now we have already chopped up most of our vegetables, let me get this celery into its little bowl hearing.
it that all ready to go.
we also want to make sure that we get our pasta from the refrigerator.
i love making my pasta ahead of time can get it cooled and get it ready to go.
because once you start cooking the pasta want to blanch it real quickly with some cold water.
so you can make sure it stops is cooking process and it 's ready to add in once you get all your fresh ingredients prepared.
so will head over to the refrigerator, grab are four cups of cooked pasta , now.
i also like to toss this with a little olive oil because i think that keeps it from sticking together and makes it a lot easier to work with.
now , the only thing we have left to do is to shred up some karat.
so it 's a great opportunity for you to get all those great wonderful farm.
fresh vegetables, then the height of some great, great vegetables all year round.
now because you can really get great vegetables twelve months of the year in the summer time.
all those great wonderful farmers market start coming in with all their great vegetables.
so , by local, get all your great vegetables and that makes every recipe that much nicer than going to add this into our carrots and get busy to start assembling everything we need for all american macaroni salad.
now we started with four cups of elbow.
macaroni , that is already been cooked all from ready to go now, we 're going to add to that one cup red.
then we 're going to jump in with celery.
this is one cup of chopped celery from there.
we go into your green garden peas now.
these are frozen, but we 've defrosted them, and they 're ready to pop inside, and that 's one cup of frozen peas.
then we 're going to add a half cup of this beautiful chopped red pepper.
those are really great for color, then we 're going to go in with three boiled eggs and then finally one and a half cups of deli ham diced height and ready to go inside.
but do n't forget, add that ad last little bit of color all those grated carrots that we worked on this is going to come together for you, anne are carrots are one cup.
and you 're ready to go with something that 's really colorful and full of great texture.
so now we have half the macaroni salad made, let 's get busy on the dressing, the dressing is really classic and so easy to make.
i love this dressing because it combines all the creaminess year after.
plus you really love with macaroni salad, now.
let 's move our dry ingredients in the macaroni out of the way and get busy with our dressing now.
what we 've already done is put the wet ingredients inside i 'm a big fan of doing this from the start.
it really kind of speeds up the whole process.
what we have in the bowl already is our mayonnaise.
we 've got half a cup one and a half cups of mayonnaise.
we also have sour cream.
there 's three quarters of a cup of sour cream and then of course, you 've got dijon mustard.
there are two tablespoons and make sure you get that really wonderful fresh creamy, dijon mustard to give it that nice punch.
then we 're going to add in our dry ingredients.
this is so let 's get these over here, as well.
what i also have to add a little extra tang is some white vinegar.
this is three tablespoons of white vinegar add that in and that will really give it a nice punch then beyond that we 're going to add in our spices.
now we 've got sugar also.
there 's also salt and celery seed.
one teaspoon of celery seed, one tablespoon of sugar, two teaspoons of kosher salt, one teaspoon of ground, pepper and a half tablespoon of garlic powder.
so will add all of that in, and then we 're going to whisk and give this a nice stir easy dressing.
i like to tilt the bowl a little bit to the side there and get a really nice whisk in their incorporating all those spices, all of your wet ingredients.
and you can already start to smell how zesty and tangy, this is going to be now.
what i 'm going to do is add my black pepper.
last and there are a couple of reasons for that one.
i want to make sure that i get it evenly distributed because you do n't want to clump up inside.
and i 'm also going to make sure that incorporate that up high when you add your spices up.
high you get more even coverage from our measuring spoon, and just give a nice shake up high and going to evenly distributed and wish that back in.
so there 's all of our pepper.
if that all worked in and now for the hard part.
we 're just going to add in the other ingredients.
not anything so hard about this at all, so will take this to the side.
my hands a wipe and start incorporating in all of these other ingredients.
remember all your dry ingredients go inside along with your pasta, and you 're going to give this one great big stir, i 'd like to call this recipe a dump in stir.
because it 's so.
you 're just going to incorporate all the ingredients, and then give it a nice stir.
but remember because those peas are now to frosted, you want to incorporate this very gently.
there 's no need to get into a hurry with this.
you do n't want those peas to break apart or to mush up.
that 's a culinary term you may want to look it up.
so this is going to be a perfect way for you to add color and wonderful tanginess to a really a classic american treat macaroni salad is something that we really can enjoy all year round.
but we tend to make it and enjoy it more in the summertime perfect for backyard barbecues wonderful for holiday.
get togethers and is n't it nice.
when you make it yourself.
sure , you can go to a store and buy it premade, but that 's really not going to give it.
that 's homemade touch and when you add your own ingredients, you know exactly what 's going inside, you know, where you source them.
and , you know, right away that they 're going to be perfect for everyone who gathers around your family picnic table.
so now the only thing left shut up and enjoy let me grab a couple of bowls here.
i like working with shallow bowls, when i serve this, particularly this is going to be kind of the main event and get a nice big serving spoon.
nothing nicer than a big wooden serving spoon for a summertime meal, and be generous with this, this also keeps very nicely.
i 've often found that this is even better the next day because all the flavors have had time to kind of marinating compliment there.
we go one more for everybody at the table.
this is the perfect, perfect complement to go with any of your grilling items.
any of your summertime meals.
i always say make this ahead of time and let those flavors marinate, and you 'll come away with a colorful macaroni salad, all american colors an great texture for your.
next family, get together.
