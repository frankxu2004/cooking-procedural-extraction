hi guys, today, i 'm going to show you how to cook up some beautiful brats on the barbeque.
and it 's very easy.
you 'll need of course.
some bratwurst sausages.
now made these a couple of days ago.
so i put the link to that recipe in the description bar, of course, you can buy them from the store.
if you like some noise crusty long rolls, which are cut in half chopped onion.
some chopped bacon olive oil.
some good mustard, use your favorite here little bit of sale craps and top it off, and some beer.
now you can use your life or your dark bees for this.
both will work well, so to get started just heat a pan to a medium high heat.
add a bit of olive oil and just lightly browned those sausages.
then take off the sausages adding the bacon and the onion and just cook that for a couple of minutes until the bike and brands and the onions go translucent, then add back in the sausages.
cover them with the onion and bacon mix and pouring a beer now.
let this cook for about fifteen minutes or so on a light simmer until that beer is evaporated just like that cause.
now just give those sausages a lot sia over the coals.
and now it 's time to put together these sandwiches just spread some mustard onto the bottom of those roles, then add the brought worst followed by a good helping of that onion and bacon mix do n't forget the sauerkraut.
