in today 's episode of healthy tasty meals, i 'm going to show you a very healthy and very tasty recipe of a condiment.
i 've been getting a lot of emails on hey guys.
how are y'all doing today?
i 'm going to show you a recipe for a condiment that i 've been getting a lot of emails and in fact, the last one was just last night and i was able to tell him just hold on for twenty four hours and i 'm going to show you a very healthy and tasty recipe for homers.
i want to show you how to do this very quickly.
in fact, this video is going to be very short because it 's very easy to make this recipe.
however , it 's very healthy.
and like i 've.
now said very tasty.
so there 's no need for you to go and buy this stuff in the store that is not fresh full of preservatives comes full of sugars that 's just not healthy for you, and it 's not going to help you reach those weight loss goals that you 're looking for.
so , as always, let 's quickly run through the ingredients.
then , i 'm going to show you how to make this in about two minutes.
flat , the first ingredients, which is obviously the main ingredient is chick peas and always try and get the best quality of what every ingredient you need to put into a recipe or dish this is nice organic chickpeas and really tasty.
i 've had it before then.
you want freshly chopped parsley about a tablespoon or so, about a tablespoon of really high quality olive oil, then we 're going to have a little bit of orange, and i 'm probably just going to squeeze out one half of this orange.
then you want freshly cut and crushed garlic about a teaspoon.
if i get any of this wrong, i will put it under video for you guys.
and i 'll put all the measurements for you there in the recipe as i go through there, then we 're going to have sesame E.
seeds think about another tablespoon or so from what i can see, they have put in there and then for spicing we 're going to have some human.
we 're going to have nice some himalayan salt and peppercorns into that one as well.
but i 'm also going to add some by itself, and that you can add to taste, and.
now you 're going to do is you put all of this into your food pressure in your blender.
you mix it for about two to three minutes, and you 're all done.
so will start of chick peace, just stick all of that in going to have some parsley going to stick in that garlic sesame E seeds.
and then let 's go with that olive oil.
this smells of all these things, especially if it 's nice and fresh.
guys are always so nice.
and then i 'm literally just going to squeeze half of this orange juice in here OK.
i think it 's about a tablespoon that we 're trying to get in there and then couple of grinds.
couple of grind to himalayan salt and then but a teaspoon or so off human and now we just going to blend it all and then we all done.
hey , that looks perfect.
now i 've gone for about three minutes, and now we will simply scoop that into a little bowl steger, and this is it all ready to go.
and i can tell you it smells really nice, and the great thing.
great ingredients, very healthy, very fresh.
and , that is your home.
is all done nice and easy.
now like i said, i like to have it as a condiment as you can see here with some broccoli and some celery and carrot leaves?
and that 's how i 'll be eating it today.
it 's for me.
one of the ways that i can actually get my veggies in.
i 'm not a big veggie city, but you need to get it in so this makes it a little bit easier.
but some people actually just eat to humans by itself, and i suppose we are going to do this, this will probably be a good post workout meal.
depending on what diety on.
but if you are following the six week, six pack challenge, then this could be a post, post workout meal after about forty to forty five minute.
but that 's not how i 'm going to eat it.
i 'm having it with my veggies today.
so they go guys now, you know, how to make healthy tasty homers.
an remember, if it 's a little bit too bland for you just add some more of this spices that i showed you add some more orange juice or anything that gets that taste a few most of things we use today is for you and you ca n't really go overboard.
but now you have it now.
