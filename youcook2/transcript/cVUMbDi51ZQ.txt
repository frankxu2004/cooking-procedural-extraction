hi , everybody, i 'm rockin robin.
and today i 'm going to show you how to make spring rolls now.
these are super healthy.
they make a great appetizer and the reason there are.
so healthy is.
because they 're made with fresh vegetables and of course, you can put anything you wanted it.
so what i 'm going to be putting in mind, are some baby shrimps, carrots, cucumbers onions to name a few things.
and we 're going to serve it up with a nice spicy peanut sauce.
so i 'll be right back to show you how to do it.
are you ready to go for the ingredients, well, here we go?
so , the first thing i 'm going to show you is are dipping sauce, which will be making that first.
so we need some peanut butter.
this is sesame E seed oil soy sauce.
some sugar, now in here you ca n't really see anything.
but there is some rice vinegar in there and will need some minced fresh garlic and some saracho sauce, which you can also substitute hot chili sauce if you like.
so for the rest of our ingredients.
we are going to be using this is called.
fine rice vermis, ellie and it comes in a package, and should have this over here comes in a package like this, and you get this in the asian and asian market, and basically all you do with it is you take out the pieces going to show your piece.
this one looks like this, and it 's hard right now, and you just soak it in nice hot water for about five to ten minutes.
and it turns out like this, and you just strain out the water so it 's nice and soft.
no inside of our spring roll.
OK , so will need some carrot.
i have some cucumber here green onion, and like i said, i 'm going to be putting some shrimp into mind, this is already cooked now.
here 's what we 're going to be rolling up our spring rolls with this is rice paper.
and this is pretty interesting stuff.
let me show you a piece.
here it feels like plastic, and you see that beautiful pattern on there.
that 's when they lay the rice out on bamboo and this is what imprints on the rice.
so what we 're going to do with this is simply soak it in water for just a few minutes, just very few.
and it gets very soft and pliable.
kill our spring rolls in this and roll it up like a burrito.
now i 'm also going to be using a little bit of cilantro and some lettuce now with the lettuce.
you 're going to probably not want to use the real crispy part of the romaine.
this is romain.
here in this part here is pretty crispy.
an it might make it difficult to roll your spring roll pleasant might break the rice paper covering.
so a butter lettuce would be really nice anything with a soft leaf.
and then i 'm also going to be using a little bit of basil touch.
let 's go ahead and start off with the dipping sauce like i mentioned, and.
so we 're going to place all those ingredients in my food processor.
so first end goes the peanut butter.
the soy sauce the sesame E seed oil.
it has a nice roasted flavor.
the rice vinegar the garlic, the sugar, and i do n't know if i mentioned early i 'm not throwing a little bit of cilantro, some of that garlic there.
and i 'm going to give a squirt of saracho sauce, you know, just put in as much as you like, how much heat you like to is more of a trial and error kind of thing, so, when this up, you know, what i want to do is, go in and scrape this down.
now right now this sauce is a little thick and.
so i 'm a thin it down a little bit with some water to get the consistency a little thinner.
so you can see right here that this is really, really thick and that does n't make for a good dipping sauce does it.
so we 're going to add a little water to that and by a little, i mean, probably a tablespoon.
and we 're just going to work it in until we get the consistency.
we want so just keep stirring it around it 's getting there.
i think i 'm gonna add.
just a little bit more water, and of course, if you wanted even thinner that 's good, but i think this is a nice consistency here.
and this will just set this aside until we 're ready to eat our spring rolls now that we have our peanut sauce made now.
we just need to chop up and get everything prepared.
so it 's ready to go into the spring rolls.
so let 's start off with our onions go ahead and chop off the root end and a little bit of the other end.
and you just want to dice this up the other option.
could would be and i find this easier is to cut this into strips?
but i think cutting it and icing, it works, well now for the carrots.
you have a couple of different options you can either pilum or not i did n't peel this one.
because it 's organic and one option is if you have a peeler like this one that has the ridges right here i 'll show you.
what how it works.
you see how it just makes little julian pieces.
it 's really nice, there nice and small.
i personally do n't like a big chunk of carrot, so this works well, if you do n't have this, let me do a couple more swipes.
it 's pretty cool how that works, and you just go around, rotate your carrot.
now if you do n't have this, i 'll show you what you can do with your knife cut off a piece.
it 's, you know, because this thing rolls around a lot.
it 's nice to cut a wedge so that now your care it 'll just sit solid.
and it 's not going to roll around on you in that piece.
you cut off you can just do some real fine cheap shopping on it and get real nice thin pieces.
you want your pieces.
then i think now let 's move on to the cucumber.
i 'd like to peel mine again.
it , you know, you want them to fit into your rice paper so you might want to cut this into thirds just to be sure.
then , i 'm going to cut it in half and i 'm just going to cut very thin pieces.
if you do n't like the seeds, you can leave those out, it does n't bother me.
so i leave them in the other option is to use the peeler like we did with the carrots.
it will break it up into small little threads like that, if you like that, it just depends on how you want it to be in whatever 's easier for you.
now for the lettuce, and i told you i was n't going to use the very crunchy part of the leaves.
so i 'm just going to tear off the software part into pieces.
i 'll just be able to lay that into the spring roll next we have the basel, so with the basel.
i 'm just going to tear the leaves into small pieces.
that way i can just kind of spread this out.
i do n't want to big an entire leaf in one spot.
i 'd like to just kind of put little pieces across it in our last thing is the cilantro, so this pretty much, just going to leave.
it just tear off a little bit in place, it on your spring roll, so we, gotta bunch there.
so now we 're ready to start making spring rolls.
so what i have here is i have a pie plate filled with some water, and it 's just luke warm water.
and i have one and see here.
we got one of the rice papers.
so i 'm going to place it into the water.
and i 'm only going to place one at a time.
we 're going to make one at a time, and i 'm going to leave it in here.
i 'm just going to keep my hands in here.
because i can feel it getting softap.
now right now, it 's still you can even hear it, it 's not soft enough yet.
so i want to show you what that looks like probably takes twenty seconds.
or so i 'm not sure, OK.
i think we 're ready.
lay it down here on the cutting board and spread it out as best you can.
it 's hard to see right now.
i do n't know if you can see it, but it 's pretty transparent here on the board now the first thing you put down, is?
what 's going to be the most noticeable.
so i want to put down some shrimp first, so that, that will be seen OK.
so i just put a few across just like that, and then i 'll probably add, oh, maybe a little bit of care.
it new sprinkled across you do n't want to make it too big because you get a lot of things to add.
put some of the kukes down like that, and we have the vermis, ellie play everything goes directly across it 's just like building a burrito.
here 's a little onion and little bit of basil little bit of cilantro, and if you do n't like cilantro guys, just leave it out.
you could do parsley.
you could even do mint, mint is really nice, too.
so you can play with this, and like i said, you can put anything you want in these things now.
some lettuce, i was even thinking about pudding some nuts in here.
i think that would be really nice.
so that 's that part all right so now i 'm going to fold it up.
i 'm going to pick it pick up the skin here and you wanted to be tight.
so i 'm going to tuck it in tight OK and roll it over.
and once you make a roll over now you can do the edges, fold the edges in that.
keep some nice and tight folding the other one and then you can continue to roll it up alright just like that pretty simple right, and then i 'll just sit this over here on my plate.
so that 's all.
there is to make in spring rolls pretty simple and pretty flexible dish, i mean, you can add like i said anything you want to put in there i 'm going to go ahead and take a little taste.
i 'm getting kind of hungry tips.
some of that into the sauce what a delicious, healthy thing to eat guys.
i hope you try this and i hope this helps you out, you know, how to fold them and how to do it.
