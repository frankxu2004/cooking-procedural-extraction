when i tell you that making perfect hash browns is eazy, i mean, it there was only one ingredient, but there is one rule.
and that rule is it takes thirty minutes to make hash browns.
and , i mean, it thirty minutes if you do n't have thirty minutes make toast.
i 'm going to show you how easy it is to make crispy on the outside moist on the inside hash browns every time, and we 're going to start by peeling a potato now.
i 'm going to peel a, this is a russet potato or a baking potato.
and this is the potato of choice for hash browns.
but i have made them with uconn gold and red potatoes whatever sometimes whatever i have on hand, and i 've had just as much luck with that, too.
but these stretchy ones are the ones that are usually recommended.
so one russet potato OK.
now that looks pretty good.
OK , there 's my peeled potato.
and now we 're going to do is a great.
the potato and this is the perfect size right here.
this , i do n't know what this is called.
but that size of hole on the greater is perfect, because if you use a whole two small you 'll get mushy potatoes if it 's too big.
they wo n't cook so this is the perfect size.
so you just great it takes maybe a minute to one big russ, it, like this, OK.
so we 're getting close to the end here.
and of course, you have to be careful.
i do n't mind wasting a little bit of potato.
but i try to throw away the last little bit.
so that i do n't cut my fingers.
so there it is it 's one grated potato, and this is how much look at how much you get from one russet potato, like that, that should be enough, just for me.
you think i 'm kidding.
i love hash browns.
now this is an important step.
we 're going to get the moisture out of this are these potato, potato button as we 're doing that.
we 're going to preheat the pan because i have you get the biggest pan.
you have this is my big, big huge pan preheat.
it to about the medium high, and i 'm going to put in like about a teaspoon of olive oil.
OK , that 's it no need to use butter heart healthy olive oil.
now this is the fun part and the important part.
we 're going to take this, the potatoes.
and we 're going to get as much moisture out as possible, and it might take more than one time.
OK , so i have four ply of paper towels here.
and so i just kind of spread them out like that, and i roll them up.
and you just squeeze out the moisture.
you can see it 's already on the cloth like that, and there 's quite a bit in here.
so if you get this much moisture in the paper towel we 're going to do it again.
so i will put another towel down here.
i know it 's, it 's messy, but it does take some commitment.
it 's really important to get all the moisture out, so this potato is requiring two rulings.
like that, so you just spread it out, so it gets touches as much of the paper, you know, what i 'll do.
i 'm going to take even extra paper.
towels go like this on top and then roll it, and that should do it.
that should do it, squeeze it, and there 's no more.
there 's very little moisture coming out to the towel.
sorry about my nest look at this, and then i put them in a, in a bowl just so i can kind of fluff them up a little bit.
and gives me.
a place to kind of add the salt and pepper so that 's.
it you just kind of brush it off the paper OK now and i can pick up these pieces OK.
so there it is it 's nice and dry this, and it 's not very wet at all, and all you do is just add a little salt and pepper to taste.
but do n't put too much in.
so i 'll put a little bit of salt in and a little bit of pepper and while you 're doing that i could do it with my hand 'cause it 's kind of it keeps a kind of light and fluffy OK.
so it 's all mixed up.
and now the pan should be preheated.
and it 's a non stick pan so i just kind of shake the olive oil around a little bit to move it around and then that 's what you want to hear they go on the pan and i do this by.
hand , too and just kind of make it so it 's fairly even throughout.
and then i just kind of bring in the.
edges , so because the edges will get browner, so i just kind of bring them in a little bit.
give a little bit of a nice shape.
now i turn it down too.
their turn, it down to medium, low and.
now fifteen minutes before you touch him, you turn him over once and witten cooking another fifteen minutes.
so you have to wait fifteen minutes, an, i mean, it, i 'm not kidding, you go make the bed go make coffee drink coffee.
i do n't care, but fifteen minutes.
you do n't touch me.
do n't turn him do nothing?
do n't make me come over there?
fifteen minutes baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, i love it.
OK , it 's been fifteen minutes.
first , you want to check the bottom, which we 're going to do.
but see how the edges are nice and brown and i think depending on you have to figure out what your stove and your pan work at this is like between medium and medium low.
so i 'm going to check the bottom.
can you see that OK, now this is a big thing a hash browns?
i 'm gonna try and flip it over, OK, wish me luck here.
i go ready and there look at that.
how awesome is that, that 's exactly what they should look like they smell good.
and if you 're nervous about when is this big, you may have to cut it to flip it over.
but when it 's cooked right and brown it holds it together.
so if you have to you can just take a special and slice it and flip it over now, when i also do is i add i scooted over to the side.
a little bit and again you want to use the biggest pan that you have and again a little bit more olive oil.
it will help it really crisp up and brown just and then you 'll see that 's nice and hot.
and then i just kind of run it down like that, turn it around.
that gets it all over and there.
we are now here 's the deal.
fifteen minutes do n't touch it.
do n't turn it do n't just leave it alone?
i 'll be back in fifteen.
OK , it 's been thirty minutes you still want to check underneath and make sure they 're done.
but it 's looking pretty good.
let 's take a peek under there, look at that nice and brown and crisp fantastic, turn off the stove.
bring it over here.
and it slides right off my nonstick pan.
now seriously look it does not get any better than this look at that.
crispy golden hash browns.
here 's the thing no butter heart.
healthy , olive oil, only three things to remember squeeze out the moisture preheat.
the pan an thirty minutes.
that 's what it takes to make these beautiful awesome, oh, my god if only i had to work, but i do n't look at this.
can you hear that, that 's, that 's it right there?
perfect hash browns.
you , gotta try it thirty minutes, i mean, it i 'll come to your house.
