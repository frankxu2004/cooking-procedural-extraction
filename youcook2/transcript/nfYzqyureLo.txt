muscles are usually something you associate with french or belgian cuisine today.
i twist as with the classic mormon.
yeah , we need a broth to cook our muscles in.
and this time it 's going to be thai style.
so we 've got all these fantastic ingredients that classical user tie that will make a stock without coconut milk and will steam with muscles in there as well, so, it will start without ginger lemongrass and garlic.
now if you can just pee, and roughly chop that 's same with the garlic and with lemongrass and just take that outer husk off and what 's left to actually just chop up nice and small cool down that much so, meanwhile on this side to do the onion, and chili, you can, of course.
but all these ingredients into a blender and actually make a paste or, in fact, user type place you can buy from supermarket.
so just a splash of oil in there to start out flying off.
and i 'm going to get out onions in to start with the chili, are quite like this digital heat.
so i 'm going to keep seeds in as well, entirely your choice, let me give you a little hand with those limits.
you , too much there.
thank you so our lemongrass, nice and find each other, you know, that i love this middle english.
so that can go into there with all of our ginger and garlic, and will just keep it all moving and what we put the lid on there to help its team people concentrate on our muscles now.
these are not those shellfish so some people get bit concerned by which ones they can and ca n't eat unless it 's very, very simple.
if there are any that are broken not worth, i mean, probably still alive.
but for the sake of a broken bit, which might get shot of shell in there just get rid of it that really cheap that 's what we do.
so if you can just pick through those any clouds.
the chance that it 's alive.
it 's just shut up OK, if later on, when we cooked it, it still closed, then we wo n't try and force open, depending on what time of year.
you get your muscles, they will have either lots of beard or less.
so it tends to be a factor of the seasons.
i just got stuck in.
there i left and moved.
shaved something like that not quite your beard.
so if you can just finish up sifting through those.
because the rest of japan is nearly read it, and then we fried those up at which point we can add in our coconut milk, soaked in coconut milk, and that 's just going to bubble away in there.
i was going to cook and steam.
all of our muscles and comes a great source of diplomat at the end a little splash of fish.
source , using their battle tablespoon and a splash of soy sauce.
and as you cook these all the juices from the muscles leap into that.
source , you get a really kind of fishing thai flavor comes from shellfish.
so we let that come up to boil.
we can just press some of the ingredients for later.
that 's a little bit of fresh coriander and align measuring body fishy bits.
but if you can just slice that in heart and squeeze it later on.
so now you can see all of that popping, up there plenty of steam at which point pulled muscles, and i some clean and go into our pan.
like so give it one step.
just a coat over those in the flavors.
but the link back on and allowed to cook and steve about three to four minutes all the muscles need to open up and then we can serve.
that 's all it takes a couple minutes to open up all of those muscles you can see how quickly they open up.
there 's two portions in here looks like an awful lot.
but obviously you only to meet your not using the shell.
do n't want too much of the source at the moment?
importing is getting all those muscles, and then what 's left in the pan.
if you can squeeze our live in two and a fresh coriander uniform see that good stuff.
and that 's essentially this final sort of fresh seasonings and then we can put some of that ladled.
stocks got all that beautiful muscly fisher juice now over the top as well, so there 's plenty to dunkin to it smells ridiculously amazing, ridiculously amazing.
that 's what we like it.
that 's what we 're aiming for.
and finish it with our final bit of lemon grass.
so there we go and awesome bowl full of muscles with inspired thai flavor, sorted it 's kind of messy food.
but you just gotta get stuck in those are group is the balance with my favorites.
got the lime juice soy sauce, and chili, the lemongrass is fragrantly sorting it 's sweet.
it 's by sleep, so everything i love it.
