hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with the ultimate, mashed potatoes.
this is dedicated to everyone who 's posting a no fat or low-fat mashed potato recipe for the holidays, please food gods, forgive them for, they know, not what they do.
because not only are holiday.
table mashed potatoes supposed to have butter in it.
there supposed to have a ridiculous amount of butter in it.
so that 's exactly what i 'm going to show you how to do.
but fair warning we 're about to witness can never be unseen, but if you think you 're up for it let 's get started here.
make sure you get potatoes that there this same size right all.
three of these potatoes were just over a pound, each which means once.
i trim going to have about three pounds of potatoes to work with, which is going to make about eight generous portions.
and then, once those are appealed were going to order them and to do?
will cut it in half and by the way, the potato tapers little bit always cut the taper down to little longer.
see that i did n't go exactly in half right that will compensate a little bit for the difference in girth.
so we 'll cut him in half will cut those halves in half.
and that 's a pretty good method for getting even size pieces by the way in our original masturbating video, we cut them.
in half lengthwise dated and then once those potatoes are caught, we 're going to rinse them very thoroughly.
in fact, you may have noticed a little dirt on my fingers when i 'm peeling and cutting those.
i only rinse my potatoes once because you have to rinse the starch off.
when there cut anyway why bother rinsing them before you peel, 'em that 's like doubling your work and yes.
it was a long way to go to explain that little spot of dirt on my finger.
so , once those are rinsed, thoroughly, we 're going to drain him and dump them into our product cold water.
they were going to generously salt by the way, like very generously.
so our ultimate match pigs are actually going to start off season and will go ahead and bring that up to a boil on the highest possible.
so just our heat to maintain a nice steady simmer and will cook these until perfectly tender and since that 's going to take a little while we can go ahead and prep are butter and i hope you 're sitting down.
because that 's how much.
we 're going to use that is one pound of european butter, also known as the expensive butter, but it is gorgeous, very low water content.
it almost has a clay like texture, but anyway, we 're going to take a pound of butter.
we 're going to cut it up in chunks, and it 's very critical.
this butter comes up to room temperature, it would be perfect if this butter got up to like sixty, sixty five degrees.
we 've crunched the numbers yet.
but yes, we 're doing a three to one ratio, three pounds of potatoes to one pound of butter, and i realized that sounds completely insane.
but on the blog post, i 'm going to explain why that 's not only not insane.
but it is an incredibly rational and absolutely reasonable thing to do so.
please check that out especially if you 're a fan of airtight arguments, so are butters, prepped and will head back over to the stove to check our potatoes.
and we really want these to be tender, so carefully check with a spoon.
and i 've that knife should go in with effort, i mean, there 's just nothing more evil than mashed potatoes with chunks of uncooked potato in it.
yes , worse than satan way worse.
going to make sure these are very tender at that point.
we 're going to drain them very thoroughly.
we do n't want any water in here and yes.
if they 've been cooked enough, they 're going to collapse like that, that does not mean there.
that means they 're perfectly cooked all we 're going to jump in are very well drained.
potatoes were going to turn our heat on to medium.
low , we definitely want to keep some heat under this.
and we 're going to start matching with a wire potato masher.
check it out, accept no substitutes.
old wire potato masher.
nothing works is good and during this first phase, all we 're doing is breaking him up right.
there 's no butter.
there 's no milk just go round until you think their mashed, oh, by the way, one of the great things about having this much butter in the recipe you do n't really have to worry about overmixing case who do not be concerned over working this is going to be perfect.
so , after that initial matching will go ahead and dumped in some pepper, and some salt.
and we 're going to adjust the seasoning later.
but i know, i 'm going to need some, and will also throw in about a quarter of the butter chunks and will go ahead and mix that up with the measure until the butter, just about disappears.
i forget throughout this entire process.
your heat is on medium low.
we want to keep everything.
nice and hot do n't forget that.
but there 's only room temperature.
and once that first edition of butters mashed in we 're going to switch to a wire whisk we 're going to dump in another corner of the butter, going to mix that in, with the whisk when it almost disappears at the.
next quarter of butter and simply repeat until all the butter 's gone.
so in a way.
this is almost like we 're doing a butter sauce were mixing in the butter, and it 's kind of emulsifying in, and you 'll notice when you get down to that.
last addition to butter things are getting really light and creamy in awesome looking first edition of butters whipped in order, go ahead and finish this with just a splash of hot milk, just like a quarter cup.
i microwave mine.
and that 's just going to lighten up and loosen things up.
just a touch and will give that one last whipping, and at this point you 're really, really going to want to grab a fork, not only to taste one of the most delicious things in the history of the universe.
but you have to taste and adjust the seasoning at this points.
listen to me now in hear me later if this does not have enough solved it will not taste good.
so i was almost perfect.
but it did need a little more salt and the obligatory shake, a cayenne.
then we can go ahead and turn off our heat and serve.
so go ahead and transfer those into your tater bowl do not garnish with anything except possibly a few chives.
and that 's only if you 're taking pictures.
this needs absolutely nothing, especially if you 're serving, it is part of a big holiday meal and yes when you bring that to the table.
people will be thinking those mashed potatoes.
are n't white there almost butter colored that 's probably just the light?
i 'm sure it does n't look that way from insane amounts of butter.
but it does and seriously.
one taste and it will all make sense.
it is just beyond description reason all those michelin star chefs make their potatoes.
this way because they 're just.
so above and beyond what we usually enjoys mashed potatoes that they almost become another type of food some kind of butter, potato hybrid.
but a to actually work on that.
so if you 're into enjoying and sharing with your guests, a proper bowl of mashed potatoes this holiday season, i really hope you give these a try head over to food wishes, dot com for all the ingredient amounts and more info is usual, and as oeis enjoy.
