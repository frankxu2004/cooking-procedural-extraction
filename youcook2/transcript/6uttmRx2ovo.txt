hi , welcome to my kitchen.
today , i 'm going to share with you and recipe for another paroki.
those are my favorite.
we call it parochial scale, which would mean russian pirogi.
and they 're made with pressed cottage cheese onions and potatoes and again.
the recipes from my mom.
let 's have a look at the ingredients so you know, what you need i am starting with preparing my potatoes i 'm going to peel them off OK.
and then i 'm going to cut them in half just to make them easier for a boiling kaden in my large pot.
i added water and some salt.
now i 'm adding my potatoes, and i 'm going to be pulling them for around half an hour until there tender, and i 'm going to be checking them with the fork, if they 're easily sliding often means they already OK.
so , let 's fish them out.
and then we letting them cool a little bit so it 's easier to handle them.
and in the mean time we take care of our own and i 'm going to chop it very finely and then on my frying pan, and adding around two tablespoons of oil and then on the medium, medium heat, i 'm adding my onion, and they 'll be cooking it for around five minutes.
i think until it gets nice and soft and transparent and starts turn turning cold here.
yeah , that 's how it looks like when it 's ready now my potatoes cool down there little bird.
i do n't want them to be called because then it 's harder to press them.
but they have still warm.
but not burning, and i 'm pressing them through my potato prayers, and then i 'm pressing my cheese and when this is ready, i 'm transferring everything into my larger mixing bowl and then adding the onion OK, and.
now it 's time for mixing here.
we 're going to be mixing it until all its nicely incorporated hey.
i 'm checking for seasoning and then adding salt and pepper parochial scare.
i have to be nicely salted not too much.
but they cannot be not enough salted, and they need pepper as well, i did n't put too much just.
because i 'm hoping sebastian will eat some.
but in the recipe, you should, you should put more kaden are switching to work the staffing with my hands , OK.
and i 'm working it until i 'm sure that everything is well mixed up.
OK , then into my foot profit processor, i 'm adding my flower, an i have boiled water ready in my mag it 's not boiling hot.
but it 's still warm i 'm adding a teaspoon of salt and.
now i 'm going to post it a little bit.
so the salt will mix with the flower, and when this is ready, slowly, i 'm going to be adding the water watching what 's happening with the door and when the, when the dole is forming a bowl and then it 's ready we do n't need any more water, and i will check also if it 's soft enough and if it is soft enough, then we still wanna run it for around one minute in the food processor, processor.
so it gets nice inelastic he would go and checking that is, nice and soft.
but it needs a thirty seconds forty five seconds more OK, when this is done in my large pod i added water am adding a teaspoon of salt and i want to bring it to boil, while i 'm working on my dough OK.
so this is half of the, of the dough the other half i packed up nicely in a zip lock bag.
so it does n't dry out go it 's nice and elastic you put some flower if you need if it 's a little bit sticky put more flower.
but in my case, it was not sticking to the table and then with the rolling pin, we going to be rolling it and i think it should be between one and two millimeters.
but it does depends on what you like my, mom, likes them much dinner.
i like them a little bit thicker that 's how my grandma used to make pirogue, but it 's a lot of a lot of rolling here.
we go and some time to time.
we want to flip the flipped it over.
so it does n't stick to our table came from the half of the half of the, though it 's going to be around twenty, twenty P rock on my serving plate, imputing some flower.
because i 'm going to be pulling my pirocchi that and i do n't want them to get stuck i have my staffing ready and right.
now with the class, i 'm cutting circles here we go when that 's ready.
i 'm going to remove the remaining roll, and i 'm going to stuff it in their little zip lock bag.
so i can roll it again and then have few more perogies now, i have my nice scope exam one tablespoon size.
and i 'm picking up my dough, stretching it a little bit, flipping it over.
so the site, which was laying on the table right.
now it 's on top.
so it 's easier to close it, it seals better OK, and for this pirogue, i do n't like to have any decoration.
the pierog it 'll scare for me looks best when they 're just simple.
like this OK and again tablespoon of stuffing.
and we stretching our though and sealing it, do n't put too much of a staffing.
because if it touches the edges, then you wo n't be able to seal the perraki now.
our bottle water is boiling.
so we 're going to being to be putting all our pirogue inside.
just make sure that you do n't crowd it too much.
you need to have a big pod, and then after that, we need to give it a gentle stare with the wooden spoon.
just so they do n't get stuck to the bottom of the pot.
OK , my plate.
i 'm going to spray with nonstick spray and have it ready for the P.
rocky , when they float to the top another one minute, and they 're ready he would go an off to go to the plate K in.
here goes the last one.
and right now we need to put some, some oil on top of our pirogue.
i 'm spraying just a non stick, spray, but my mom using a brush and just brushing them.
you could also use the battery if you prefer OK and for serving, i 'm chopping some bacon and some onion into small pieces.
here we come this is my best way of serving it, it 's with fried bacon with some onion.
but you can just fry simply pier, occupy themselves.
or you can say serve them fresh from the water with some sour cream, OK.
now on my frank pan i 'm puting the.
bacon , and i 'm going to be cooking it until it gets nice and crisp.
OK , give it a stir from time to time.
so does n't get stuck to your frying pan, the bacon is almost ready.
and i 'm adding my onion and now.
i 'm going to be cooking it until the onion turns kind of golden brown.
and it 's soft in that caramelized, and then we just pour it over our pierogi and fallout that 's how it looks like i hope you enjoy the recipe.
and you give it a.
try , let me know what you think.
and i will see you next time bye.
