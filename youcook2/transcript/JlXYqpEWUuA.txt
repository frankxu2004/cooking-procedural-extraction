sausage is a good way to do them is with her tomorrow and onion gravy in their own gravy.
it 's the frying poaching, sourcing metric.
you 've got to have.
i want to do is that i got natural casings on them right natural casings are very important, so as in very good quality, sausages, you like fifty years.
the ones that have the sort of artificial pricing when you 're talking with this by the case in a lot of christ there, olive oil just helps them from dopson, sticking and you want to get a nice brown color on the outside, go barry about whether or not their cooked on the inside.
you just want to caramelize.
that 's the key.
caramelize home town brown.
we pull up browning in this house, so this actually needs to be done on a fairly low peaks.
one onion decent size quite.
because i 'm nice thickish, all this can stick a stick, also beautiful the sausages alright over there good to do them on a live heat.
otherwise down that will burn quite easily.
one of a very convincing browns trips because it 's approaching method, the brownless can actually watch off and you broke.
and this is what gives the gravy.
it 's later that around the side and that could cook nicely, a better tried some potatoes on for mash.
other thoughts with matches, tobago, i do n't know.
you cite sebago ice age.
the bargo, i need the feeling is the photos over there so to speak very funny.
inability squeezable switched a tiger.
what you can do is, well as you can make the ones that are on the inside to the outside.
but the ones on the outside closer to the heat.
they tell you the chemistry minute.
i want to exploit their sausages.
there are you think of the shape of the sausage right you got, a thin edge in contact with the fry pan.
all the time, which means that there 's not a lot of surface area for the heat to get in and cook the sausage.
so you are a flipping all the time or the other thing that people do is just sit there and burn the crap out of it.
so that it 's cooked on the inside.
but then it 's all burton horrible on the outside why not do it i 'm about to do which is get some program with that cameras out there 's some water right after watering that 's not too much that we 're finishing off the cooking by you should 've put bordering really.
but it will come to the boil by essentially just poaching them in the hot water and then the little bit of juice and flavor that comes out in the water we 've got left from with finish will use to make gravy my love i 'm sorry, well, if that 's just kind of the title is just going to be pulling alive they will swap about decide that this is on, yeah, thank you that needs to reduce.
now take it off completely.
so what are we doing where eliminating some of the water that dummy over porn after that completely exonerated that other person gave him a glass from the water and said put that in there.
you need about, you know, however, much greater you want couple cup and a half something like that with the models will any zaidi.
because sausages can be a bit salty, and the tomatoes the acidity in the sweetness of the tomatoes just takes away the saltiness of your gravy goal is here.
no , i thought it was going to sound, scandalize to CS.
four months never was, that 's fine, as it is for now.
was tomorrow 's have inch uncle five?
you could also service, instead of with potato masher could serve with polenta, they also be very nice.
now that 's getting down to the sort of level.
we want and as i said the tomatoes will help tighten why the saltiness reserve, the sausages.
you just put them on the grill and now sort of re brown.
what about them.
and they do n't just soften up the tomatoes and get them to release, release their juices, not reduce their jesus time.
let the tomatoes were lost their jesus.
i must retain their jesus at all.
what are you doing scene?
and you 'd like to pick it up.
just mix a little bit of flour with cold water antipodeans towards the egg sort all.
my code with the gravy being a bit seem to be honest to run through a season, the word unctuous planes, oily and repulsive can mean oily in the physical as in oleaginous, or it can mean oily in us like a sort of a person.
is a bit.
slimy , and a bit too ingratiating.
it is still a bit watering.
it means just might be a bit and also i think that 's a bit much tomato.
other people, too much tomorrow, actually it makes salt and pepper nothing very old.
i 've got this along time.
it 's cold storage for about ten years, while we 've been overseas.
and that 's still not actually have the steelixite, peppercorns in it?
or , did the cyclical neurons.
well , i just want to quickly do that, been there, and i really want you gotta be careful with that every week and burn yourself there on that clear.
the been there.
my typing this bob water now, that is, actually, starting to.
yeah , that 's good, i just after you turn that off now, please.
been there done that more puns are getting more rancid.
are they real?
which is still using an advertising words.
it 's really annoying for granted franklin die.
no , you 're the one who brought all the edginess into this, or whatever the word laws.
i did n't say all the happiness.
i said unctuous outside a bit of free cracked pepper.
yeah , i just found that has a slightly different flavor, there is sort of ripping to some extent layer.
what is demurely crossed pair of legs OK on a permit and troubled person?
no , yum, yum, yeah, outside the kated cooking, sausages.
now your sausage, like you can have caught this before laying high and sometimes if you like if you poach the sausages, too long they sort of end up a bit wizened in a bit, you know, like you cook, too much, too much of the moisture is coming out and gone into the gravy that should have stayed in the sausage.
but natural casing is the key the manufactured casings, they might still side their natural.
but they are made from collagen or something and, they 've got a sheen to them in a plastic he dropped it.
stay away from that, and obviously the quality of the sausages key if you use a cheap sausage that 's got the sort of softap really, finally meets the mushy middle.
it 's not like toothpaste, toothpaste sausage, but i do feel you have to learn your sausage.
you find one that you like, yeah, i agree now, your sausage.
