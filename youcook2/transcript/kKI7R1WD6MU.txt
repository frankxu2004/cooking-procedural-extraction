hi , this is penny and welcome back to the pen english kitchen.
clearly i 'll show you how to make a wonderful food shower crap.
it 's a pro biotic dish that when you eat it actually improves your florida which actually makes your body healthier in general, on top of that.
if you have a hard time digesting cabbage when you eat flower crap, it 's much more digestible and does n't usually give stomach issues this error.
code is different than the stuff that they sell in the store because the specialist on the storage pasteurized and therefore does n't have the beneficial probiotics in it.
but when you eat this homemade sauerkraut, it is very good and healthy for you.
it 's really not a big deal to make it all and let me show you how all you need to make shower craft is these heads of cabbage.
we notice these heads of cabbage.
are one of them is not hold?
and that really that 's OK, i actually had to stab is sitting in my refrigerator for a little bit.
and i kind of forgot about them.
yeah , but i just cut out the bad part.
you could still use the rest is not very hard at all, because cabbage that comes in layers you just peel off the bad ones, and you slip inside.
you cut the cabbage along this way, leaving at the core.
it does n't really matter how small you cut it because it will break up even smaller when you get it ready.
so i 'm just cutting wide strips like that, and then second is doing this for both heads of cabbage.
then we 'll move on to the next part.
OK , so i finish cutting up the cabbage.
i put in this large cast iron pot.
i have it does n't have to be cast iron.
i just prefer to do it in cast iron.
because what 's going to be.
next is going to be lots of physical work, and if you could use the regular plastic container, they could start flying.
so i prefer something heavier, but if you do n't have a cast iron pot, any big container will work.
you see, this course over here.
that 's what i have left.
do n't throw those out and put them in soup maker brought out of them, you could even now, what you need.
next is just some salt and a big soon like that?
i do n't use their crap calendar.
i just use a wooden spoon.
and it works just as well.
now this part is pretty messy.
i just have to go getting the crap like this.
sorry , it makes a lot of noise too, and you 're going to put himself.
i 'm not measuring exactly how much because i 'll fix the amount of salt later right now just put in a little bit.
of course and then start pounding pounds of the crap a lot of the way then you start using your.
hands , it 's really a little hard work, but it 's also worth it because some enerji and, you know, we have so much extra energy.
we have to burn somehow.
so why not do it this.
now is they actually want to release the juices in the cabbage so you can either punch it like, you know, think of someone.
you 're mad at and start punching the.
cabbage , or just that squeezing it, you know, i think it 's something you really want to squeeze down the sound just joking.
but either way if you want to get as much juice out of there as possible if you want sour cat to be good.
you want the cabbage juice to be the most of them liquid from the sarah patton, not water.
i 've actually made sarah pept, both without handing.
it and with handing it and when you pound.
it , it actually, it spoiled less quickly.
whereas when you do n't pound it, it fits on both spoil.
faster , you see.
i finished pounding it and squeezing it and see how much liquid.
is here at the bottom that 's a liquid that you want to have at this point you actually want to be tasting it uhm.
no need more shots the way, you know, how to need more salt, or not that you wanted to be salty.
but not too salty that it makes you gross that because you want to have salt in it to stop the bad bacteria from.
growing , but if you have children short in it and the good bacteria can grow either.
so you want to add enough salt.
so it 's kind of like pickles.
but not way too salty that it 's unpalatable.
so there 's exact measurements for how much salt should add.
but i usually just do it.
now that i finished adding the salt, an, I taste it to make sure it 's the right saltiness.
add other spices if you want, the traditional european ways to add caraway seeds and mustard or some people add bay leaf if you want to make it more asian inspired you could add some ginger and garlic and scallions and hot peppers.
but i 'm just choosing to leave us playing for now.
we have to pack everything.
and so container i used a mason jar.
i 'm aware that there 's some controversy in the real food world about using mason jars for ferments.
but i do n't really care.
they say that using mason jars is not really good.
therefore you get an aerobic fermentation instead of an anaerobic fermentation and all sorts of things like that, but, you know, what people have been using sarah care facility built into the years then they never use a special pickle at jar that prevent that check out all the oxygen.
so i 'll just keep on doing with people always did it and just pack it in my jar and no one has not developed any mold and i 'm not worried about that.
so just pack it into the jar accent makes a mess and to do that.
if you have a big funnel that will help also clean up afterwards.
no point doing it now, because it will just make a bigger mess pack it in push.
if we have little circuit, there 's two heads of cabbage made now once you finish packing up the cabbage deep, or in the liquid see how much liquid.
this is just from just in the cabbage.
there 's no added liquid here now, the brian is covering the cabbage up, and now.
if you wanted you could add a little bit extra salt on the top to decimate any bacteria from growing there.
and then you leave it on the shelf now not in the refrigerator, you leave it on the shop in a somewhat warm place for about.
i do n't know a few days to some month.
even you leave it there to ferment, and you 'll notice it in a few days will start getting more shower, and i do n't want to write shower dish, you could either eat it, or you could let it ferment a little longer, if you do n't want to eat.
it right then, but you want to leave it that much fermented just put in the refrigerator once in the refrigerator and allows the good long.
while and now had to wash my hands.
