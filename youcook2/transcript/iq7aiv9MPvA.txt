hello , everybody welcome back to my channel, my name is kisha.
i blog everyday at K jaggers dot com.
the link to my blog is below so today i am back sharing a recipe.
a crock pot recipe, that is four eight delicious soft taco stack that you can either help along on the stove and take minimal time in the crockpot or you can do it all in the crockpot.
i 'm going to explain the process all the way through.
and this is a little bit in conventional in the sense of how i 'm sharing it.
i 'm not going to go through all of the different ingredients of front.
i 'm going to share them as we, as we need them throughout the video.
and i will have everything written out in a corresponding blog post that you will be able to get to by clicking the link below in the down bar.
and you 'll be able to have the recipe in full, that is, printable for your family to enjoy, so let 's get started.
i 'm going to show you how to make this delicious taco stack, even though this is a crockpot meal one of the nice things about this particular dinner is you do n't have to get it in the crockpot super early if you do n't want to.
so what i like to do for this recipe is go ahead and get the beef cooked up with the onions that way, it does n't have to be in the crockpot all day, you do n't have to transfer and then layer the taco stack up you can layer it simply out of this pot.
so all i have in here is about two sounds of cube steak and if you did want to make it, you know, in the crockpot all the way you would cut your cube steak up and put it in your crockpot with one onion and then you would add some sauce, and i will explain that in a minute, the enchilada sauce turn that on and let it cook for about five hours into your meat is nice and tender.
so you can do that you will have to take it out transfer it and i 'm make sure that you know, you have another container ready so, you can layer it up.
but this only takes a couple minutes you can go ahead and cook it on the stove.
just the meat, while you get everything else ready and it makes it a little bit faster and a little bit easier.
but still, if you have a game night or something going on you can prepare this a few minutes ahead of time.
get it in the crockpot, come back a couple hours later, or maybe, even just one hour later.
and dinner is completely ready.
so very easy to do.
i 'm going to finish cooking up this meet and i 'll show you how i assembly in the crockpot.
you could use hamburger by the way, sorry about all the, the steam you could use hamburger by the way, and, that is a cheaper alternative.
but i found this chop steak on sale and i use this in the husband approve steak sandwiches.
and i love it.
and i find it just a little bit better.
but you could definitely use just at ground round.
if you wish be sure to drain it though, so rather.
uhm , you 're cooking your meat on the stove or in the crockpot when it is done you will need to add one half.
can just a half a can of the enchilada sauce i 'm using mild?
and then, i added one can of the traditional refried beans mix that up.
you could do this totally in the crockpot and then transfer it to a bowl.
if you wanted not to have to cook so.
but you 're still going to have to mix in that, half a can of enchilada sauce and the refried beans and that is what you got.
let 's get to making our taco.
so in my crockpot, i have the other half of the mild enchilada sauce and you just put it on bottom, and i 'm going to put one software.
T it down i 'm just going to kind of spread it around make sure.
it 's got enchilada sauce under it.
and then we 're going to start building our taco stack you 're going to spread some of that meat mixture on that first taco.
stack , try to get it as even as you can.
and you 're going to have to, you know, work out of your bowl or skillet, which ever you 're using.
and then you 're going to add some cheese just like that and another tortilla, and you 're going to keep doing that until you 've used up all your meat.
and i usually like to try to at least get six of the tortillas in sometimes more.
so i 'm going to continue building this up.
and i 'll show you how i finish it.
OK , so i believe i have seven tortillas.
you can see there all stacked up.
so , let 's recap for a second.
we have half a can of the mild enchilada sauce at the bottom of the crockpot.
we started out stacking soft tortilla on top of that enchilada sauce.
we layered in our beef and onion mixture, which for me is beef cube steak with an onion we 've added.
the other half my own enchilada sauce, our refried beans, we stacked it up on soft tortillas with in the crockpot added cheese in between each layer and now, i 'm at the top.
so how i like to talk this is with the velveeta cheese sauce.
this is the case so it comes in these little packets.
so , and you 're just going to pour one or two over the top.
usually i put to my husband, loves this meal.
this is one of his favorite meals of all time and i just squeeze this out.
it 's kinda hard to do i 'm on camera with one hand.
but i just like to squeeze out an over the top and cover the entire top of the soft taco.
so you can see that it 's covered in the ooey, gooey delicious.
well , be de queso cheese, you could certainly make your own case, so you can make your own refried beans.
do what you wish you could shred your own cheese?
i 'm showing you a quick way to do this, but she could certainly add your own special touches.
so here it is, i have the babita cheese on top.
put my lid on and from this point done in basically either one hour on high, or even one hour on low, either which way it 's just going to melt those cheeses.
warm everything up.
but you could keep it on low and your family, you know, could enjoy it whenever you are back from a game or back from church or whatever on any kind of night?
it will be basically done in one hour.
but you can keep it on warm as long as you need too, and even on low, it will probably be done in close to one hour, maybe and a half hours to two hours.
but i like to put it on high when i 'm home and get all those flavors, mixed , together.
an warmed up together and after about one hour you could certainly serve this up and i will show you how i do that.
next so i just took my knife cut into it got a piece out.
an it is such a simple delicious meal.
it can stay on low in the crockpot for awhile.
and it will stay warm for your family, especially if you know, you have people running in and out.
this is such a delicious, easy meal to make, i 'm going to show you how i played it up next, so this is how we serve it up.
you can see the different layers.
i have a big dollop of whipped cream on top.
some salsa, an also a couple scoops, i just used my melon baller inside of avocado and that is our dinner, and i hope you guys enjoy this recipe.
i promise if you make it for your family, they will love it as much as my family does you can use ground.
you can use chicken.
you can use cube steak, whatever makes you happy, you could certainly do and again that you can start this off on the stove or you can start it off in the crockpot, which ever works for you.
