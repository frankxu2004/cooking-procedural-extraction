spring rolls can be filled with anything.
there is thrilled with char shu there.
chinese roast pork with shrimp with chicken vegetarian.
you ca n't find two recipes or spring rolls that are the same, so for today.
what i did was i made up a vegetarian spring roll.
so we have something vegetarian, and it 's basically a mushroom flavor.
and what 's in it is shredded napa.
this is napa.
also , i 'll say this one wrong tense in bok, choy has a thick white stock and then abroad, dark, green.
the thought is white.
choi is vegetable.
so this is napa cabbage.
sometimes also called shanton cabbage.
i have a lot of it 's a very, very light case, very crispy.
it 's very light and it 's used in a million things, including stir fry, does a vegetable.
so i have shredded up some of that.
i shredded up some carrots.
i prepared some mung bean.
these are shredded bamboo shoots, the preferred bamboo is called the winter bamboo shoot.
it 's a little tender.
also , they can, but there whole and it will say on the can, of course, it will not say it will say.
no , they change it.
OK strip have to look carefully, because there are also some slides and you could use those.
but then you have to kind of like this, i use these a lot, because they 're ready to go drain him.
squeeze out the water.
i recommend you blanch in boiling water from there to get that sort of.
can taste out and then using many recipes that kind of indestructible crunchy there a little bit crunchy, even after you can?
so here you can see the noodles.
it 's a bunch of threads and the key is.
there 's no liquid.
it has to be dry if it 's wet when you roll up the spring roll, which only showed you next it will tear.
it will rip it will break.
so it needs to be quite dry.
and do you, do, you do that i strangely, i do it by drug, you.
and you want to stir fry.
i have a two hundred thousand BTU outside.
burn as i do this for a living in the house.
i had to so like this and you can do it fine.
you can do fine in a frying pan, and this you can even do it in a non stick pan.
these as long as it says spring roll shell spring roll wrapper sometimes they 'll say lumpia, which i think is an indonesian, i think philippine not too far off and i did n't say texas i need here 's the thing they come in the top is about twenty five.
in the package, and they 're like all stuck together.
they come frozen and get him home quickly.
you leave it in the freezer, but i would rewrap them even to hold on to him.
and sometimes are very hard to separate, mean it 's easy to find the edge and sometimes, you 'll pull them apart.
the certifying, and they wo n't come apart easily.
like this, and trick is actually too cold sore to the middle and pulling into two and then they can keep dividing if you 're having a problem with them sticking 'cause they just sometimes they really stick.
now making spring rolls is really is rocket science.
it 's really hard and none of you will ever be able to do it.
however , only i can do this, so you take the spring roll wrapper and you can also get these smaller you can cut them and make them smaller.
you lay it down.
a little bit of diagonal you do n't have to, but this really seems to work the best to take.
if you put more filling, you 'll get a thicker role, not a big deal, so you can see the mushrooms in the noodles and so forth.
and then you bring this corner up, put it past and just pull it back a little bit.
but like rolling a cigarette.
so you pulling a little to get a little tighter come over, bring up the sides and actually when you do this, the trick is kind of do n't pull this hard over that and you want to make sure that it is n't going out at this angle.
so this one is going straight or slightly in if it 's out when you roll it up, it 'll be all wrong.
so you just bring it over it does n't have to be super neat OK can you roll it up pretty sort of tightening it as you go you, roll here and you bring your hand out as you roll a little bit not super type it pretty firm, and you take some glue in this case it 's blue in this case, the scrambled eggs if you are vegan, you could use a little library case flower water you just need to be really to seal the end and you roll it up and that 's it is your hard to make and they 're very delicate and you have to be extremely careful with these let me try again to show you put some in that 's not the same amount.
so it will be slightly different if you really want to get them all the same size, you put something down on your board that 's the length you want.
let 's say, i wanted to make them all this size i would put this down and then i would really though i do n't have enough filling, unroll it i put a little more and what you do in a while you get used to making them pretty uniform folded over you fold it over roll it up you put a little glue using a pastry brush that 's it then can we have the whole trailer what we want and these you could freeze right.
now wrong at that, freezing maybe great, make sure you rap them very airtight that oil is just about ready.
now that 's a lot in there.
but i give a text to bed and then fry them until they are just right, and that 's it.
now you sort of can hurt them really well, if you know, it was very cold, they would get soggy.
and then we would just take him out, and get the oil hot.
drop him in the oil would come out of them.
i do n't mean oil that got inside, but oil in the dough.
if you raise the temperature to give it up supposed to fry.
and three hundred three fifty.
but when you put them in, i put really put a few, too many in because otherwise it is, but i 've never achieved, i will tell you.
i do n't know the answers when you have screen roles in my personal opinion, the best thing in the world that you can put on them.
the best thing i 've ever had.
i tried plum sauce which is very gingery and sticky, one momento poor before well, that 's my backup.
is there anything in this world?
my ploy that strictly i said that i 'm saying this type product.
i keep saying chinese, chinese and now it 's very sweet.
it 's like it 's hot.
it 's hot and it 's garlic.
i do n't know where you get this brands that people learn by switching so they 're not quite done crying she wanted to help.
