hello , i 'm anthony boco for ehow today.
we 're going to make some lamb skewers with an orange and honey glaze with the lamb skewer today.
we 're going to be securing them with some red pepper, some chip alini onion, and again we 're going to have a nice glaze of orange honey.
we 're going to do is we 're going to make a nice simple.
glaze what i have here.
is i have just a simple acacia honey to that we 're going to add the juice of the orange?
they were going to toss it.
some in the goal here is to make it glaze.
so it actually layer perfectly over that lamb and give you a nice kind of sheen mission to enhancing the flavor without being over the top.
the pepper we 're going to basically do a nice little dice that fit in between those alternating slices of lamb and onion.
here we have our lamb in our, in our chip.
and again that will actually be positioned on the skewer, will dice are part lamb in a way that once we sear it will have a nice set up mid rare in the middle and then we just have some of our segments already from our oranges?
they were going to toss it submit and just kind of give us that nice kind of garnish for our plate.
all the labor comes in the assembly of the skewers, and we 're talking minimal.
we 're talking eight minutes to skewer six minutes to cook great dinner or appetizer in less than fifteen minutes.
