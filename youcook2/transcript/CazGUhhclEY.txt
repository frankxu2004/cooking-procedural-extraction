name is emily lobeck.
and i 'm going to teach you how to make a great blue cheese spread to put on top of hamburgers were grilling hamburgers tonight.
so all you need is walnuts and you need to shop those, you need some blue cheese.
some cream cheese, a little bit of cognac and some onions that we 're going to get in there.
so i 'm going to start by crushing these up with a rolling pin.
my dad taught me and that looks good right there, just so i 'm going to take this cream cheese in here, pet it in the wall.
it 's one whole package.
but i 'm going to stir that a little bit i 've started this up a little bit to make it a little softer to get it ready for the blue cheese and i 'm going to put a half a package of blue cheese in there, alright, that 's good and then you need to add your walnuts.
and it calls for a half a tablespoon of cognac, and i 'm just going to eyeball it.
find all right.
it 's not like walk it.
always kinda, like rocket fuel, yeah, it is pretty strong alright great about a teaspoon of onion into here going to put some cracked pepper and salt in here.
just a little bit to taste, this is kosher salt or using it, does n't matter what kind of saw it is really though, mix it up, and then we 'll have a taste test here soon.
alright that looks about good.
this is going to be so good on a burger.
i cannot wait for dinner.
this is kind of grilling one, oh, one.
but it 's one of the biggest mistakes.
i see grillers encounter is when they make a hamburger because it usually ends up shrinking up meatball instead of being a good hamburger.
so let me show you something first of all, the quality of the beef is very important.
this is from a local butcher.
while the product is local in it 's an eighty twenty lena, so there 's twenty percent.
fat , eighty percent meat you do n't want anything more lame than that because then it wo n't hold together when you 're grilling it.
and it wo n't have much flavor and since this is really good beef, i 'm gonna have a really nice blue cheese spread on it.
we 're just going to salt and pepper, these were not going to get fancy with any kind of rubber anything, so, anyway, you take the handful burger about the size of a baseball.
you do n't packet two type you want to still have a little looseness to it.
but you just flat out this.
it 's really important to, to let these come to room temperature, which will make some cook better if you 'll notice.
i 'm kind of hollowing out something in the middle or the area in the middle where it 's thinner than the outside portion of the burger and the reason is when you grill that it has a tendency to pull together.
so if you 've already made this thin, you 'll come out with an even burger instead of a big meatball.
so that 's just a little secret for how you do it.
then you just hit it with a little salt, little, salt, little pepper grill.
it try to turn it just two or three times want to get it medium meeting.
i like a medium rare.
but with ground, beef medium.
so tell you do the perfect burger will be back to show you what the blue cheese spread looks like race time to assemble the burger.
we 're going to put a thin layer of this spread on each done or what are these nets bennetts.
we talked about to give us some texture, and it 's just a little healthier than the big ones and then we sauteed up some mushrooms.
you put that on top of one of the banana.
it 's right take a look at this burger.
if you 'll notice it did not much up into a ball.
and , that was because of what we did.
which was create that hollow or thinner center kind of add some lettuce to this one.
and top it off.
it 's ready to go.
