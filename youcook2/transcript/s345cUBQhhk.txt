it 's easier for you because i do n't think you will remember all of this, so let 's start with the ingredients.
so here i have two pounds of beef soon.
then we have three onions.
i will need two onions inside of the garage and then another onion is for when you done.
and you put it on the dish so that 's decoration.

then we have one fourth of a cup of oil.
i olive oil half of the cup, i mean, half of the camp of the tomato paste, half of that.
and we have four garlic cloves that little crush.
i have here, bread crumbs.
i make my own bread crumbs.

it 's really easy and i just enjoy the taste.
so this is half of half a cup of bread crumbs.
then we will need caraway seeds.
two teaspoons of caraway seeds three teaspoons of paprika.
this is hungarian paprika.
it 's really good.
then we will need two tablespoons of salt blow bit of pepper, then we have margarine.
we wanted two teaspoons of larger amp, then one teaspoon of beef base if you do n't have, this be phase.
you can just skip it, it will still taste good them.
it 's OK, you do n't have to use it.
i just like the flavors.
and then we have eight cups of water, so, first we will chop this two ends an.
let 's start it.
cut this much of onion was a torture.
i had stuff coming out of my eyes.
my nose, wow.
that was crazy.
so we have here.
two big onions, i mean, two medium size onions cut small pieces that are among the flame and let 's put one fourth of oil inside.
and now we go bonna roast them little bit.
let 's keep it on high steer.
and i turned it off right.
now because we need to add some ingredients like paprika, aniff, paprika is added while the stove is hot, it will burn, and then it will become better.
so i turned it off.
and now i can add more stuff so let 's add who teaspoons of a curve.
i see it three teaspoons of paprika.
this is not easy because it 's so close off connect to be perfect for clothes of garlic.
i crushed it, so now we will need half of the can of a tomato paste.
the cystex answers.
so you will need three ounces, and i forgot to mention that the beginning at every time you use this tomato paste you have to use sugar.
because tomato paste is kind of sour.
so we have three teaspoons sugar, oh, great.
now this is what i 'm dealing with here is a sugar.
no , that 's OK, two three next time.
we have coffee in hotels like publica that 's OK how much turn.
it back on.
let 's mix it little bit, but you do n't wanna have it on high.
so put it on law because we do n't want to burn that public company just so i get mixed up.
schmela higher for very short time and now let 's add the meat.
there is two pounds beast you as fast steeler, little bit.
put it on loan now, will be adding salt and pepper, so two tablespoons of salt a little bit of pepper you like more, you can add more.
it 's spirit again like nicely mixed up together.
and now let 's add the water.
let 's put it on high.
we have eight cups of water and now we 're gonna wanna.
have it next stop an?
we , wanna wait till it starts to boil.
this means will take after it, boiling.
take about hour?
fifteen minutes or hour up to hour, forty five minutes.
it depends on the type of meat you have.
so , the garage is boiling.
let 's put it on a law.
and now let 's add if you have this beef base.
one teaspoon if you do n't have it, that 's OK, now let 's set up the timer for one hour.
after one hour.
we will be adding the bread crumbs and try house off the meat is so let it cook for one hour.
sometimes you come and steer it, you do n't have to stay here because there 's nothing that will really burn like bread.
crumbs woodburn so just come maybe every ten minutes and steer it a little bit and that 's it make sure that the glass is.
still , boiling i have it on number five, no six number six.
but i 'll put it on a five and out.
i crack it open.
so this team has a space to escape, it 's been now one hour since our garage is boiling.
so , let 's see, i try to meet an.
it 's actually halfway done.
it 's almost done.
so we will add now half a cup of bread crumbs.
this will thicken it up, which is really great addition in my clam up like this is what happened.
so just steer it pretty fast before it makes a bigger chunk.
let 's set it up for another fifteen minutes.
but now you have to steer it.
because this will burn on the bottom put the lid back on.
because this will be shooting.
now into the air.
most of goulash goodness.
you do n't wanna.
all over your stove, but every probably two minutes you 'll have to steal.
let 's cover it up.
lower it a little bit, it still has to boil, though, but not, too much, let 's also add two teaspoons of marjoram.
this is really tasty.
or so the collage took one hour forty five minutes if you want to have them it really soft, that 's how long it takes.
and you do n't have to steer it every two minutes.
every two minutes theory so hour and forty five minutes.
it looks tasty.
so here is our famous check beef goulash, and i made it with dumplings.
that 's the way that it supposed to be done.
if you are not brave enough and you do n't know how to make dumplings, or you do n't have a courage to do the dumplings just have it with the bread.
because that 's fine , too.
but you can check out my video.
how to make these dumplings an inch.
at we have this saying if you know, how to make these dumplings then you can get married.
that 's the thing and now my husband will try this favorite.
i have to comment first.
how correct christine is.
because i have literally proposed to her on multiple occasions due to this meal, and i do want to say that there is a scale that only applies to her cooking.
most people rate food on a one ten scale ten, being the best.
christina has a ridiculous scale that starts above ten, and this is at the top of the ridiculous scale.
this is, this is in fact, better then the garage.
now , this is better than the goulash that you get at the check restaurants.
amazing chrome nothing.
no , why eat anything else and then the freshly chopped unanswered grade edition truly tasty, oh, will you marry me?
yeah , she said, yes, that 's good.
matthew C so enjoy it.
so i 'm going to try the check ghoulish that casino rate for us which is, i 'm really excited about it i 'm from europe and i have n't had garage here in the states.
so i 'm really excited to try it, and the only girl she, she mama she makes cooler.
so this feels like home to me right now and i 'm just going to try it and then i 'm going to tell you what i think about it but it 's not.
already really, really, really good what i like is that the mean pieces that there are smaller.
so you do n't have to cut them.
so i had goulash as they had big johnson, and.
so this is perfect.
all right sadly good fairwood.
the , the beef is not julie or anything.
it 's really, really soft.
so this is what i would say is a really, really good european coalesced.
