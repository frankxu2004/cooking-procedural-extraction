today , i 'm going to be doing a different kind of tutorial for you.
i 'm going to show you how to make sushi, and one of my personal favourites is the california rolls.
so i 'll be showing you how to make that kind of a neat are some imitation crabmeat, avocado 's rights of course.
i 'm using calrose right seaweed, brace vinegar mayonnaise.
this is just a japanese.
me macy could use a regular american meaning, toasted sesame E seeds and water.
i 'm going to prep the rice, and i 'm going to mix in some rice vinegar into the race.
i 'm just going to put about this is about i do n't know.
two cups of rice, and i 'm going to fill this lid with two LED fulls of brace vinegar and the rice vinegar.
basically makes the rice sticky.
i guess some people like mixing the rice vinegar when your rice is hot, however, when you start rolling or at least in my experience i find that whenever make sushi with rice or warm rice.
the seaweed tends to break a lot easier or one more legible.
see the races now nice and sticky, now.
let 's go ahead and prep the from me.
i 'm going to put some mayonnaise in the crab meat and you 'd be surprised by how much mayonnaise.
people put in sushi sing a generous amount.
so , first i 'm going to show you a really easy way to make sushi, and this is n't going to be your typical inside out.
roll take the rice and lay it on top of the mat is important to spread the rice evenly, and you just want a thin layer of rice you do n't want to pack on too much or also role is going to be really, really big, and sometimes i, i mean, i do n't like it too big.
i 'm leaving about an inch or two space so you can, she lit.
and i 'm gonna.
take the crab meat an way a strip of their onto the bottom section of the role take your avocado and lay it on top right.
and then i like to sprinkle some sesame E, seeds.
people say eggs those little tiny eggs that you put in to see what your call seminal salmon topeka green salmon roe, what is it goes on?
japanese salmon roe, where they mixed with sabi and the japanese or them.
if that 's a little salmon roe eggs, hungry, what are the orange ones?
this is bigger.
seven room, OK, thank you.
so i do n't have that stuff and i do n't like it.
so i do n't put it in my role.
so , instead i put sesame E seeds gonna, teach the bottom and hate lee cup.
it , i 'm making sure it 's kate.
so you look like that, and then you 're going to continue rolling it.
so it looks like that, and then i 'm going to seal it with water kind of like april should be guys ever made aprils english yogurt and water and then i 'm going to continue to roll there.
you go there is my sushi roll.
but this time i 'm not going to leave any gaps of the top.
they have my race on the CV, and i 'm going to put it over to the other side, so, OK, my dear, i 'll show you how you can put sesame E seed on this is.
you just sprinkle it on this is a trick that i learned, i think i was watching anthony bordain when he went to japan.
cut right down the middle and make sure your nice is wet.
so that way you do n't ruin this sushi cut right down the middle and then put them side by side.
your second name, cool, oh, no.
this end is kind of ugly, so i 'm not gonna ask start it for watching.
