today , we 're going to talk about one half.
this is the big, big liver of fat dick.
we 're going to divide those logs and into two, if you 're not enough people, if you 're less than six four people, then just by the slice is already made.
and that 's it going to your house, if this is for four.
we 're using we 're using hot water and this sliver of should get out of the refrigerator ten fifteen minutes before you slice.
and it is very generous with assault becaus.
there is more fat than protein in the liver so it does n't take a lot of the solid, so it 's important to be over generous.
soldier , so literally thirty seconds on one side, thirty seconds only are they have a very hot pan dry on the very hot fire.
and that 's it.
you see how easy it is.
and then you 're cooking, it just and.
so it 's just stuff, and if you like you can based it a little bit, two quick IDS to garnish a program which is perfectly fine as it is.
