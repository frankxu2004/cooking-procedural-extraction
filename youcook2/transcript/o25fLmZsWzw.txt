and we have grass fed beef you wanted only the best quality animal protein not feed lot, beef grass fed no hormones, antibiotics, pesticides got more.
omega three pass more antioxidants better for you and taste better than more expensive.
but worth it olive oil extra virgin, olive oil only by the best becaus it 's full of poly, phenols, antioxidants it actually protects against heart disease and.

so here we go we 're going to start and by the way, you know, i get a lot of my staples at a place called thrive market, which is a fantastic online market.
it 's a discount market where you can get all the best quality whole.
fresh real foods for twenty five to fifty percent.
off the retail price ship it directly to your door.
so i get all my staples, nuts, seeds, spices, salt, pepper and all the ingredients, i used for cooking really come from there, and it 's great.
i heard you check it out, so let 's get started with heat up the pan and going to start with olive oil turns out.
i do n't even worry about measuring too much.
i usually, you know, this time of my ballpark a coat, the pan, a little bit a couple of tablespoons or.
so by olive oil and you do n't want to eat all about too hot.
because it can go bad.
it can actually go rancid and get damaged.
you want to eat it up gently and not super and throwing the garlic and onions, and let it cook out for a bit.
and then we put in the B from the spice is delicious.
and amazing your cooking is one of those essential simple tasks that we have to learn how to do it, we do n't know how to cook.
we can feed our bodies with so simple, so essentially.
you want it 's fun, you get to play with your food.
i love to play with my food, and you get to smell.
he 's awesome, smells garlic onions and olive oils on my favourites smells.
so once the onions and garlic cook down a little bit, you grab the ground, beef and grass head of course, and you just kind of put it in here and then switch it up.
make sure it 's also much tough.
sometimes you can use your hands as soon as my hands when i cook to play with my food is kind of fun.
you do n't want to be look at these pressure on need.
so it 's not a good idea in trouble for that.
but i just want to check it all up in a nice little chunks and do n't burn yourself click down and put the spices in to all the spice that pre.
we 've got cumin coriander and chili altogether.
and then we speak about all, in here.
so we 're just letting the beef tacos cook up a little bit and then we 're going to make waka, moly now.
i wash my hands in between, and i watch the ball.
so , do n't worry?
we are going to make guacamole now, people in guacamole is so hard how long to make moly, but it 's actually pretty easy.
and that 's it.
and here 's my secret way of cutting the avocado.
you do n't cut your hands, and then you take the pit, and you can just knock it with this little trick, pops right out and have to make a mess.
and then you basically asleep out the guacamole avocado into a bowl.
kuala so even the script right out and put on that well i have to make a couple of avocado 's worth.
an avocado just full of powerful any, any disease compounds that are.
so delicious and.
so rich and.
so creamy, and you can use it in all sorts of things you can use it in smoothies, you can use in soups you can make ice cream out of it, it 's awesome food.
actually , for the condom it right, so we have a little bit of lines here for afterwards, so we can sprinkle amanar taco and then.
we want to take some line and actually put it in the, in the quokka, moly.
and i have my favorite little hand tool he believes all these fancy machine but this is a simple squeezer for lemons or limes i love it when you squeeze it all in there and choose another one and got two lime juice is in there and a super evening a little bit of salt a little bit of pepper.
and , well, i got my kamali and then use.
push it very simple in your pork you can get a potato.
masher , but it 's pretty easy.
you just sort of chop it up much it out.
and it takes a minute and it 's all while the tacos cooking, so you kind of maximize your time.
and you have everything ready when the tacos are done in about three minutes.
we 're going to have a taco so it 's quick.
it 's simple, does n't take a long time.
and it actually is so delicious and so good for you.
and you get all the good quality fats from the olive oil from the guacamole and from the grass fed beef, which interesting, has far more omega three fats, then, then imagine 'cause they eat grass and that 's where actually wild animals get all their omega, threes is from eating wild plants and feed lot.
beef has no mega truth and feed lot.
beef has way more mega sixes, which are inflammatory romantic, so here you go you got your waka, moly.
so easy guacamole, and then actually spread it on the, on the leaves, and the way we make the tacos is we do n't use flour tacos or corn tacos.
we want to reduce our grains as part of the fact that bin program we just take a little bit, i mean, sort of spread it on here like a basic sort of creamy filling for the taco on the lettuce, wraps i like to lie.
but you do n't have to do.
and , you know, we pretty much have our tacos done.
it 's so simple.
and we 're going to take the beef, which is done, ground, beef and put it in here.
oh , it 's yummy stuff.
and here we go.
and then we just put a little bit of the ground, beef inside the taco, so here we go and look good.
in here, you think it 's a lot of talk about this with your whole family.
and you can kind of rap it up at the end.
and , you get to just use it like a, like a taco when we take a little cilantro.
we put on slide show, you tomatoes, the tomatoes and, uh, easy goes to cook it 's not that hard, even a doctor can do it imagine that and, and then you take a little line and spritz, it on that 's it and line, and well, i you guys could tacos dinner how easy is that and everybody 's happy your family your kids happy they love it, it 's delicious and it 's easy to make in is good for you.
