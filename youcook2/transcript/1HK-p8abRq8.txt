today , i am representing team pancakes, i always remembered the buckwheat pancakes my gramma made growing up and it just brought back a lot of memories.
so i wanted to try and recreate those what makes these pancakes really like.
big and fluffy is there 's more baking hotter than normal recipes as far as like getting more heights to it, too it 's a thicker batter.
so what i 'd like to do is kind of plop it down and then kind of swirl it on top.
so you have like this big ball, and it slowly sags down with the outside.
cook it just starts rising more so it 's cubic cottage cheese.
sarrah , cha sliced up ham and now, if it 's a passion fruit, maple syrup skip program.
