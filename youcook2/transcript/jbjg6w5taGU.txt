hey , everybody today i 'm going to show you how to make some old-fashioned buttermilk fried chicken, oh, yeah, baby.
so what you wanna do is get your favorite chick in pieces that you enjoy the best anne wash them real clean.
drive them off with a paper towel and put them in a bowl and covered them with salt and pepper on both sides, salt and pepper to your taste.
and , sad that buttermilk we 're going to squirt a some franks red hot sauce, you could use whatever hot sauce you wo n't start up real nicely.
an in marinated in the refrigerator for at least three hours now onto our flower i want to get three cups of all purpose flour, one tablespoon of salt.
one tablespoon of black pepper freshly ground an one tablespoon of garlic powder.
now start up real good with your fork.
once you get all that in there and make sure you mix it very, very well, and once you get it mixed really, really, really, well, once you take your pieces out of the fridge and do n't knock all the buttermilk off of him that 's what makes some crispy and then do like this, cover them completely with your flour mixture shake off any excess and kind of lay it aside, there OK.
now we 're going to come in with one of our pieces and do exactly the same thing very simple, just wanna make sure you get all the nooks and crannies covered with your flour mixture, just like.
so kind of sticking with this little bit show, he has done, oh, yeah, baby, and then i kind of like to let that set a little while for my pans getting up to heat, you know, i 'm saying.
so that 's peanut oil there, and i 'm filling it up enough to where it will not splash over onto the heat and start a fire yet to be real careful when you are frying now.
this is a walk.
i use a walk that 's my favorite utensil words that chicken looks like after it sit for awhile, how to start get little dryness in few areas and once your greece gets up to three hundred and fifty degrees gets you the monitor out and check it, you wanna, make darn.
sure it 's good in hot.
if it 's not your old chicken, just wo n't look good.
no , i 'm saying right now, we 're going to drop our chicken into our very hot grease very carefully.
and i wo n't put every bit of it in there at one time right now.
i , i only cook for two people and we do a lot of wings, but you can might have to do two batches OK.
and i 'm a firm believer that once you put your chicken in you do n't mess with it.
you do n't mess, with and towel and start till it starts getting a little bit brown.
and then all you do is do what i 'm doing there just kind of real, gently flip them over, you know, i 'm saying so, do n't knock off all the goodies?
oh , yeah, baby, and then all of a sudden they start get, beautifully.
and that 's kind of your thermometer when they get to be that golden brown right there, folks after about twenty, twenty five minutes of fried and babies are done, you, wanna me.
now like mine really crispy, and you may not want yours, is krispy?
so you decide there 's what mine looked like and maybe a pretty little plate there with some green beans.
corn , the cobb bush good, really crispy, and delicious, we all i hope you give this a try and i hope you subscribe and hope you tell all your friends and i hope you make it a really nice day.
