hi , welcome to lens recipes today.
i want to show you my version of chicken parmesan.
this is a pretty easy recipe that does n't take very long to make, and it makes a really good dinner to make this chicken parmesan.
these are the ingredients that you 're going to need.
you 're going to need some thin cut chicken breast, and it must or it 's labeled chicken cutlets, and you can use as many as you need for the amount of people you 're going to feed, you 're also going to need some all purpose flour, an i have put some salt and ground pepper in this in mixed it up you 'll need some beaten eggs mixed with a little bit of water, and i just wish that together you 'll need italian bread crumbs you 'll need about forty eight ounces of tomato sauce, and you can make your own tomato sauce or use qard, it does n't matter, you 'll need about six ounces of mozzarella cheese and you 'll need some freshly grated parmesan cheese also we 're going to serve ours with spaghetti, and i 'm just going to cook that according to the package directions to get started making this parmesan chick in the first thing we 're going to do is we 're going to dredge the chicken in the flour, the egg in the italian bread crumbs.
so let me show you how to do that.
it 's pretty easy.
you just make sure that each side of the chick in gets a little bit of the flower on it, shake it off a little bit move over to the egg.
both sides we 're going to move over to the bread crumbs and make sure that it 's very well coded.
both sides, and then i 'll just set it aside on a dish, so i 'm going to finish doing this chick in.
and so when we get done with the last piece we 're going to take it over to the stove and we 've got a skillet that 's going to have olive oil.
in it we 're going to heat it up.
and we 're going to brown both sides of this chicken.
OK , so i put a little bit of the breading in to make sure the olive oil was hot, enough and so now.
what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to add my chick in to the olive oil in brown, it scoot around to make room for all of it.
that 's the last piece, so we 're going to let it brown.
and then i 'm going to turn it over, and brown, the other side.
but i think it is nicely browned on both sides.
and then we 're going to go back over to the counter and continue with the recipes.
OK , so now i 'm going to assemble the dish.
the first thing i 'm going to do is i have a nine by thirteen inch festival dish that i sprayed and i 'm going to put some of my sauce in the bottom of it, and.
now i 'm simply just going to lay my chicken on top of the sauce.
OK , so now what i 'm going to do.
is put a little bit more sauce on top of the chick in and i am going to use the rest of the sauce i 'm going to put in a sauce pan and i 'm going to heat it up and we 're going to serve it over pasta later.
on , so then what we do is we take our mozzarella cheese and you would just lay it on top.
then i 'm going to sprinkle my parmesan on top of that can use as much of this as you want.
it 's up to your taste, and then i think i 'm going to just drizzle a little bit of olive oil on top of the cheese is OK now.
i 'm going to do.
is put this in a three hundred and fifty degree preheated oven for about thirty minutes my chicken parmesan is done it cook for about thirty minutes and this is what it looks like nice and golden on the top so now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to get my spaghetti and i 'm going to put it all in a serving.
plate , and then i 'll come back and show you what it looks like this is my version of chicken parmesan.
i hope you enjoy it.
