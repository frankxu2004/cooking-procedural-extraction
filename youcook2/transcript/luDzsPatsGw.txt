his dim really excited.
because we 're going to do a phogoth which is a very traditional french speciality from the southwest part of france that the people from the southwest part of france they eat it regularly as part of their, their regular meals.
but the rest of the people in france in the rest of the world needed a very special occasions and.
so we 've made one today for christmas and new years.
we 're going to know.
we have here in nine hundred graham swap liver, which normally there about six hundred sars is quite big, and we 're going to do is we 're going to prepare the flaw, and we 're going to put in the telling and then we 're going to put in the oven for a hundred at a hundred and forty degrees celsius for an hour and a half.
so there 's actually two loops to the walk, the liver and what you need to do is we need to open it in between the two lobes.
so you cut in between the two lobes open it up.
and you need to devein it.
and you need to take out the part that is reddish my mother, not helping me.
i 've never done this before, so you actually have to just sort of pull the veins.
L do n't cut them out like there.
we go and just sort of there.
we go right.
that 's red to sort of scrape over to clean it out afternoon for a chair that sensing baby me.
so we 're opening it up to try to get this one vein out here or just.
sort of typically do on with you.
let 's do it with your hands and sort of just invented like with shrimp actually, and you just trying to take out this vein where it is and do it with your hands 'cause you do n't want to cut into the organ and just pull it out there you go shit close it back, up perfect.
so we 're just going to clean up a little bit, little bit like surgery and we 're getting all the red off.
so you use a paper towel and go over it keep trying it over.
so that it clean.
so we have here about twenty one grams of gold, said, which is saxy salt ground pepper.
ann kept cat spices.
the flies now deveined and what you do.
if you put your twenty, one grams of salt pepper and kept list S on plates so that you can marinate the false deliver there we go OK.
and so you just do a little back and forth here.
what 's going to make it really good and what changes, i suppose.
i would imagine what a different recipes of phogoth because the river itself, of course, take a normal and then expiration.
this is my first time.
we 've never done it before anything is possible.
make sure you get the spaces all over little bit like marinating a steak.
same basic principle said no wish to sire shops just as a warning that metal sala maybe a speedo, munko now right thank god almighty squishy, manabi OK.
then take the rest of your salt and pepper sprinkle it on.
it 's a little bit messy and so now we let that sit for six hours and we 're going to come back into the rest of it.
so it 's been six hours this has been cooling off in the fridge.
we 've already prepared it.
and so what we 've done is, we 've taken.
this is what they call in friends and family.
and we 're going to do is we 're going to put water in it and put it in the oven at one hundred and forty degrees until it starts to frizzled itself, which is the little baby bubble.
i 've gone ahead and warm the water a little bit, so that we can go a little bit faster.
i know, and then i 'm going to go ahead and put this in the oven to warm up.
what 's your coding.
no , and what we 're going to do with the final step is to take cognac will have an moniac in konyak here.
and my father in law said that probably cognac would be the best.
so we 're going to do is we 're going to take two tablespoons of konyak, and we 're just going to drizzle it on top.
so here we go with one drizzle on top and around the edges sort of they did on top and two.
this makes the fall out even more french because cognac of course is french there.
we go from the region of cognac, which is nearing full doof.
now the full is at a hundred and forty degrees, constant and.
so we 've got the bentley, which is the water who, and what we 're going to do is pull this out just a little bit who want to do is place the fall.
but we recently put into italian into the benelli and the water needs to go fifty percent up the town lane are closed into the middle of the fool.
they 're going to leave it in there an hour and a half, they had little ding, ding now then take it out.
i 'm going to take out just the telling so that we do n't, how are honest want to burn yourself?
the more difficult to do it.
let 's see, here.
maybe i 'll just take this big black thing out to do so no and let 's see, what it looks like wood.
forget it, and all that liquid, there is going to freeze up and that 's what becomes the yellow fat, the yellow fat all around the flag off.
we did it.
let it cool for one hour.
and then put it in the refrigerator for at least twenty.
four hours before you eat it playing so now it 's the next day.
we 're going to see what it looks like hello.
the fargo all finished.
