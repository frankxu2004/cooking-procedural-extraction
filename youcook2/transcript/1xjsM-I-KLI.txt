there 's nothing like a bowl of hot soup to warm your soul.
hi , i 'm karen hamidan.
welcome to another episode of cravings log today, we 're making my all time favourites soup hot and sour let 's start with the stuff.
we 're going to need two liters of stop now.
this can be your homemade stocks.
you can get it out of a can or package, or you can use these little stock cubes.
i 'm going to use the stock cubes today, and i 've used two cubes for leader.
i 'm going to bring this to a boil now if you 're feeling a little bit guilty because you have n't made your own homemade stuff.
do n't worry just take all of the leftover bits and pieces from all the vegetables that you cut and just throw it in the stock summer?
let 's talk about all of the ingredients in the soup.
we have so many ingredients and each one adds to the layers of complexity of flavors in this soup, i 'm going to start with minced ginger and garlic.
i finally minced, this is fine as i could, and i know you 're looking at me and saying what 's the alternative.
there is none suck it up, cut up some fresh ginger and garlic.
you can substitute the bursts of flavor that you 're going to get into the soup, do n't use bottle?
ginger and garlic.
it 's not going to work next.
i 'm also chopped up some talked about twelve bulbs and, and then i 'm going to saute some ground chicken.
i 've got about half a pound of ground chicken and the ground chick.
in is just going to soak up all the flavors like a sponge.
next i 'm going to add about five tablespoons of ground chili sauce or sam below lake.
now while this might seem a lot.
remember , we 're using two liters of liquid so the five chilly spoons are chili.
sauce is n't going to be too spicy at all, and i 'm also going to add a tablespoon.
john pepper, i 've also got half a cup of fresh mushrooms and chopped it up really fine.
i 'm going to give it a quick saute.
then we 're going to add the stock that 's been simmering back into the pot, and i 'm going to follow it with some canned shit talky, or you could even use the dried version.
just soak it up in some hot water cut it up and add it to the flavor.
these mushrooms, given amazing flavor to the soup, i 'm going to follow back with my secret ingredient, which is chopped up coriander, stems if the stems.
now while you 're thinking she 's using stems.
most people just throw these terms away.
but they have got a ridiculous amount of flavor in them now.
chop them up just like you would chop up chives or anyone of those herbs and chop it up.
really , fine, and add it into your soup.
once all that 's in i 'm going to add in some julian of carrots, bamboo shoots and some form to food that i cut up.
and , i 'm going to flavor it with some dark, so you sauce rice wine, vinegar, and i 'm going to thicken it up just a little bit.
i 've got a slurry of cornstarch just about two tablespoons cornstarch.
i do n't want the soup to be really gloopy.
you see, sometimes in restaurants when you have the soup overnight in your fridge, and you look at it.
the next morning just looks like a big lump of group.
i do n't want that in some egg.
and i 'm just going to use the fork and stored around just.
so you get this beautiful little egg ribbon and finally at the end were just going to add in some fresh coriander leaves that have been chopped up and some spring onion leaves that have reserved and we 're just going to add that in at the end as a garnish.
so let 's get started.
let 's out a four tablespoons of minced ginger and garlic in a couple of tablespoons of oil , next.
let 's add some spring onions.
i have about twelve balls, and i 've only chopped up the white parts.
i 'm going to add half a pound of ground chick in just break it up with the back of your spoon and squished down.
so there 's no lumps.
once the chicken is cooked, we 're ready to add the heart in hot and sour soup.
five tablespoons of ground chili paste or sambal, olik, now like i mentioned before this chick in is going to soak up all the flavors just like a sponge.
we 're also going to add a tablespoon of black ground pepper, add half a cup of fresh mushrooms and give it a quick saute.
and we 're ready to add the rest of the stock.
i 've got two liters of stock that 's been boiling away.
i 'm ready to strain that right into the mixture.
and once that 's done, i 'm going to take all the additional vegetables and discard them give the soup a really, really good stir.
and after that 's done we 're just going to bring this to a boil.
once this comes to a boil, let 's add about three hundred M L of ken, she talking mushrooms.
and then my secret ingredient coriander stocks i 've got two tablespoons of finely chopped coriander, stalks, this adds an amazing flavor at one carat that scott and julie and four tablespoons of canned bamboo shoots it 's also cut and julian, and finally some tofu that 's cut and julian as well, give this a good store.
then add in three tablespoons of rice wine, vinegar and three tablespoons of dark soya sauce.
next we 're going to add a simple cornstarch slurry to thicken the soup.
two tablespoons of cornstarch just mixed in with some water.
added right into the soup, and finally garnish with a quarter cup, each of chopped coriander and chopped spring onion lead in no brakes when you 're living in the fast way.
the hot and sour is ready.
i wish you could smell it, it smells absolutely delicious.
and it 's got layer upon layer and pawn layer of delicious flavors now.
if you want to make a vegetarian version of this dish, all you need to do is use vegetable stock instead and do n't use any egg or chicken, and you can achieve the same kind of flavor.
