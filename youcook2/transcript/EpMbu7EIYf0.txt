today welcome to the simple cooking channel.
today , i 'm going to be cooking my recipe of scrambled eggs, so we 're going to need is for eggs.
fifty grams of cheese grated pinch of salt and about roughly twenty grams of garlic, and half a cup of milk why use light milk.
you can use full cream if that 's what you use.
so those the ingredients for my scrambled eggs recipe now let 's get started making this thing you want to do is.
you want to turn the gas, or if you 've got an electric stove on to high now.
most people their eggs.
and they put them in a mixing bowl and with milk and stuff, and they mix it all together.
and i do it that way.
i just do it this way just straight in, straight in like that, and then turn it down to low.
at the milk not too much add the garlic and now had the cheese.
so i had all the ingredients at once.
therefore , everything will cook, and blamed at the same time, so there.
we go just a little bit left this little bit salt, just a pinch there we have our scrambled eggs and just chocolate altogether.
mix like this, you know, the little bit of cheese, little bit of garlic just give it just a little bit of a kick rather than often people just get scrambled eggs and mix it together with some milk.
pull it in, and that 's it.
just an extra two or three little bits of ingredients can go along way as you can see it 's already starting to thicken.
but as you can see when you look at it, it 's very evens very smooth.
it 's going to come out really nice texture and keep it on high and constantly, constantly.
mix it in, with this, constantly, mix.
it do n't leave it mistake that a lot of people make when they 're cooking with its eggs, or just regular meals.
is they go away and leave it?
come back to get as developed across it 's burned from the underside or trip that i 've learned is keep it moving constantly, constantly, moving.
now this is where we just leave it for a second leaving for about thirty seconds.
mix again, so basically what you want is the excess milk here.
bennett have a bit too much than not enough is there will be some excess milk that you put a little bit too much in which is.
what i like to do.
and then you let that evaporate slowly that way, it slowly cooks the eggs.
so rather than rushing and often people make eggs do n't have many ingredients in them.
and you hear people saying they 're always dry or this flavorless, will do it this way?
just spend an extra few minutes.
certainly wo n't be dry.
and they will not be flavorless, but these are pretty much ready now little bit of milk of the excess milk, but that 's almost funny.
you do n't want to cook it until all of that.
because , then what 's happening, is it 's no longer evaporating?
it 's i 'm just suck the moisture out of E X, and there.
you go simple.
different egg recipe scrambled eggs different way and all that was, was four eggs and that 's enough if you 're having toast that 's easily not for two or three people.
if you having eggs just by yourself, like i 'm going through this is probably more than enough.
for me very.
simple , very tasty, bursting with flavor absolutely , bursting.
the flavor so join me next time for my next meal.
