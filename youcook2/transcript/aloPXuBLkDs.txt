hi , i 'm jamie miller.
and today i 'm making tabbouleh a delicious and healthy summer salad featuring fresh parsley to bully features a lot of parsley, so you 're chopping a big mound.
it really helps, if you kind of gather it all together and just trap away until it 's nice and fine.
another main ingredient in tabouli salad, is bulgur wheat?
it 's a terrific option for summer salads because it does n't even require cooking.
all we need to do is pour enough boiling water over the bulgur wheat to cover.
and then let it set for about fifteen minutes.
so i 'll just set my bulger aside an next step is to make a refreshing little vinaigrette with olive oil and fresh lemon juice.
so we 've got about two lemons worth of fresh juice.
and you want to use a good quality extra virgin olive oil, and we just whisk that together for a simple and fresh tasting vinaigrette.
so i 've drained my bulgur wheat, and you want to make sure to press out as much water as possible next.
we 're going to go ahead and whisk in that vinegar at not the grains to really soak up all the flavor in that lemon juice and the olive oil before we start adding more ingredients.
so now i 'm going to stir in our freshly chopped up fragrant parsley.
i 'm also going to add to that lots of healthy vegetables.
i 've got some crisp cucumbers.
i have got some juicy ripe summer tomatoes, a little bit of red onion.
it 's going to add a nice save arena steward, ish, and some chopped up fresh mint.
we 're just going to stir all that together at a little bit of salt and pepper to taste, and you 've got a fantastic summer salad.
you can keep bonnie herbs like parsley and mint at your fingertips, right.
outside your kitchen by growing them in pots.
plant your bonnie herbs in a container filled with good quality potting soil, and where it gets good son to plant remove the label.
gently tear away the bottom of the pot and peel back the rim of the pot so it 's not sticking above the soil and planted.
