my husband has a potluck tomorrow.
and i made this italian pasta salad.
and it 's really easy.
and it 's one you can do the night before he just sprung it on me.
i 've cooked ouf a pound in a half of the rotini, and i 've cut up some vegetables.
this is one of those english cucumbers, half of an orange bell pepper yellow bell pepper.
i just had him in the fridge.
no point of the grape tomatoes over here.
i have some asparagus couple little handfuls of the snow peas, couple handfuls of green beans that i blanched and put in ice water bath show.
you how i did that.
i 'm blanching some vegetables and some boiling water.
just for like a minute or so, then, i place them in an ice water bath to cool down and to set the color look at how vibrant the colors are.
i 've already done some green beans, asparagus, and some snow peas, the snow peas.
i only put in for maybe like ten seconds.
anyway , i 'm going to finish up this broccoli and get back to making this salad.
i have some artichoke hearts a little bit of pimientos that are leftover from making pimento cheese i 'm going to put another little jar in, there, too.
just a little bit of red onion not too much a can of black olives the small ones strained just a little bit of broccoli.
i blanched it, and a couple small zucchinis that i blanched.
i have eight ounces of salami eight ounces of pepperoni, sliced and eight ounces of mozzarella cheese.
i 'm going to get this in my bowl.
i got the salad pretty well mixed, and you can use whatever vegetables you have.
that 's the beauty of this.
i 'm going to add three and three fourths ounce of salad toppings.
and then i 'm going to add sixteen ounces of an italian dressing.
i 'm going to add the whole bottle.
how many add this and then get it mixed again.
beauty of this salad is, you can make it the day before like, if you have a potluck.
we have a picnic.
you 're going to or something like that barbecue, and you can use whatever vegetables are in season, whatever you have in the fridge.
it 's really one that a lot of people like and it just gets better as it sits, needs a little salt and pepper other than that, it 's pretty good.
so that 's my version of an italian pasta salad.
