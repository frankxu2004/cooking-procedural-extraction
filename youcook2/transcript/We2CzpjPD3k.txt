ah , there 's a place in your house where it 's called to chill, get some me time or even cook a meal is the kitchen mofo angle time to slack to just grab yourself a penny, and this work that asked if you scared of this place and i 'll need to bother just lay down their weapons and pick up another.
hi guys, how 's it going.
welcome to my virgin kitchen.
today , i 'm going to show you how to make a classic british dinner is called bangers and mash, you might have heard of it.
but it 's basically mashed potato with sausages.
and it 's called failures because when you come in japan that 's the sort of noise.
it used to make cooking really fast right, so just call it sausage and mash.
if you get confused, but however they really cool gravy is really cheap really, feeling really yummy, so perfect for students.
all people animals whatever you want to be, and i love it, it 's a little chloe.
she told me how to make your speech is about to go to bed.
once you go to sleep.
i 'm going to come back to the kitchen.
i share to make this thing right hidden folks let 's get on an make.
this recipe is going to be so, so easy, even a monkey could do it.
i do n't think about that.
but i monkey probably could do it.
anyhow you just going to need three pans, and will get to them as.
and , when one of them has got pound of boiling water in it and we 're going to put potatoes in there.
so i 'm going to mash my potatoes have rustic feel to it, give me a wash and leave the skin on.
alternatively , peel it, if you do n't want to skin in there.
just going to boredom up mash up with some other special ingredient in effect.
we 've got a frying pan there, which is going to use for sausages, which were going to cook first of all, the old classic banger method you could put it in the oven under the grill if you want any way you want this problem OK.
so you can see my pan is nice and hot there.
the good thing about this recipe is you can really go to town on it, you can make it bland or as amazing as you want you basically just have protectors matched with sausages, or you can really twist the flavors on the head, which is what we are hopefully going to make it taste real good for you.
so that part is what i 've got my sausage here.
so i 'm just going to drop on in.
so , just so you get the idea.
i 'm going to come there.
nice and gone brown.
although around on the site and while they 're cooking we can work on our gravy and potatoes i 've gotta put more sausages in otherwise it 'll only sausage right there.
yeah , OK, amazing.
so all the sausage in the pan literally only just dropped in there.
they sort of put in their suntan lotion on ready to go into the sun there ready, and i hope you are too.
i do n't know what i meant by that but let 's just go along with it.
anyhow you saw that kind of water is boiling up for three out of the four months is in this truck.
the other one in there like that, so, the temperature does go down a little bit you notice, though that the water level was actually quite low.
because when you put the potatoes in it goes like a fat person.
get in the swimming pool, so we 're going to do is bring that up to the boil.
get almost cooked through.
should take about fifteen minutes they match away?
let 's move onto our gravy this stand on their own, their own going to keeping quite bland.
OK , you guys are right behind me.
what the part that sausage cooking away the potatoes bubbling away two and there 's one other pan here which i 've just started to warm up we 're going to add some oil in there going to add onions an AR leaks to start to build our gravy OK it 's going to be nice.
you 're going to love it.
OK , so close up on that power now.
it 's nice and warm, so just going to court in just under a tablespoon of oil, an right here.
i have got myself a chopped onion and chopped leeks.
so i 'm just going to push them in gradually i 'm probably never going to get it everywhere in class, not say that i 'm not really, really messy get everywhere.
but so far.
so good, that is, all in there.
so cook it away right away.
get it 's often and more stuff will add square fluid stuff fantastic so the leaks and onions all in there you can see there starting to soften, already.
we want i 'm so soft baby.
so , so, so, oh, yeah, OK.
let 's show you where we are.
so the leaks in the onions as we know, are breaking down going to come and add a little bit of busters in just a minute.
but it would just robot dance, right that you can see the sausages.
i 've been turning a man there on a very low heat wave to mention that just so we can time it.
we can always crank it up if we need too.
so we want to try and finish it all together.
OK , we 're just move up a little bit for throwing, you can see that it is over there still cooking away working, well.
so we 'll come back to onions and leeks now, and i will let go this report.
OK , steven annoys are talking about listen to this baby.
can you hear that?
yeah , that 's bangus.
so we had a little bit of fun and games to the leaks and onions otherwise fun games, but is fighting games.
so there nice and softer loving it just so floppy there like this.
so what we 're going to do is add in annaba butter for showing street in like that, and that will melt in and what i mean, just jumped out OK do n't worry about it.
that does n't have to happen for you, but anyhow let the heat sore meltdown spirit or through and one other tricky thing.
i 'm going to add if i 've got a little bit of golden syrup AK corn syrup in other countries.
just add a little squid in of that in there.
really naughty, cheeky, spanky kick start fruit okie, doke.
there 's only been two minutes.
you can see that fat is bubbling away in there is full of flavor.
there 's like a sugary, easiness as well, from that little bit of golden serve absolutely love.
and it 's going to taste so good.
so grab yourself five hundred mils of water and just pour that in like.
so what we 're going to do is add a stock you been with this.
now as well and also, a cheeky little ingredient you 're focusing before we send it down upgrading to two other things, one of them is a stock which is in my hands right.
now is going to take that in like that will have that.
so much faster.
but it 's all good stir that through before we bring one other thing.
remember , this is completely optional.
i 'm going to add some marmite OK about it before it gives you a cheeky little kick.
you can also do soy sauce or worse.
the source or some balsamic vinegar lots of different things you can add.
let 's just try some marmite today.
and i think you 're going to love it.
and it will spoonful of that in there.
OK , so i 've got my mom.
right there is just over a teaspoon is going to push that straight in there like that.
i think in australia you call that guys a vegemite, marmite i do n't know.
but anyway start through simmer, it.
and it should start thinking now baby right here.
my friends, it 's been five minutes.
the gravy simmering away.
it is hot in here, but it 's cold.
outside , so that 's a good thing right check out.
the gravy look will give a little stir you can see the onions and the leaks rise into the.
talk , that is, the texture i 'm after i want it, not too thick not too thin, if you want ticker maybe add less war.
maybe some flower.
it 's up to you.
that 's it right now, though, is a little bit of seed, you can use fresh sage news.
if you, like i 'm just going to pull this industry out the tub.
give it little still around give it a nice little funky boost wash.
and that goes out that i saw caesar, cooking away that thing.
cook him like that.
i can just keep turning, i 'm getting really nice and dark and funky.
but it 's kinda slow cooker approach.
the potatoes are just sliced in half that already have checked him sorry running a mushroom and we can bring this together, top right hope.
you can probably see here by giant salad bowl, and i 've put architectures in it, you can see as well, the skin just wants to pull off about this.
so we match up for that skin is going to breakdown.
let 's make some funky mash.
OK , so using the heater is going to check in a block of butter.
but so pour in a hundred mils of single cream he can use milk.
a heaped teaspoon of whole grain mustard chuck showing in that goes and just another teaspoon of sage in there so just sprinkle that in.
and then we get a match.
there , we go so i 'm just breaking it down merging all of these ingredients together.
you can see how the skin is just falling off.
you want all these flavors to merge.
make sure that butter gets all in.
there , oh, my goodness.
is looking good, and it 's kind of fun?
OK guys after mash it together, well, look at mouth.
hello , guys after i 'm actually gonna, look.
we 've got this amazing whole grain mash boom going to cities offer the gravy is similar way to show you.
return we go over here.
wow , that is, ready to go.
and i 'm very hard right now.
OK , so to serve it, we gotta, do itself a cool plate that gets out a nice big dollop of our mass particular that in fact, if you 're feeling flush, what you could do is piper on.
we 'd like wanna take things.
now going to shut off sausages in, you know, you could stab him in like horns like that only restaurant talk like they 're lying down on a sun bed baby.
so just going to go for a minute.
i 'm going to push this one in, in fact, i actually called a banger but let 's get off brady and just pour it all over the top.
it 's just drench it.
yeah , right here we go then nice big spoonful just completely cover it.
all my goodness look at the leak and onion sat on their hanging out, oh, wow.
i cannot wait to taste this OK folks.
i have got the perfect, thoughtful here sausage gravy and potatoes going to shut it down enough.
now i smell so good morning dearest ages and this is good for you address for most of it i love so i do n't quite that way but that 's amazing.
we did n't even do anything they sauces all the flavor.
is from the potatoes and gravy is just going boom i 'm getting gravy.
one side potatoes, over and sausage straight down the middle and that sounds rude.
but that my friends is amazing to me half an hour to make that.
in total, so if i was n't filming it may be a little less.
and we do n't have to go so flashy to put your own twist on.
