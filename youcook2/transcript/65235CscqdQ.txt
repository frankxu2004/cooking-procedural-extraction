hey , if you like korean food, then you 're going to want to check out this bagoly recipe that i have for you.
the ingredients are shown on the screen is not a lot.
but by the time you 're done, you 're going to have nice tender juicy, go get to eat first.
let 's prepare three or four cloves of garlic, then.
let 's cut a onion in half and chop it up now.
let 's also cut up three stocks of scallions and set them aside as well.
now get a large mixing bowl.
the first thing you want to do is put in a quarter cup of soy sauce now at two tablespoons of sesame E oil.
add one tablespoon of brown sugar now.
let 's also add two tablespoons of honey, add one tablespoon of roasted sesame E seeds and the final ingredient in our marinade is a quarter teaspoon of red pepper powder.
we 're barely taste now, it makes everything very well, in the bowl.
let 's put those onions end from earlier, and also the garlic and scallions as well, next, we add the beef.
it 's important to pick the right beef.
dip so we picked a thinly slice kind and the kind that has a little bit fattening.
this is n't the healthiest choice, but after you cook it, it 'll be less dry, and it be really tasty.
all right now it 's time to mix everything together, so either put up some gloves or do n't just makes everything very well and evenly in the looks.
a little, dry.
do n't worry about it by the time it is ready to cook?
it 'll be very flavorful again when you can marinate it from one to five hours or overnight, for even better results.
let 's cover this up and let it marinate in our video that meets at for two to three hours before cooking.
so we 're doing this at the table i think it 's a korean thing, but, you know, they really like to cook their meat and foods at the table and eat it while it 's fresh and hot thing you want to be aware of is that you do n't want to overcrowd the hot pan or whatever you.
we do n't have a proper cream barbecue grill.
so we 're just using this thing that we have at home, but, yeah, you do n't want to overcrowd it.
because if you do not cook, or char, as well, if i get stevie instead of, you know, like a stir fry.
so you can do this too.
but as you can see, we have vegetables at the table and we actually use half the grill to cook the vegetables and the other half to cook the meat vegetables do n't need any seasoning at all.
because the juices and flavor from the meat will be wonderfully absorbed in the vegetables and it 's going to come out.
OK , get a bowl of rice and as the koreans to directly transfer the cooked food and put it on your plate and heat, thanks for watching.
be sure to keep watching because i 'm going to have some additional pictures to share with you guys.
