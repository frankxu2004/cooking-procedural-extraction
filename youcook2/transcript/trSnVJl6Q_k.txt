hi , i 'm frankie to butcher.
let me tell you what 's for dinner.
we 're going to make a nice italian classic spaghetti and meatballs.
my favorite so far, it 's what you want to do is you get like a half an onion.
you throw it in the pan.
i got some olive oil about four five cloves of garlic and just a little bit of regional not too much, and we 're going to let that simmer get nice and hot and brown, or i 'm going to use two jobs, a source.
because we get a lot of meatballs OK.
now just let that simmer.
next what we 're going to do is we want to start out with some nice good chop meat, and i got some nice ground chuck.
so what you do is you get a nice big, big mixing bowl like that.
what i do is some nice breadcrumb.
so nice reggiano, pama gentle cheese.
throw that in there some nice fresh parsley basil fresh basil basel goal in italians at the most important greedy n't with this some fresh garlic.
maybe about four or five cloves cut up chop nice fine, and one whole onion.
i get some old italian bread.
i put it in water, you get it moist, and you squeeze it with your hands.
once that 's squeezed in its little, chopped up nice crushed black pepper next thing.
you want to do is you want to put two nice eggs.
so you got that all the ingredients were going to just mix it up with the hands, do n't be afraid you.
now once it 's all mixed?
there , really nice what you do is really simple.
and you make it like the shape of a bull and that 's it.
and once you make all of these then we 're ready for the next.
step , which is we 're going to fry him, throw some regular vegetable oil, and then we 're going to throw some nice olive oil mix.
it together now.
what you want to do is you want to make sure that, that gets nice and hot before you throw your meatballs and try not to put him close to each other, too close, 'cause you want to let them breathe a little bit 'cause they expand as you cook them, and i said to some club.
so what i do is i use that spoon that i was.
so drained somebody world.
and i also put a napkin in the bowl.
so we 're going to do is going to remove all meatballs from the pan.
i 'm going to put him in here.
mind , my hands, OK, just hey, we use our hands.
what are we gonna?
do is just play some in here real nice?
we 're just going to throw some resource over there, just to start to get someone that flavor OK.
so just let that sit look at that it 's a nice meatballs with a little tomato sauce.
meanwhile , let me check the spaghetti, and we 're going to bring it right over.
