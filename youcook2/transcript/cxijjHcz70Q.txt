we 'll just cook this for a few seconds.
let 's all come together.
and then will transfer it into a bowl.
and then we 'll start with a dozer process now that, uh, potatoes are cooked add, just removed it translated onto a bowl.
now the next process would be to make the dough cell.
so i have to buy a, a non stick.
i 'm going to put this on the goes R mode and what i 'll be doing is applying a little bit of oil.
i 'm just dipping the small chopped onion.
if you want you can also use it issue generally.

java now what will do is will add adosa.
i 'm going to be adding the batter as you can see this better is nice and smooth.
now what will do.
is take a small lazy and in a circular motion and what i 'm going to do now is going to add some oil to cook about any state if you feel like your induction is getting too hot what will be doing now is will be adding the rich ilian garlic paste by that stage if you feel it 's going to get a.
little , too hot what you can do is you can switch off the induction near the paste.
and then switch it on again not a problem it 's not going to hinder the cooking of those at all now that i 've added the oil what i 'll be doing is i 'll be adding the based here now this is nice and spicy.
so not idea, adding a lot of it.
just a little and what i 've done is i have soaked dried red chilies.

and i 'm going to take a good portion of potatoes using around two to three tablespoons now in the roadside.
what they usually do is in bombay.
they just mirror this nicely evenly if you go to the hotel is what they do.
is they just add it in.
between , and then they serve it so whichever where you want it.
we can do that now.
i 'm just going to switch this on again.
the reason like i told you before why i switched off the induction was because i saw little starting to get brown.
and i do n't want my daughter to burn, or do i want to paste to burn now.
once this is done, you know that adosa is ready.
if you want to cook this little more, what you can do is drizzle some more oil on top that is not required.
