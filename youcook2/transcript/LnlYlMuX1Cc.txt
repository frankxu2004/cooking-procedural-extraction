everybody it 's rocky.
i 'm here with my friends from fave, dietze dot com and today were going to making some new england clam chowder.
it 's going to be low in fat loan car.
but it 's still gonna be rich, creamy and delicious, so let 's get started.
the first thing i wanna, do is ground up some turkey bacon so my bacon is browned up in it is smelling galicia summer?
do is transfer my bacon on to a place in the same pot and go ahead and tossed it?
some cali flower that i chopped up in some white honey and the cali flower is going to act is my potatoes in this fish.
so i want to keep this nice and low carb, and cali flower is an excellent substitute for potatoes, understand it warm the cook and get the onions karma lies and stock about five minutes or so.
i have a can of clams right here and just open 'em up.
i 'm going to go ahead and drain them.
i 'm going to reserve the juice, though going to open up the second, can do the same?
i 'm going to mess up my clams.
alright so my onions are looking nice and translucent and soft and my colleague flower is going to limit on the ground side.
so i 'm gonna go ahead and add some keen wah flower and expand around.
a little bit adding the clam juice just saying let 's come to a boil so the juice is coming to a boil.
so i just turned it down and let it simmer on low for bed until my collie flower is.
tender , call flowers just about tenders going to go ahead and add in my clams that i 'm in stuff.
and then i 'm gonna pour in some almond milk pepper salt now.
i 'm going to let this coming to a boil.
it 's coming to a boil.
i 'm just going to toss my turkey bacon in just to add another level of flavor honestly want that turkey.
bacon keep backup, and then i think we 're ready to serve and taste test.
i 'm really, really happy with the way.
this came out we did n't use a lot of fat we did n't use a lot of flour to thicken.
but it 's still creamy, it 's still thick, it 's still rich that turkey bacon just had a little bit of smokey and sultan.
saltiness and i do n't miss the potato at all the man have the cali flower that has the same.
texture , this is definitely going in my rotation as far as go to meals.
so there we have it if you guys have any questions just go ahead and shoot them below the full recipe, nutritional facts and pictures will be on my blocks back.
