today , i 'm going to make one of the most popular pizzas that you can possibly order anywhere in the world of pepperoni pizza.
i 've made my own pizza dough from scratch.
but if you want to know how to make it check out my recipe on the channel, i 'm rolling this dough out into a twelve inch pizza base after ruling out the pizza do initially.
i 've just stretched it to fit a twelve by twelve inch piece of parchment paper, and i 'm just going to lift it up and place it on the baking trip when it has to go into the oven.
so any self respecting pepperoni pizza has to have a really kickass tomato, based source.
so i 'm going to show you how to make a really nice rich lushest amount of waste source for this pizza.
a period symptom models roughly about three hundred grams salt to taste a dash of chili flakes and oregon and finally chopped garlic clothes.
the source is reduced by half and is there complete peak booked so it 's time to just take it off.
the heat and now for the exciting part of assembling this pizza just slather on that source and just spread it out the source smell.
so good i could just eat it all on its own, and just lots of mud.
arella do n't skimp on it, be generous with it and just drop it up with pepperoni does n't that look really good i 'm going to make this.
now because i just do n't want to talk anymore i want to eat this pizza so, guys like comment subscribe, you know, the drill.
