bangers and mash with parmesan polenta, sounds good.
does n't it this dish is perfect for sunday morning brunch.
it 's quite easy to make.
we 're going to start by cooking the sausages, so over low heat.
now i chose some veal sausages.
but you can choose any kind that you like i 'm going to let the sausages cook for a few minutes in the mean time.
i can get the polenta ready now in a saucepot.
i 'm going to bring to a boil some low sodium chicken stock with some sun dried tomatoes that have sliced, this will add flavor, the chicken stock has come to a boil.
now i can add some cornmeal.
i chose some fine cornmeal so the polenta cooks faster.
i 'm going to sprinkle it on top this way.
i wo n't get any lumps and with a whisk just going to stir quickly again to avoid any lumps just before i continue stirring, i 'm going to turn the sausages around nice, golden brown color on one side.
i 'm going to let the sausages cook for a few more minutes and now we 're back to the polenta just keep on stirring.
i 'm going to continue stirring the polenta until it 's nice pic in creamy.
the polenta is ready.
i 'm going to turn the heat off and switch tool.
it 'll be easier, so i like to finish it.
ouf with the wooden spatula.
now , we 're going to season with pepper.
we ca n't forget the cheese for this recipe.
i 've chosen canadian parmesan.
but you can replace it by canadian aged cheddar.
so i 'm going to grade it right on top of the polenta, i need about two ounces.
the polenta is ready now to serve this dish.
i like to make some fresh herbs.
so i have some chives, some parsley.
and some fresh basil now for the basel, just going to slice it thinly.
this herb mixture will give a nice refreshing flavor to the bangers and mash.
just , A touch of olive oil salt and pepper.
we 're going to mix all the herbs together, and i 'll be ready to assemble the dish.
i 'm going to start by the polenta.
not too much has a rich flavor with the parmesan.
one sausage per person and the herb garnish now maybe just a touch of parmesan on top what a perfect dish for brunch, but if it's.
