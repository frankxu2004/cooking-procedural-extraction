hey welcome back to how to barbecue ride.
today , i 'm going to show you how to make one of my favorite hot dogs, and it 's the chicago golf.
i ordered some of these hotdogs strike from vienna ship from chicago.
they even sent me the bright green pickle relish the sport peppers.
even the celery salt to go with them, you can see here and today we 're going to get him out on the grill cousin chicago.
they do hot dogs.
a couple ways you could either stay more borman, some water, or you got a few places.
that 's actually phone am on the grill and create what they call the chicago char dog the one that i 'm going for.
because you go that flavor from the charcoal from the smoke gets on the outside case into that dog blisters, it up real good, and it makes it excellent.
chicago at all so i 'm going to show you how we 're going to cook those, it 's going to be fast.
there 's not much to it.
then the big parts put them together everything that goes with a chicago dog because, you know, up there, they run, through the garden.
that 's what you 're going to say.
when you go to the hot dog, places if that 's what we 're going to do so.
let 's get the cookie alright.
i 'm going to get these chicago dolls right on the grill.
nothing to it.
and you just want to get some hot charcoal.
you can use any kind of grill for grilling hot dogs.
even my five year old can do this.
there is nothing to it.
i just wanna get him cooked on our side will take a few minutes will be ready to go inside and build some chicago dogs alright.
just after about a minute half two minutes, i want to started rolling these hot dogs over you can see.
i scored the ends on a four or five AM just so they would kind of split open.
i love the way they get kind of crunchy, and just creates a little more surface area in there, and you really get some good bite on the end, and it looks cool if the presentation when you put, these hot dollars together.
but alright are hotdogs, a big grill, and just for about five minutes, and that 's how i like to see him.
i just want some grill marks on him.
i want to blistered up real good getting some of that grill flavor that charcoal taste on him if you want to take him to where there are a lot darker than that go ahead be my guest cook hotdogs, however, you like him.
but for maine, the perfect chicago dog blistered up, we got some nice grill flavor on it.
some nicer marks, all we need there we go.
that 's our grilled chicago.
dogs were going to go inside in this symbol alright, so how easy that hot dog grill, in process was all you need some hot coals from fire.
get those hot dogs on their get the outside marked off little blister on it ready, to go.
now it 's time to assemble the chicago style dogs, and you ca n't have a traditional chicago style hotdog without these poppy seed bonds.
so i ordered the bonds also when i ordered the hot dogs.
and they shipped in a freezer pack so you got a little thought out to get him back to that sauce stage.
i kind of set up my home see more at home.
i just kinda pottebaum water bowl.
and put a calendar in it with a dish towel over it.
bring that water up to a bowl.
put those buns in there, just for a few minutes and there right backs off just like the day they were baked.
so we got the buns open, here on the plane.
now we 're going to start assembling this chicago dogs.
so let 's take one of these grill ones and will just get one of the regular ones that we did split.
double couple different ways so for chicago dog, the first step is mustards.
regular yellow mustard.
and you better not come with catch, up in chicago 'cause it is not allowed on a hotdog after the mustard were coming with his bright, green relish that 's famous in chicago, and that 's really what brings the color to the style hotdog.
after the bright green pickle relish comes a little bit of chop file, an onion you gotta have all this on the chicago dallas with major.
this is what run it through the garden is so after that we 're going to tuck in a couple slices of tomato cut into little wedges.
gotta have that tomato.
i 'm lucky on this.
these are fresh out of the garden come with a pickle on this side, little tomato in this hot dog.
it 's a milina bond.
you get the salad.
now you gotta sport peppers.
and usually they have two on each one.
so that 's what we 're going to do today.
but not least you, gotta have that celery salt just a dash to top it off, and that my friends is a chicago style hotdog.
and it is awesome.
all right now for the best part of the day.
always , when you 're cooking timing it to try by there 's no way around the chicago.
you , gotta dive right in a love that chart all put it on their grills to the steam in her bowl.
and it gives the hot dogs.
so much more flavor just to get it out on the grill, even though it only takes five minutes, it puts all that flavor on the outside skin of that hot dog.
