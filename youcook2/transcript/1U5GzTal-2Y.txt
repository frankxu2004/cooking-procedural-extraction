i 'm going to show you how to make spicy to narrow, i have here.
bamboo mat, wrapped in some wraps and half sushi nori.
i 'm going to get my hand first.
the DC is a sushi rice.
we already cooked anna season in a cold.
we 're going to put in there on the seaweed and spread want to see, wait you, wanna cover seaweed with rise all over no, no peeking, and then you do n't want to be too thick layer with their rights kind of one layer of the rice.
then , you want to be even spread evenly and in many times people do.
is you just cover the seaweed with rice on the center part of it?
just the center, and that 's not going to work with, you want to cover with side top and the bottom.
also stay here.
i have sis.
me seed, just sprinkle this is going to be inside out roll.
so i 'm going to sleep over.
now i have tuna.
so you 're going to feel that tuna in the center of the seaweed about total like half inch square and the olduvai end to end.
now if we even put the spicy source here, you can put it now.
but i do n't do too much inside.
because when you roll it 's going to get like rusija, so just a little bit here down.
now i 'm going to roll pick up your bamboo.

and with the other fingers hold ingredients and then coming here and then make a tighter pick up role in the shape so that 's your sushi roll.
i 'm trying to make this shape of the role kind of square.
how depends on how you want it to be some chef.
wannabe , like little round on the top and square on the side it 's up to you by using only thing, you do n't want to do is flat.
so she ate so now i 'm going to cut the role with your knife was damp towels.
and i 'm going to cut the role in the half.
first , hold the roll on the side with your hand.
and they did the knife, go and cut it quickly.
and they, for you get a little gooey stuff you want to clean it up otherwise it 's going to get the sticky in the coming here in a cut in half again cut the half again got the half again.
so here i have plates what else you can do.
is you can add more spicy sauce on the top that 's how you make your spicy, too narrow?
