hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com.
with an italian meatball inspired prison style meatloaf that 's right, you know, that old saying, if you ca n't do the time and you do n't like me, loaf, a lot of filler, do n't do the crime will that comes from the fact that large institutions like this that have what will call a captive audience tend to use a lot of filler and bulking products in a meatloaf and while saving money and crushing souls is the main reason they do it, it does actually produce a meatloaf that 's very juicy an incredibly tender, well, i do enjoy making a meatloaf in this style and here 's how we 're going to put it together.
so in a saute pan on a medium high heat going to some butter in a little bit of olive oil and once that butter melts, we 're going to dump in some diced onions with a big pinch of salt, and we 're going to saute those stirring occasionally until they 're kind of golden brown and we 're definitely want to do this step first.
because this mixture will need to cool before it goes into the meat.
let 's go ahead and saute those onions until nice and golden and at that point we 're going to go ahead and dumping are finely minced garlic i got about four clothes, and we 're not even going to really cook this we 're just going to stir it in mixed in all will do is, turn off the heat and let that sit on the stove until it cools down to room temperature.
so are onions are all sets.
and it 's on to another step.
we want to do ahead of time these soaking of the bread crumbs, and it sees crumbs right here in particular, the amount of crumbs that makes this what i 'm calling a prison style meatloaf.
so i 'm basically going to use twice as much bread crumb is what would normally be called for in a modern meatloaf recipe, and i made these myself.
but any plane very dry, white bread crumb will work.
and then we 're going to, we 're going to pour over milk and soak, these bread crumbs for about fifteen or twenty minutes always called a slurry.
although i 'm not sure that technically correct the basically we 're going to do is mix that up and let it sit there for about fifteen or twenty minutes till it absorbs all the milk and do n't be in a hurry say after about ten minutes, they look like this, and you may think.
hey , that looks soaked.
we 're good to go.
but they 're not you 'll see in another ten, or fifteen minutes are going to look like that see how those have swollen up.
so that 's what you want to wait for.
and , once we have a runny mixture cooled and our bread crumbs soaked in milk.
we are ready to proceed with the rest of the mixture, so in a bowl i have two pounds of ground, beef.
i like to use chuck drive to fifteen.
lean to fat blend, but, eighty twenty will also work beautifully and will go ahead and seasons up this meet with some salts and some freshly ground.
and let 's go ahead.
and also give it a little shadow cayenne that 's going to provide some beautiful caged heat.
we 're going to go ahead and jump in a couple beaten eggs along with some freshly chopped italian parsley and also a nice handful of freshly, graded, reggiano parmesan, and, you know of all the things that would have trouble getting adjusted to in prison life.
besides , of course, the constant physical assaults it would be getting used to eating fake parmesan cheese cruel and unusual.
but anyway we 're going to jump in some parmesan and also go ahead and add are.
now cooled onion mixture and last.
but not least, we 're going to go ahead and add bread crumbs.
but before we do want you to go ahead and grab a handful and squeeze out any excess milk right.
we want these crumbs dap.
we do n't want i 'm dripping wet, and you 're not going to squeeze a lot of milk out.
but like i said, squeeze out what you can and then we 'll add the crumbs to the mixture and then we 'll go ahead and take a spatula and mix that entire thing together thoroughly and of course, the reason we 're using moist soaked crumbs is.
because dry crumbs pull moisture away from the meats who 's voice crumbs that does n't happen.
so you end up with a much moister much more tender product and is it starts to come together you can really see how much filler we have in here right by the time we 're done, this meatloaf is only going to be basically half meat which is.
so we 're going to keep mixing until it looks like that at which point we 're going to transfer that into a lightly greased baking dish.
are you something nice and large couple inches deep is perfect, and what you 're going to get your hands and form this into the classic loaf shape?
so , i think about four or five inches across is perfect, higher.
so , and by the way, it cake might be fine to hide a small little file.
in but with the size and shape of this thing, you could totally hide a hacksaw allegedly.
but anyway, we 're going to go ahead and manipulate that meat mixture into an appropriately shaped loaf.
and then if you want you could make it just like that, but personally i do like to glaze my meatloaf 's, and or cook them in sauce.
and because i am doing a meatball inspired version, i decided to go with the tomato sauce and the reason is that colors 'cause i added.
some balsamic vinegar, which i thought would be totally amazing, which was totally not amazing.
but in the blog post, i 'm going to recommend you just use your favorite tomato sauce.
but anyway, a little that into my dish as well as over the top and.
in addition to flavor and color it 's also going to make for a beautifully moist cooking environment, which always works when baking meatloaf and once we 've covered that surface in the sauce or go ahead and transfer that into the center of a three hundred and twenty five degree oven for about an hour and ten minutes or until we reach an internal temperature of about one fifty five right, one of the few ways to screw up a meatloaf is dover cook it.
so check with the thermometer if you can, an hour and ten minutes mine looked like this.
but anyway, once you pull your meatloaf out, you should probably let it sit there.
at least ten minutes before you slice into it, and if you do n't, i 'm gonna hear about it.
oh , someone will drop a dime on you, so let it rest a little bit.
and then we 're going to go ahead and slice in and start to analyze this alternative.
and i think fascinating version of meatloaf.
normally i would slices with my shiv, but it was in the dishwasher.
so i 'm just going to use regular knife and other than the fact i did n't like the bosonic vinegar in the sauce.
i used this was absolutely delicious and very, very meatball like and.
in addition to the extreme tenderness, it 's also going to remain incredibly juicy, i mean, look at that, i mean, is that not the juiciest, meatloaf, you 've ever seen.
let 's go ahead and cut a proper slice even though the flavors were kind of an italian meatball theme.
i still went with some mashed potatoes, and i also served it with a little bit of arugula.
but i really think any kind of toss salad would work here.
and even though i was n't crazy about my particular sauce i decided to go ahead and garnish with it anyway, you know, for the sake of the pictures.
but anyway, that 's it.
what i 'm calling prison style meatloaf like i said every once in a while.
i do like to use this method.
if made properly, miami love should bring all the boys from the yard.
and they 'll be like it 's better than mine, and if you do give it ago, i think you 'll find a guilty of being fantastic, we give it a try and hope you continue to enjoy it for at least twenty five years to life.
so head over to food wishes.
