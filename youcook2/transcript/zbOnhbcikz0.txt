it 's easy as pie to make sounds delicious.
let 's get rolling.
OK , we gotta, do first, first, i have you beat this mean.
i 've heard about this, and it 's really not going blind right now, it will not make you blind.
so you just going to hit it with a hammer.

good job, OK, yeah, and it 's not too hard.
but just flatten it out really nice, and while he 's doing that i 'm going to cut up our, our participate are basil, mom, just cutting one teaspoon of basil and one half teaspoon of parsley.
it 's all going to go run to our fourth cup of flour.
i tell you that good.
so these tenderize it.
so you want it nice and thin like that, about as thin as your pinky by fairly know what i 'm going to do is toast some bread.
we 're going to take that toast to it in the blender make some bread crumbs.
so just lightly toasted why you do that.
when cracks medics trade me, alright and my parts already done.
what 's taking you so shit sorry mom.
we 're just going to whisk the eggs for the porch trying to figure it out.
i am qualified to operate this machinery.
good to know, good to know, so, we got our good little quadrants.
yeah , you 're just going to rip it into force really easy.
OK to put this much in there at once.
it should be.
fine , right top the top.
yes , atop would be beneficial so is it more gooder more better to set it at faster.
that 's fine, but we 're going to do is we 're just going to blended into small pieces right now that 's done.
i take our parmesan cheese.
we 're going to put in about an eighth of a cup metal, forming not too much.
yeah , a little bit more than that old bread crumbs and then now we 're going to, going to blend it up to us.
nice , and, its course, we do n't want to find just nice, of course, so go ahead and hit it brother to help yes well, done.
this is good.
this is the proper way to do this, call it.
that 's good now.
we have to do nothing, poured your bread crumbs into our flower.
parsley and basil mix.
i 'm just going to stare him around towards no problem alright.
really , you know, what let me, let me go ahead.
and for you OK dad to do this.
all right grab the chicken there.
you run the egg and make sure the whole chicken is covered.
and he 's going to, you 're right in there and throw it gently places at least a little bit more disgusting than i thought, i was going to be here.
we go now flip it over.
i do n't really want to know you got it.
you have the dirty hands and then you want to make sure it 's all nice, and covered so just keep flipping until it 's nice and cold again.
that 's, that 's good.
it 's good, yeah, and pick it up.
he 's kind of tap off a little bit.
the excess go right on our plates is that bad chicken.
we 're going to throw this right into the fryer.
it 's going to get golden brown and look delicious awesome right on right.
so we got hot oil here just enough for it to float in, or sinking.
we just want a nice golden brown.
we flip it at all.
yes , we 're going to flip it, but we want to go around in each side.
OK , so do i have to make a mess.
or can i do a.
good , you can do a good.
i do n't have tongues because we 're four.
i 'll do it.
more gooder, there you go sorry.
more better it 's almost there, well, i, i need it now.
oh , OK, right now you do n't mind seminella.
do you now OK?
nice golden brown, my son.
we put our chicken plant or a nice clean plate.
then we want to take some parmesan cheese because it is chicken parmesan.
after all more barber john, that 's right, the cheesier the better just covered up, and, then some homemade marinara, you do n't have to use homemade you can use store bought.
but homemade can be better OK.
so you have a mirror on right.
so we 're going to cover it with mozzarella, and even more parmesan.
because we want this to be as cheesy as well.
so both good, already right and more, parmesan, oh more parmesan, and then we just loaded or oven, which is already freaking added three hundred fifty degrees and we 'll have a meal, you know, normally cooking shows they have n't made one already in there right.
but we can cut that i 'm an in five minutes.
it 'll look like half a second right well cut time for them.
but i still do n't have my food well, OK alright, so our tickets been there for about five minutes just about done.
or it is done.
we 're going to give it a little side of spaghetti, got it looks like a mess not just a little bit for a little bit of pesto cream sauce.
so it looks really good.
so now it 's time to find out if it really is that 's your finished project.
let 's find out digit.
hey talk to you.
meat is tender ha.
it 's going to be hot right out of the oven, do n't burn yourselves at home other than the intense heat?
what do you think what the hell why is that really good?
that 's actually really nice.
like i guess really good so it 's good, it 's good, we have our DJ of approval.
