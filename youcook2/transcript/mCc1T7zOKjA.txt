hey guys hope you enjoyed my field trips.
i 'm so pumped to be back in our taste, made kitchen, you might be able to tell it looks pretty different.
we got a facelift here and the first thing i 'm going to show you is a raw vegan.
pad thai let 's go make it.
hey , look at all these vegan and gluten free and also not gross ingredients alright.
so there 's no getting around it you 're eating.
seaweed hear the good news is.
it does n't taste like it.
because it actually takes on the flavor of whatever you 're cooking it with.
so i 'm going to start by cooking my kelp noodles which goes a little something like this there.
they cooked all you have to do is so can drain these noodles.
it just softens them up a little bit, and make some easier to eat, so, while these soak we 're going to go ahead and make our sauce, which is pretty much just as eazy i am just going to dump a bunch of stuff in the food processor, so.
let 's start off with our almond butter.
this is going to make it nice and creamy and add a little bit of sweetness as well.
some tamari, which is kind of taking the place of fish sauce in this recipe and tomorrow is gluten free.
it 's like a gluten free soy sauce garlic onion, which i 've just kind of really roughly chopped here.
maple syrup just to give it a little bit of sweetness and some red pepper flakes, and i 'm going to add the juice of one lime.
i like to roll it out before i juice it just 'cause it kind of softens up the flesh.
and i think it makes it easier to get the juice out.
i just gotta squeeze it straight in OK and now we 're just going to let the food processor do all the work OK.
and my noodles are done.
these have been drained and rinsed and just so we do n't have a lady in the tramp situation with these really long strings.
we are going to kind of chop them up into bite size pieces.
just makes it easier to eat.
and i 'm using kitchen shears because it 's super easy and you can actually hear the texture of the noodles.
they have a bit of firmness and a little bit of crunch to them, which actually make some really good this looks good.
and now i 'm just going to pour the sauce on.
i told you this is easy OK and now.
we just tossed the sunset.
so i 'm just mixing it in.
i 'm trying to get all the noodles well coded.
they 're kind of soaking up the sauce a bit.
but that 's it.
we 're really done now, we just get to plate it up.
and now it 's really just a matter of garnishing.
i like to add some scallions.
so i 'm just going to chat them up really quickly.
so i 'm just breaking these up a little with my hands to get some nice thin rings and not a whole chunk of scallion.
these guys allowed a nice crunch.
now i 'm just going to add a few leaves of cilantro and you bean sprouts crushed almonds.
and some sesame E seeds.
these are black sesame E seeds.
i just like to look them use any kind and that 's it.
you can really pad yourself on the back for making this pad thai and get it.
