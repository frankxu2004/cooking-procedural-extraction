hi , welcome to show me the curry dot com, am anuja and today we are making falafel now falafels do not need any introduction?
very simple recipe again very simple to make it at home, so, let 's get started falafels different countries are different.
regions have different recipes.
so this is the recipe that i thought, i like the best.
so i 'll be showing it to you so here i have taken.
one cup of garbanzo beans or chickpeas or an i had soaked it overnight.
so one cup of channels approximately two hundred grams.
so just to give you a rough idea i watched it and i soaked it overnight with lots of water an morning that 's it drained out the water, it again give it a rinse in the clean water, an right to use now.
the falafels do.
not you do not need to cook the channels.
you do not need to cook the ronzo beans, so we have a full process server here.
and you need a food processor for this blender going to cut it.
you 're going to have a paste, and you do n't want that you want a little texture near falafel.
i 'm going to just put chickpeas in, here.
i have drained out all the water and i 'm going to process it till it becomes like a breadcrumb kind of texture.
i look at this, just like bread crumbs will put it into a bowl.
you can see the consistency pure for look at it.
this is exactly how we want it going to keep it aside, but the food processor back on, and i 'm going to add in some garlic.
i 'm using about six pieces of garlic against caleb, scale down depending on your taste.
but the blade in there before i forget put it in that, take a, a small red onion.
big bind in staten and small by US standards.
but just rough chop it because it is going to go into the food processor, so why waste time i 'm going to give it a quick quarrel.
once so get a little head start.
and i 'm now going to add in some herbs.
so i have over here.
some meant leaves.
absolutely divine, again little showoff moment from my garden.
so i 'm going to just use a handful and for mint leaves, unlike cilantro leaves, or coriander leaves, you do not use the stem.
these stems are still a little tender.
becaus , i 've just pluck them.
miniature there 's softron just the best for you guys, but usually there a little tougher.
if you buy them from the store and i 've watched it and i 'm just going to use them.
so i 'm going to take out all the leaves.
this is a good handful.
i have a handful of parsley flat parsley over here again.
beautiful , beautiful, so i 'm going to chop them up.
roughly an it 's going to go in there, the mint leaves are going to go in there an equal amount of coriander leaves or cilantro leaves.
so again, i 'm going to chop them up properly and put them in there.
so let me get this started, OK, once everything is in no turn it open scrape down the sides very important and one more world there you go this place smells amazing look at this.
so i 'm going to take this back here.
now i 'm going to combine this.
i cannot tell you.
now if you follow all the people who like spicy food at in a green chili along with your onion and your garlic, and you all set look at it.
looks so beautiful.
i 'm going to mix it absolutely fantastic.
i 'm going to add some seasoning to it.
but one of the things i want to mention is that if you 're going to be making it a little later i would suggest you add the salt last.
otherwise , all those greens will let the moisture go and, including the onions will let some oyster go.
and you have like a soggy mess and to this, we 're going to add about.
nor one teaspoon of ground, black pepper adjusted to your taste, and add in one teaspoon of human powder.
now if i was not using as much cilantro or coriander, i would add in some coriander powder.
think i got plenty.
i 'm not going to use that, but if you cannot lay your hands on that fresh stuff because that 's the best just do this.
i 'm going to also add in about a two tablespoons of lemon juice.
one tablespoon of olive oil mix.
now this is really green.
and that 's exactly how you want it so little bit here or there, as far as the herbs are concerned.
trust me, it can only get better falafels are inside are usually green and a lot of falafels use follow beans.
some of them use cooked chickpeas recipe that worked really, really, well for me grad in one teaspoon of baking soda, not baking powder.
i 'm using baking soda directly.
because there is lemon juice in there, it is going to activate it.
so i do n't have to worry about half a teaspoon of kosher salt, you can always adjust later once you taste it.
and i 'm going to mix.
it 's now the salt and baking soda needs to be added, lasts or just before frying K, i 'm going to give it a little try.
here , the salt is good, but i need a little bit more lime juice so ads just half more tablespoon at this point.
i 'm going to cover it and i 'm going to put it in the fridge, while i get the oil heated up.
so about fifteen twenty minutes maximum, that 's all i need.
so that way it will just set the, the flavors, and all will go into the garbanzo beans, and it will be really easy to form balls also to make the falafel.
so it 's been about fifteen twenty minutes.
the oil is hot.
it 's reached approximately three hundred fifty degrees wait a hundred and eighty degrees, centigrade, you do n't want it to get hot like black on the outside you wanted to cook a little bit inside.
but not get try.
so here you go going to give it another good mix.
so if for some reason you 're the greens are left the moisture go and become very watery.
but this is good like see.
if your hands are like wet, it 's perfect.
but if for some reason you 're not able to form the falafel balls or just add a couple of tablespoons of all purpose flour, you will be fine.
but i like to make my falafels thin.
so that way there, krispy, some people in some regions make it round.
and that 's also fine.
i 've actually abused upanija, rampan, and made them because i did n't want to waste so much.
so that 's always a good idea.
this is about the size.
i like to keep it flatten it out and, and it does n't need a whole lot of time.
it needs very little amount of time on both sides and as soon as you see it kind of color, changing a little bit, and you 're going to flip it around.
you do n't do not need to deep fry.
this , if you 're making, it flat and that 's one of the reasons why i like to make it flat that way i do n't have to use up consumes.
and this is done.
will pull it to the side, and i got a plate with a, with a towel on it, gonna mix put it on that, an i 'm going to carry on and do the rest.
so the falafels are ready i 'm going to give it a shot.
you open it up, it 's still so moist inside, and the outside is crispy.
love you, love you grumble that, that you can hear me chewing.
so here 's a great example, about the outside being crispy, and the inside being soft and moist.
i know if you can hear it, but it absolutely amazing i just love it.
and this is how i like to serve it.
we have a little bit up rockets over here.
you can buy them from the store or you can have a video on it, you can check it out just cut it up, quarter them for a little falafel in there for a little bit of tahini sauce fabulous and come on.
