hello , this is chef john from food wishes diacom with creamy mushroom braised meat loaf that 's right.
instead of cooking meatloaf and making a mushroom gravy for it.
i wanted to know what would happen if i did those together and would happen was a pretty delicious lunch.
so here 's what i did, i made a meatloaf and i was totally going to show you the recipe for this.
it 's a three meatloaf pork veal and beef.
but i was n't completely thrilled on how it came out, right the texture was really good.
but the taste just was n't quite what i wanted.
keep working on that and show you my three meatloaf at a future date.
but anyway, the rest of this will work with any of our pre, existing meatloaf recipes, or whatever is currently your favorite meatloaf recipe ideally one that pairs well with a creamy mushroom sauce so, once your meatloaf, mixtures together, i want you to form it into a loaf that 's about six inches a crossed maybe three inches high.
now you can do this on a sheet pan or in a big wide bowl like i 'm doing it 'cause we 're going to want to be able to do is slide this push.
this off creamy mushroom braising liquid, which is actually the topic of this video recipe.
so how did we make that we 're going to take six ounces of shit talking mushrooms and as you may know, you ca n't use the stems there.
just a little too tough and fibrous.
so just go ahead and pull those off, you just want the caps and it 's nice if their whole 'cause we 're going to slice these up.
but if you break do n't worry should taki happens alright.
so slice those up.
and at that point we 're going to head over to the stove where i have a large skillet on medium high heat, with a lot of butter when i see that foamy part of the butter.
start to turn a little bit ten.
i will throw in those mushrooms with a big pinch of salt, and we 're going to cook those until well browned alright.
so stage one, they 're just going to kind of get, i do n't know.
slimy and those kind of sizzle like that, and then if you keep cooking, and it will dry out a little bit and start to brown nicely like that at that stage i 'm going to add a pinch of fresh rosemary, mister that just goes a couple seconds.
and then i 'm going to add my flower to this, which is going to make.
so we 're going to stir in the flour.
it 's going to get all clumpy and kind of dry and kind of ugly looking that 's OK, we just want to code the mushrooms with the flower were going to cook that for about three minutes, just like that 's not going to look good.
it 's not supposed to do n't worry.
we 're just taking the raw edge off the flower at that point.
you 're going to pour in your cold beef broth, maybe half a cup at a time just poured in wisc poured in wisc, the stock.
the broth is cold and the rule is hot.
there 's no lumps.
so stir that in are going to turn the heat up to high bring this up to a simmer and of course 'cause it 's a rue as soon as it comes to a simmer, it will thicken up.
we 're going to season that with salt and freshly ground black pepper so that 's going to come up to a simmer.
it 's going to thicken up and at that point we 're going to turn off the heat, and stir in our heavy cream, OK.
and that 's basically it.
so now we 're exactly at the stage you saw at the beginning of the video when we slid are already formed meatloaf into the skillet.
so one tip make sure you make this sauce in something that can go into the oven, 'cause that 's how we 're going to cook this now.
the next time i make this.
i 'm going to put it in the oven, like this brown the top, and then based it with this mushroom sauce here i was.
so drawn to that sauce.
it just kept telling me please spoon me over that.
meatloaf , i could n't resist sometimes the urge is just too strong.
and i gave in and i spoon that sauce over the meat loaf.
and i put it in the oven, and it still was fine.
but i think i will brown that first.
next time alright that went into a low oven, three hundred twenty five degrees in thirty minutes or until an internal temperature of one fifty five.
at that point it was done and that 's looking very rustic, you could slice, and serve just like that.
but because that meat did cook in that sauce lots of stuff came out from that meat juice.
the proteins kind of coagulate it underneath.
so you do have some stuff going on in that sauce.
so this is something you definitely need to skim the fat off the top.
i actually skim the fat off the top and in the pan for about five minutes to thicken it up a little bit.
but anyway, i 'm sure you figured out the rest.
slice me love pour over sauce eat with mashed potatoes.
i did n't even pretend to have a vegetable side dish with this.
so my theory here was the meatloaf will flavor the gravy as it roast as it braces which it did.
and also cooking the meat loaf on top of the sauce would keep the oven.
so how did it taste the sauce.
excellent , the texture, the moisture the meatloaf excellent.
but like i said i was n't thrilled with the actual meatloaf itself.
but this technique i think, was worthwhile?
and i do think the meatloaf definitely, definitely improve the flavor of the sauce versus, just making it separate.
so anyway, the next time you 're planning to make meatloaf.
if you 're a fan of mushroom sauces, maybe give this technique a try.
and of course head over to food wishes, dot com for all the ingredient amounts as well as more info as usual, and as always.
