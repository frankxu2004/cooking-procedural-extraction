but that 's actually a lot of the ways that it comes to sexually very safe, in good for us.
but you really need to know how to treat the fish when you buy it.
so most of the time the fish you can get from your local fishmonger, alot of supermarkets will have what they call isaku block, which is generally a block like this, you would buy the fish frozen it 's usually cry of act in the real way to handle it is to let it thaw overnight under refrigeration.
so what you would do is usually leave it in the rap or take it out.
rap it neatly in a little paper.
towel put it on a plate and let that thor overnight in the fridge.
so you 're finished product.
