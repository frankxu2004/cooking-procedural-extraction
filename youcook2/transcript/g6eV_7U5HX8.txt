hi , everybody, and welcome back to cook and share today in this episode we 're making up the healthy bean burrito as you probably know.
there are many different types of feelings.
you can put in burritos, but this one contains no meat but is nevertheless, fast and delicious so.
let 's get started.
so what i 'm going to do to get started here is add the refried beans to a preheated pain.
you can pick these up in just about any grocery store.
we 're going to add some chili powder here, and i 'm going to stir a continuously over medium heat for, oh, i 'd say three to four minutes, just until it 's hot.
now that the refried beans are hot i 'm just going to set this aside.
so what i got here, is a pan preheated over medium heat?
but i 'm going to do.
is place my flour tortilla in an.
i 'm going to eat this for about a minute on each side.
now this is about a nine inch tortilla.
and you can pick these up in just about any grocery store.
or you can make them from scratch, and of course, i 'll put a link below now that my tortilla is heated up.
i 'm just going to remove it from the pan and set it aside on a plate.
the first step in building our burrito is to place the refried beans on to the center of the tortilla, and spread it out.
just so it 's about an inch and a half away from the edge followed by the iceberg lettuce.
the diced tomatoes onions, the black olives, some jalapeno peppers, a nice layer of salsa.
now this is just medium salsa, you can use hot or even mild for that matter the sour cream and last but not least the grated cheddar cheese now.
i should add at this point in time do n't fill the burrito two full or you 're going to have a difficult time rolling in.
so to roll this.
i 'm going to bring one edge up over the toppings and tuck it under just so.
it 's nice and tight and continue rolling it till it 's just about to the end.
now what i 'm going to do is take some sour cream and spread it over the end just to seal it up next.
i 'm going to tuck in the ends now.
you do n't have to do this, but it just makes a really nice presentation.
lastly , i 'm going to cut the burrito, diagonally, and you 're ready to serve and there you have.
it are being burrito served up with some salsa and sour cream on the side, a great no meat.
