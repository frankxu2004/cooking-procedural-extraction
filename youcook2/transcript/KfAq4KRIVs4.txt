i 'm going to use this pressure cooker, so it is very, very easy whenever you are cooking without fat.
you want all the ingredients to cook really good.
so what we 're going to do they 're going to add all the ingredients.
i 've got some green chilies.
i 'm going to add some onion.
one tablespoon of coriander powder oper, teaspoon of garam, masala, portal see, because we 're not adding any while we 're not saying anything.
so i rather use grammar spelling portal, then whole gram masala.
and use one tablespoon of ginger garlic, paste to the folder to your taste, i 'm going to add a half teaspoon of chili portal.
very little of turmeric add half of the coriander leaves.

but i 'm not going to automatically into this.
because i want this needs to be cooked, well, if you add some of those into this, the maid is going to be a little bit stuff.
so what i 'm going to do.
i 'm going to add this tomatoes at a later point of time, and you can add one half cup of water to this.
see , you can notice this lamp has some fat little bit attachment.
and , that is good enough and actually.
in fact, the fact, that is there on the meat itself gives very nice flavor.
so i 'm just going to mix this little bit make sure you do not have too much quantity in a pressure cooker.
it is less than fifty percent of the total capacity of your pressure cooker.
put the list and switch on the stop, a lot of times people cook their food, based on the number of visuals, so, if you cook your regular meets, with two results cook this lab thanks for three results.
after three visits switch, on the pressure cooker and wait for ten minutes for the pressure cooker to cool down and then before you open the lid, make sure you release the pressure and then open the lady.
so OK, now look at this.

it is coming off the bone that means this made is really nicely cooked.
but i want to add some tomato puri.
so what i 'm going to do first i 'm going to remove this meeting.
so this is another reason why i kept this meat into big tweezers.
because i want to remove this big pieces out easily.
if i had small pieces, it would be very difficult to remove them now.
i 'm going to add this freshly ground tomatoes.
i 'm going to add to this, if you want you can put the pressure cooker one more time and the starter will be cooked in no time.
