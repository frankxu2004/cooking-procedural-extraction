the we are the three amigos, hi, this is rob lafond of the three amigos chefs, and i 'm here today in the J T M cafe to prepare for you, a wonderful stir fry dish and what we 're going to make for you today.
is stir fry general souls chick in and what that 's going to entail is a crispy fried chikin that actually will have a very, very nice batter over the top of it is going to be combined with bell pepper and onion some nice broccoli florets.
some scallions, and then i 've got some thai bird chilies here as well which is going to give it a little bit of heat boost.
all of that will be finished or glazed with our GTM 's general so sauce.
and this is a sauce that contains a nice blend of ginger and garlic.
some sweet and sour properties.
and then it 's got a little bit of kick or punch to it.
but before i start with the dish i just want to talk very briefly about the process of breading the chick.
in , in how you achieve that great crunchy texture, an essentia lee what you 'll do is combine equal proportions of cornstarch and flower that.
in addition to a little bit of sesame E oil about a half a tip teaspoon of sesame E oil in a teaspoon of soy sauce to give you a nice batter sort of a tan colored batter and you achieve that by mixing it with cold water.
so this is going to be the wet aspect of the tempura breading, and then what you 'll do is take simply take, a combination of cornstarch and panko bread crumbs an, that is in a three to one ratio.
three parts cornstarch one part panko.
and what you will achieve is nice sort of dry coding that 's going to supplement.
that wet coding, and it 's going to give you a real crunchy texture.
what you 're going to end up doing is frying this product twice.
you 'll fry that a low temperature about three hundred twenty five degrees, and then once you drain it ouf it 'll go back in at about three fifty to three seventy five for another couple of minutes, and you 'll get a golden brown crunchy texture much like we have here today.
so what i 've done is.
i preheated my saute pan.
i 'm going to take just a little bit of sesame E oil.
just the coat the bottom of the pan i 've got some, some diced onion.
and i 'm going to take an equal part of onion.
an red bell pepper ann for this particular batch.
i 've got about four ounces of each, and then i 'm going to supplement that with little bit of our scallions, get that aroma going.
and are thai bird chilies, and i 'm going to go on the light side with this due to the fact that our general.
so sauce is already going to have a little bit of heat to it.
so once, i get those, those items going a little bit, will get a moving around in the pan i 'm going to add broccoli, and for those one parts of onion and peppers i 'm going to add two parts of broccoli.
so you 're going to have a little bit heavier concentration of those broccoli florets i 've blanched them already.
so it 's really just a matter of getting to heat through.
and then what i 'm going to do is take my crunchy chick in that is still warm.
going to combine it here in the pan.
and we 're going to get a little bit of heat going on that product as well, so this is just a great product.
it 's very, very universally accepted in recognized as probably one of the more popular asian dishes out there, so it 's on trend.
it 's just what you 're looking for.
it 's a great menu solution, really for any operation whether you 're talking hotel restaurant cafeterias, corporate feeding schools.
it 's got universal appeal from kids all the way up to the adults.
so as we get our chick in incorporated with the vegetables and heated we 're going to add our general.
so sauce and really just to finish.
we 're just going to bring it up to temperature, which will happen very, very quickly in the pan, and we 're going to plate here in just a second and i 've got a little bit of noodles already prepared on our plate here with a couple of scallion brushes, and we 're going to play that up.
notice it 's got just a tremendous amount of color very vibrant flavor.
and this is one that will be a menu favorite for years to come this, this is a timeless, timeless dish, so there you have it.
our general souls chick in an come back and see us next time.
we will have some more great menu solutions for you and have some fun in the kitchen.
