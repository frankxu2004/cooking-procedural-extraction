please take a moment to just quietly read the three words on the blackboard, here.
i 'll wait how you feeling, you know, few such arrangements are capable of stimulating so much desire.
so much nostalgia so much saliva, and yet for me.
these words represent disappointment dishonesty and disillusionment that 's.
because whenever and wherever people say, there gonna make you a grilled cheese sandwich what they really mean is there going to make you a griddled sandwich containing some melted cheese will not me know, when i say grilled cheese sandwich, i mean, a grilled sandwich containing grilled, and here 's how i do it, you 're going to need a charcoal grill notice here that i 've got a large at chimney starters, worth out of charcoal already started and piled up just on one side of the grill yes see.
i use natural chunk.
because i 'm naturally chunky as for the actual ingredients for two sandwiches.
you 're going to need four half inch slices.
a good hearty country style bread, or you 're going to need some fat for this.
if you 're a better fan, go ahead and spread a little on both sides.
if , however you prefer olive oil.
two were just a little bit closer to the fire time as for the cheese, i believe that two cheeses are better than none.
i want sharp, but i want nutty too, and i want a little spice.
i want the edges to crust yet.
i want a high gooeyness factor.
so i 've got three ounces of extra sharp cheddar cheese and three ounces of gruyere, and yes, i graded them myself.
i can tell the difference by the way, no pre graded back stuff or i 'll find out about it.
and i 'll be unhappy alright.
come here secret weapon is that i add spices alright.
i stir in teaspoon richard.
half a teaspoon of smoked paprika and a quarter teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper.
now you could leave any or all of these out.
but you 're not going to, and we both know it good.
now as far as hardware goes, i have got my favorite pair of spring loaded talks and check this app two grill spatulas with minor augmentations.
i 've used my favorite multitasker heavy duty foil to make them both into shallow trace with just a little bit, and here is why i 'm going to evenly distribute the cheese on both half goes there, half goes there, going to spill a little.
once the way it goes down with the cheese down off direct hit you on indirect heat on the cheese, or it will burn are going to have to move this around and shifted several times during the six to nine minutes.
it 's going to take to get nice and bubbly and listen.
hey , hey, seriously when this stuff starts bubbling, do n't look right at it, or you will become hypnotized.
i promise i 'll leave that alone, let 's prep the bread now.
i do want to go with olive oil.
so i 'm just going to kind of spritz this down likely, on both sides.
i do n't care if it 's perfect coverage you can use a brush if you want to.
and here 's the danger.
this stuff could burn so you 're going to have to really keep an eye on it and keep it moving.
i am not going to leave this spot now that the bread is down.
move see that was obviously a little warm, so we 're going to move it over here.
alright going to take that one off and go to the foil that 's going to be percent which one.
i say these guys go pretty well, together.
we 've got to move the cheese over, and this is a this is going to be a lot easier and it looks kind of fold down.
the , the lips, a little bit slide on to the sandwich bread goes over and then just wrapped that up going to put this back on the heat just for a couple of minutes.
so that she 's in the bridge can kind of get to know each other now.
let 's build this other one among out.
you go that my friends is a grilled sandwich prepared from grilled cheese.
now , i know some of you may complain that the spatulas actually function as a griddle.
but , you know, what in the words of my thirteen year old daughter whatever remember america.
