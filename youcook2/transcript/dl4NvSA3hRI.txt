pizza M finity say, hi, and i 'm cathy do you think today we 're going to make a base if she can fire eyes or carpet couple.
so let 's dive right in with your basil chicken fried, rice, the first thing, we need for fry rises four cups of cooked rice OK and that is jasmine rice right, and.
now why do you use jasmine rice types prefer adjustment rice and jasmine rice is actually long grain fragrant rice and that 's that i favorite alright and.
next is six cloves of garlic and to tie chili peppers.
so depend on how spicy you want and of course, if you do n't want it spicy to leave it out i was smashed are these together in the motor here.
OK , when you do this, you have to be careful.
and then why you smash again, can you just chop everything up?
yes , you can do that, but this will bring out more flavor of the garlic, and chili peppers.
you can actually just use a big knife and lay it flat and smash everything under it.
if you do n't have a mortar and pestles.
but if you 're going to cook thai food a lot, definitely invest in one of these, 'cause it makes everything taste way better.
so how sign are you smashing this, it does n't have to be real, fine just to release all those flavors and break it up.
so you do n't get a huge fight at chili 's or huge fight of garlic.
this is about just right alright looks good.
and i will heat up the oil now.
medium heat for now, just to heat up the oil K.
you 've got a big walk there.
and how much oil are you going to use quarter cup vegetable oil alright, and we 're using medium heat at first.
so that we do n't over cook the chicken.
no , we do n't have burned a colleague put, that chicken in that way and we use hockey.
OK , good channel and garlic when it burns, it gets a yucky bitter, bitter flavor.
OK , i start to see the smoke, so this is good terms.
you put that alec and chili pepper in how are you to cook the, oh, just a few seconds, and.
now you 're going to cook the chicken all the way through this club, maybe half a poop and this is oyster sauce.
three tablespoons, an i put in one teaspoon of sugar and that oyster sauce is a chinese ingredient right and two tables through enough with sauce and fish sauce, is a staple of thai food?
it 's made out of anchovies or other small cyst, and then they put the small fish into these large jars.
and they mixer fitted with salt water.
and then they read the jars in the sun for several months.
the fish actually dissolves and then it gets all nice and very, very salty and at this point they add some more liquid to send it out right, and that 's what their sauces is a staple of thai food is i got a nice meaty flavor that salt does n't tend to have.
so twenty five years ago and my mom first came to america from thailand seatac to faller bags ready to go.
and she filled her suitcases with fish sauce.
and then she got off the plane and my dad had seen her suitcases full of fish sauce.
and he just started laughing year time.
people cannot live without fish, then turn on the heat, higher OK.
now we 're really cooking and now put in the rice, OK and again.
how much prices at full cup except rhe and this is a great meal, especially if you 've got, some leftover eyes sitting around.
because nothing makes it better fried rice than day old rice could the little dryer.
so the rice holds its own very well yeah, when you stir fry on high heat burn.
so we cook this until the ship and typically how long does it take three to five minutes, OK, depending on how hot your stove is, and we 've got a really hot fan.
so ours will be quicker than most OK, when she can is.
so i put in this is from one red bell pepper, OK, a whole red bell pepper, thank you read their paper.
fun friendship , OK.
and i will put in about to cut up fresh basil, a mouse.
so great that basil is a key ingredient in this recipe to annaba heat.
so you do n't want to cook the beautiful.
let 's put this in the bowl.
here you got a nice bowl.
i 'll be there area.
and i honestly think if i had to pick one thing that i had to live off of for the rest of my life, it would be this chicken basil fried rice i love it looks good.
and this is how we serve the spicy chicken fry rice with sweet basil thai.
people always eat fried rice with it cuts down the spiciness.
gives it a nice crunch and the cool flavors with the spicy flavors taste.
so good for cilantro right to put it on top K as a garnish and cilantro something that i 've grown to love.
