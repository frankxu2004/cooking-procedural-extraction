hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with minestrone soup that 's right.
the classic italian soup roughly translates to a big soup, and that 's exactly what this is big flavors, big everything, and by the way, i 've never made this the same way twice.
and neither should you.
so this time i started off with a handful of chopped pancetta they called italian bacon, but it 's not smoked.
i 'm going to saute that over medium heat and a little bit of olive oil not quite browned almost when it just starts to look like it 's going to brown throwing your onions.
i am also going to dump in dice celery, and i 'm going to cook those vegetables for about four minutes until the onions just start to turn translucent, and by the way, i did n't drop a black olive into my pot.
there 's a little chip in the bottom of my dutch oven, do n't be alarmed at that point?
i 'm going to add some minced garlic a good amount.
i think i have like four clubs.
we do n't want to brown that.
of course in and just cook that for about a minute alright.
after the garlic cooks for about a minute, we 're going to dump in our chicken broth and some water and one can of plum tomatoes that i crushed with my fingers, you could also use.
of course, crushed tomatoes diced tomatoes anything you want give that esther we 're going to bring that up to a simmer, while we prep.
are beans, now you can just use all can beans for this?
but i had these beautiful cranberry beans, so gorgeous, and delicious is you.
gotta , take him out of the pods.
all right, just like shelina P, so i did that and i had about just over a cup of cranberry beans also known is shelling beans for obvious reasons.
i 'm going to dump those in.
i 'm also going to add some chopped cabbage very classic minestrone ingredient.
i 'm going to spice it up a little bit with some red pepper, flakes some dry italian herbs and a big pinch of salt are going to give that esther, and i 'm also going to add a can of drained and rinsed beans.
i really like garbanzo beans in the soup, they had just a little bit of extra substance and meatiness and i like him.
so i put him in, but really any can being product will work in this.
when that comes up to a simmer.
i 'm going to turn my heat down to medium, low, and i 'm just going to simmer that until those cranberry beans are tender.
it 's going to take about forty five minutes, and while that 's happening, i 'm going to prep another critical ingredient.
the greens i 'm using swiss chard in this case, i have a nice big bunch of swiss chard very thoroughly.
you can use the stems and the leaves for the stems, simply slice across like that and sort of a small dice for the leaves.
i go one way, then it kind of go the other.
there 's no wrong way to slice swiss chard.
so , relax, OK, so my greens are prepped again.
make sure those are thoroughly, thoroughly rinsed.
we 're going to go back over to our soup pots, and you 'll notice me adding water here anytime.
the soup looks like it might be getting a little too thick.
add some water.
we need enough liquid to cook the ingredients again.
we need enough liquid to cook the pasta OK as soon as my shelling beans, my cranberry beans were tender.
i 'm testing one right there.
i 'm going to dump in my green store.
those in i 'm going to simmer those for about fifteen minutes and we are getting close to being done look how beautiful that is already and i do n't even have the past in speaking of which we 're going to use ditalini these little mini , tubes.
the official pasta shape of minestrone and, i know, what you 're thinking.
that does n't look like very much.
there 's no way that 's enough, amazed like two thirds of a cup.
here is enough for this giant pot of soup, right before you add the pasta very critical adjust your seasoning.
i added some black pepper, i tasted for salt and added more salt alright.
so you want this soup to be fully seasoned especially for salt when you dump in that pasta are going to jump in the pasta.
you 're going to turn your heat up to medium, high, you want this to be simmering pretty good.
so the pasta cooks, and just does n't sit in hot soup it 's later as soon as the pastas tender, you 're ready to ladle that into some hot bowls and serve this magnificent and big soup.
i like to finish mine off with some extra virgin.
olive oil just drizzle it right over the top, you know, that one were telling you never to cook with to save it to finish things.
that 's the one we want you to use here.
also , a light dusting of reggiano parmesan does not hurt and is highly recommended and then to brighten it up a little bit at a little freshness and color.
being partially, i do n't forget the big hunk of bread and then you 're going to dig into wanted to best soups.
ever invented so comforting, delicious and relatively healthy for you, and like i said, this is made differently every time.
if you want to put keratin put carat, if you have green beans put green beans in that leftover bell pepper in the bottom of your vegetable crisper dice that up and throw it in there is no wrong way to make minestrone.
so i hope you give it a try head over to food wishes dot com for in amounts, as usual, and as eloise enjoy.
