hi , i 'm emily, and i want to show you how to make a delicious beans, and pasta soup, a true peasant dish from southern italy, you 're going to start off with some pancetta going to saute it and let it render the fat just to get it a little bit golden, and crispy.
then you 're going to add onion garlic little bit of salary and just enough hot pepper flakes to get a little kick.
let that cook for a bit just to soften or your can of tomatoes in a blender and buzz it up until it 's nice and smooth.
you 're going to add that to your vegetable mixture, along with your bra, bring it to the boil and then reduce the heat.
let it simmer for about ten minutes.
you 're going to finish it off with a little bit of basil after that you 're going to add your beans.
anuta tally pasta any small possible work.
but the tubes are one of my favourites, let it simmer for about eight to ten minutes until your pasta is.
nice and tender.
this is a hearty meal, and it 's perfect with some nice crusty bread.
