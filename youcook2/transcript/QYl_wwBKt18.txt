hello , and welcome to easy gluten free, they 'll be showing feed healthy recipes dot com how to do a copycat version of cracker barrel 's hash brown casserole now.
there 's no shortage of knockoffs for the recipe.
but all the ones i 've seen call for a can of condensed cream of chicken soup, which usually contains gluten i 'm going to show you a gluten free alternative to that ingredient, i 'm also going to lighten it up with lower calorie swap outs from some of the original ingredients.
so you wo n't feel too guilty with this version or intimate.
this , you 're going to need a thirty ounce bag of defrosted frozen hash browns or you could just great two pounds of potatoes yourself.
if you want one large onion that 's been peeled and finely diced twelve ounce can of evaporated skim milk, two teaspoons of chicken bouillon, granules make sure it 's gluten, free, if you 're on a gluten free diet, a cornstarch slurry which is one tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with two tablespoons of cold water until you have a lump free mixture.
seven ounces of low fat, greek yogurt, six ounces of grated reduced.
fat cheddar, four tablespoons of melted butter, two tablespoons of diced butter.
one teaspoon of salt and a half teaspoon of pepper.
now first preheat the oven to three hundred and fifty degrees spray a nine by twelve inch casserole dish with nonstick spray to make the cream of chicken soup in a small saucepan.
add the evaporated skim milk and the bouillon, granules and stir over a medium heat until the bouillon, dissolves.
and the milk just starts to come to a boil, then add the cornstarch slurry, and stir for one to two minutes, or until the mixture thickens remove it from the heat and pour it into a large mixing bowl to cool down.
once it 's cooled add the onions.
cheddar yogurt, salt and pepper and melted butter, then stir to combine in a very large bowl.
sauce , mixture over the grated potatoes and mix until everything is well combined.
now pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish and thought the top with the diced butter, which will help you get nicely browned on top bake.
it for fifty five minutes to an hour or until it has the color that you want on top if the casserole is in his dark, as you want after an hour you could stick it under the broiler for two to five minutes when it 's finished.
let it stand for ten to fifteen minutes to set.
and then it 's ready to serve.
now this one has all the creaminess of a casserole with hash brown potatoes, playing the leading role.
it 's great with any meal.
so why we eat for breakfast.
i initially had mine for dinner with some roasted chicken.
and a small salad or for all you breakfast lovers out there, rest assured the leftovers were reheated.
the following day to make a phenomenal addition to this mid morning beast, i ca n't think of a better side dish with sausage bacon eggs or whatever breakfast fare.
