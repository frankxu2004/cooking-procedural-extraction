so i 'm going to take my scallions again, again.
we need to find chop on these, and it was some butter, but i 'm also going to use cold pressed irish rapeseed oil.
fantastic product cold press is better for it, it really is good brings out flavors.
i love this structure of it.
just , you know, when you mix it with the butter, offensive butter from burning i 'm getting scallions in here in a bit of salt pepper.
what i 'm waiting for that to heat up.
i 'm going to prepare the car detail.
cardi cal has a little spine in the back of it, see it.
we do n't want to eat that.
so i just pull it right off discard that the rest were going to chop more in that sitting there going to get my curly kale in sweater more a little bit.
take the crunchy alatis sticker on his out of the pre cook.
some roosters peel them boil them, children match them and they 're going to go in here, we 're going to put some butter into this sixty grams of butter.
it needs a little milk got lots of elements even senior potato.
and you got minimum senior curly kale as well as a perfect way to use leftover potatoes like, takes ten minutes.
