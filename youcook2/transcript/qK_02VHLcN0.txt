hi , everybody work on to my kitchen.
today , i 'm going to show you how to make kimchi in three simple steps.
step one wash and cut.
step , two salt and brine and step three to flavor with the basic sauce.
i have here, a four pound napa cabbage.
and i 'm going to divide this into four equal parts to do this cut about a quarter way down from the bottom and pull apart and repeat the same steps with the half pieces.
so that you have four equal pieces.
the best way to wash the cabbage is to fill a sink with water.
put the cabbage in the sink and as you pull the leafs apart shake side to side and lift up, and down take off the excess water and drain in a calendar.
repeat three to four times each time with clean water.
here we have the four quarter sections washed and cleaned.
traditionally , the quarter sections are left intact and that 's the way I like to make mine.
but today we 're going for fast and easy so.
let 's cut them into bite size.
pieces cut the roof portion, this card, and then cut into one inch sections.
like so then transfer these into a bowl.
we 're now ready for step, two salt and brian proportion of salted cabbage is one two, one, one tablespoon of salt, two one pound of cabbage.
i like to use kosher salt.
it flavors the best here, i have four tablespoons of salt since i have a four pound cabbage sprinkle.
the salt and gently toss to evenly coat the cabbage.
let this sit at room temperature for about three hours, we tossing once or twice in between that helps to evenly brine the cabbage.
we 're done with step.
while the cabbage is being salted, let 's make those basic sauce.

we 're going to add one cup of red pepper flakes available in korean markets.
a three quarter cup of fish sauce without MSG thai fish sauce is fine.
one tablespoon of granulated sugar a third cup of water and five stocks of diced green onions mix gently to combine.

the south has been sitting at room temperature for about ten minutes, proportion of sauce to cabbage is quarter cup to pound of cabbage.
let 's set aside a cup of sauce.
since we have four pounds of.
cabbage , and freeze the rest.
