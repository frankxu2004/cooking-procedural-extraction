hey guys, OK.
june , a recipe, which is cottage pie, is absolutely great for this time of year?
it 's not quite into spring or summer, is still quite cold, outside, so this is a real winter warmer sort mail.
i actually love cottage pie.
this recipe is eleven pro points per serving, and it serves four people, so first thing you want to do is have kind of water and bring that oil.
i 'm adding five hundred grams of sweet potato, five hundred grams of normal potato.
so need to lightly salted water just to get it going, yeah, at these, and.
now it 's not quite boiling yet.
but i know it 's going to get going.
so i 'm going to add this, and as you can see it 's aloft potato.
so you might need quite a large source plan as well.
so just add the sweet potato in the normal potato together.
so we thought potato.
i just peeled the skin and cut it into cubes as well, and meanwhile, while that 's boiling away.
it needs to be boiling for about twenty minutes, just until it 's tender anyway in another pound.
i 'm going to add just check the weight of this, this is four hundred grams of minced beef.
i 'm going to add this not all at once it needs to be a handful at a time.
so , after in they just want to brown this often quite high heat.
and then just keep it steering until the minutes is browned.
keep adding bit by bit and today.
if you want to add one small onion that 's been chopped buying ling.
but in one carat that 's been chopped finely on megyn cause, yeah, that 's been chopped finely fifty grounds of sweet corn and one hundred grams of green beans chopped.
so if you got a good stir.
let 's have a little bit of fry as well.
also , you want to add half a teaspoon of mixed herbs as well.
i 've got this fear, just half a teaspoon.
do that in my actually want to ask and three hundred milliliters of water, which is half a pint of water at that in western and then want to leave this to simmer uncovered for twenty minutes, hey guys.
sorry , it just wanna add something i told you to add the sweet corn to the minutes mixture before you leave it and cook for twenty minutes.
that 's actually wrong.
you do n't have the sweet corn, you obviously point at the end when it 's all done cooking, i 'll answer anyway, so, yeah, living not cooking there.
so , do n't push this week on it?
OK , the potatoes are done.
so i 've trained them all to put them back in the pan and use them, uh, sure just to match it all up, make.
nice mashed potato, OK and season.
this now, with some a little bit salt and pepper and you want to switch the grill on it, does n't say what he.
so i put it on two hundred degrees centigrade.
and that 's one on the grill.
and a large bowl that you can developing in so preheat this in the grill and now is the time that you would add you sweet corn as.
well , it was fifty grounds of sweet corn.
and you need four teaspoons of gravy granules just dry granules, and just pulled it in.
and give it a stir until it.
thickens , but my mixtures are ready going to take the large bowl out of the grill.
first , pour the mints mixture line looks like that.
what do you say for that into the bowl, just flatten out.
so it 's all kind of even and that would be mashed potato mixture looks like that and put this over the top spread?
it down again as well, very colorful.
actually , i go back about the sweet potato, OK.
this is what my grannys to do.
fork , and just the top they put it back in the grail and just leave it in there until the top is nice and ground.
but you can take this out of the oven that 's good, so the top is now ground that says four people.
so i 'm going to cut into four pieces.
actually , really big serving stay, i just want to serve this immediately as well.
that 's good really good and that 's not.
i hope you enjoy this video and hope you choose to make it yourself as well.
it looks like a really, really hearty meal really good for this time of year when it.
so cold outside and stuff.
so sitting with your nice cottage pie see you soon.
OK , i 'm just going to try some now so i can tell you what it 's like to be too hot.
that 's actually lovely all these augments.
mixture is really rich in flavor.
i did n't expect to taste the gravy granules as much as you can.
but it really gives a nice taste and with the sweet potato, it gives it more of a sweeter kind of taste to it.
that 's really lovely and there 's a math that is a big portion for eleven points.
i 'm really pleased.
