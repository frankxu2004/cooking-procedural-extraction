now i want to cook with the pecorino back at home and are going to make a spaghetti carbonara and this really hard cheese is perfect for it.
the other thing of course is a good chunk of pancetta will punch.
chatter is very light bacon of course, subtle difference being that it 's cured for longer that is salted and hung up in drawing sheds a bit like parma ham for much longer than bacon therefore, it has, a more concentrated flavone is absolutely essential in a load of italian dishes gives a lovely sort of meaty salty flavor in the background just chop it into chunks or lardons or as they say in italian, cute betty little cubes.
now one of the things i had picked up in italy a little tip, which gives me a great pleasure is how to open a packet of pastor do n't mess around with the potato and will get a knife just go like that, not show start his loads of stories as to where carbonaro comes from.
but one i like most is actually from the second world war when there all the GIS were over in rome and that they had loads of bacon and eggs and.
so the italians presumably acquired them in a legal or illegal way and came up with this dish bacon, eggs, and pasta.
so with the pancetta i put in about three cloves of chopped garlic, a good fistful of parsley and spaghetti, which goes straight into the pan, not a little tip out of picked up in italy they often use a little bit of cooking water of the pastor just to make a bit of source perfect another strong contender for the origins of this dish goes way back in time today 's of charcoal burners who worked outside the walls of rome, it said, they used to cook bacon eggs and cheese on their hot shovels hence charcoal carbon carbonaro this is nearly as popular as spaghetti bolognese.
so long ago, who said it came from rome, he said never use parmesan in carbonara and never use cream as a bit, barris, 'cause i was used to using both.
so i said what about pecorino then is it alright to use sardinian, pakarena, yeah, yeah, he said that never cream.
