why do n't we make some muscles in a spicy tomato sauce?
but we 're going to use a vodka sauce, you know, like ten elaborate casassa for this kinda sorta.
this is absolutely splendid.
very easy to make.
let 's make this.
i 'm going to cook this in my electric wok, so that you can see what i 'm doing better.
obviously you can make this any scale that you want.
so i 'm going to add some olive oil.
and i 'm going to add a finely chopped onion.
we want to cook this for a few minutes until it 's nice and stop in and translucent.
but i 'm going to add four garlic clothes, which i meant compare for a couple minutes and.
so you can smell it one minute, i 'm going to add twenty, eight ounces of chopped tomatoes.
these are actually hold tomatoes.
i just chop them, you can use crushed.
you can use chop.
i 'm going to add some oregano.
please pull up.
shut up always.
this is optional.
and then i put half a teaspoon of chili pepper in here up at half a cup of vodka alright.
i 'm going to lower the heat and let this cook for about seven minutes, so all that alcohol evaporates OK, i 'm gonna season.
it with salt and pepper taste it and.
you , like, OK, now we 're going to put the muscles in, here.
i am nearly i 'm going to be using greenshell mussels.
they already come in the half shell.
so , i 'm going to put him in here statement for about three four minutes, and they 're ready.
if you 're using whole muscles, you 're going to have to wait until they all open which should take about the same time.
the ones that do n't open, you get rid of, OK, they 're not.
they 're not OK, had been a cover?
this , and i 'm going to let this team for four minutes, max, you should do the same.
regardless of if you have the whole shell or not OK, OK these are done so i 'm going to fish them out and put him in a bowl.
i 'm now going to add half a cup of cream, uh, this is just heavy cream.
we really do n't want that to boil.
we want it to just you know, heat through i 'm going to taste this for salt.
no , it 's perfect.
i 'm going to return the muscles, keep them a little more and served having the sprinkle a little bit of basil leaves that i chopped.
