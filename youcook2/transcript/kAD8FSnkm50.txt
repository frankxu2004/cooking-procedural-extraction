do we have?
hi guys welcome to my youtube channel allergy.
only food and today making very eastern european and russian dish called better nicki, which are the dumplings are not filled with meat which are pelmeni.
these will be filled with sweet stuff like jam or cherries or cottage cheese, which i 'll show you today.
they actually originally come from ukraine, and we 'd them a lot in my beer.
they eaten all over russia and today, i 'll bring them to you OK the ingredients for the dog really simple, and it 's the same method of making them as pen.
many , which i will put the link below we 've got four hundred grams of plain flour.
one tablespoon of costa sugar pinch of salt.
i 've got two eggs and a cup of water, which will be using depending on how much the dough needs for the fillings of cottage cheese.
and i 've got sweet cherries.
so i 've taken the dough when it 's all combined and.
now we still need to need it for quite a while until it becomes really, really easy to work with an elastic.
so just take it folded.
take again just do that.
put some flour.
the surface knit shirts and stick.
OK , it 's all done very easy to work with.
now very elastic, all we have to do is.
now wrapped in foil and put it in the fridge for half an hour.
OK , so my job is been refrigerated for about half an hour now.
all we have to do is roll it out into sort of a big, big square and into quite thin pastry.
so just do it slowly.
it 's quite easy to work with.
put some flowers words in space.
so , just rolled it all out.
i cut the edges off to make a square.
so we wanted to the same freaking pieces.
now , with a knife or anything sharp you have just going to lightly scroll down and make equal squares.
OK , so i 've got my feelings ready.
i 've put some costa sugar into the cottage cheese because i like it sweet.
you do n't have to do that you can make them salty as well.
so i 've got my chair is here.
so all we have to do is just touch the square.
then i would say put about two, two cherries in the middle and then we just pinch it from the top just like that stone inside.
just pinch it from this size, well, need to make sure it stays together?
otherwise , it 's going to open while it 's cooking.
and make these kind of.
triangles , just like that.
them , on a plate flower plate.
and do the rest OK.
these are all done.
i 've got the cottage cheese.
and cherry filling, i 've actually also tried some with strawberry jam.
and so we 'll see how that turns out.
so i put my boiling water here.
i 've added a bit of salt in a bit of sugar because it 's past us.
so we need to make sure it does n't stick together.
so when it starts to boil, which is going to drop in our very own key in and cook them for about five to ten minutes.
once they dump i 'm going to save them with some sour cream, and jam.
OK , it 's all done steaming hot looks absolutely amazing.
i put some cherries and a side and a cup of smith on a sour cream on top.
maybe another cherry just to make it look really, pretty ca n't wait to eat this.
OK , i 'm going to get in colon open.
now when you cut it open.
see the chairs just in there.
all looks good.
but of sour cream, i 'm about these are made about, i know, what i 'm eating for dinner.
now i hope you try this recipe if you enjoyed it.
