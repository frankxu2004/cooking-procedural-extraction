some fried chicken going on their people chris, your career path dot com, welcome to my kitchen today quick and easy, well, not so quick.
what a flavor of a death.
the ultimate island style fried chicken just about four pounds of chicken in the entire chicken that i cut up into pieces, and i washed it with the juice of a lemon and water drained dry an, i left the skin on their purposely 'cause i love that little texture and everything else to the batter is going to hold on to that skin if you want to take the skin off you can certainly do that an entire chicken that i cut up except for the box there 's no meat in the back, and we 're going to marry this first, you 're going to go in with some salt some caribbean style pepper sauce, and this is where you going to get that lovely little kick from some fresh ground, black pepper.
and we 're going to go into with some caribbean green seasoning in the description of the video, below.
i 'll have a link for how to make the caribbean green seasoning and all.
it is it 's a blend of all the different fresh herbs that we like using down in the caribbean and the final thing.
i 'm going to go in there.
where does a piece of ginger, and i 'm just going to break in a little bit of ginger, if you got ginger powder, you can use that mix that up and allow that to marinate for couple hours in the fridge as the oil.
i 've got some maybe about four or five cups of maybe four cups of vegetable oil heating in a walk and i use a walk.
because of the high sites prevent a lot of splatter from going on the stove.
so , while the oil heats on a medium high flame i 've got my flower and just all purpose flour.
but it 's going to season up sort of batter the pieces of marinating check in with finch assault pinch of curry powder, and we want to go in with a little bit of smokey, caprica.
so all i 'm going to do.
now is mixed that up and then we 're going to get to sort of coating the pieces of chicken with that, just whipping a couple large eggs in a bowl here and i 'm going to pour it all over that chick in and again.
we want to make is that really, well, they want to make sure every piece of chick in is quoted in that egg mix.
basically all you would do now is grab a piece of that seasoned and marinated chicken roll, it around in the flower press on it a bit.
and then you would tap it set it aside for going into the hot oil.
but that final step of putting that beat in the couple beaten eggs in there, going to allow this flower to stick on to give us a lovely batter sort of batter for friday 's chicken i would do it in two batches becaus i do n't want to overcrowd the pan.
so let 's try one more piece there we go remember to shake off the excess flour and get ready to go into the hot oil.
the first batch is in the oil.
how going to give it about ten minutes on each side on one side, and they 're going to flip it over and make sure it 's completely covered in the oil of the other side, that is and let that go for about another ten minutes or so.
i did n't cut up the chicken in two large pieces.
if your pieces are very large, while then the cooking time will have to increase by a little bit.
but all you need to do now let that go for another ten minutes, then you will need paper aligned bowl or plate and the country.
not the excess fact.
he 's out of here the first batch going around the color.
i got them back the first batch is ready to understand and remove it and put it to drain on summer on a wire rack with some paper towels below just a source just to get rid of all that extra grease on there.
so second back is going to go.
and at this point getting out the last batch, lovely color again, you know, simple chris, do n't leave you guys?
run remember, that is, only when we get a recipes are there with you right here is nice big pieces of chicken breast size.
