hi guys, i 'm bridget davis.
be internet shift and today.
i 've got a little recipe for you.
i want to teach you how to cook the best scrambled eggs.
so , first, if you want to come down here and see what i 've got in front of me i 've got three free range eggs.
i 've also got just moving to develop tablespoon father and a little bit of sea salt flakes there.
an in the jug here i 've got about a third of a cup of cream, so, in order to make the world 's best scrambled eggs.
you need to break here three X into a little while.
i once you 're in the bowl, avoiding the egg shell, of course, we 're going to add our third of a cup of cream to that little bowl OK over here.
we 're going to put the pan on amazing a nonstick pan, which is really, really important.
i 'm using the induction cook top and i 'm turning on the pan to induction, stating eight, which is about medium to hot on your gas for your electric cook top.
they 're going to take a fork.
is arpan is heating up and just mix the cream and egg together , there?
what i 'm trying to achieve it, just that yoke is mixed through.
so i do n't want any tricks of yolk egg mixture and azar pan, is heating up?
i 'm just going to take just a smaller snob of better there, and that 's going to begin to melt through.
i 'm also going to take a little bit of our sea salt flakes.
they 're going to go into the base of the pan which is going to help those sea salt flakes to start to dissolve their the heat from the pen.
so bacterial egg mixture is looking pretty good.
the yolks are mixed through nicely one, how better to start sizzling once it got this little sizzling action happening here.
now in our pan almost ready to put out egg yolk mixture.
and in order to help me make this, this, this scrambled egg recipes successful.
i 'm also using a flat ended wooden spoon as i talked about this.
is a non stick pan as.
so now i 've got this is all happening.
there 's no color of my better, which is also really important.
i 'm going to drop my eggs into the base of the pair now.
what you need to do is you need to resist, resist the urge to scramble your eggs.
what you want to start happening is that egg yolk is going to set just, sit on the basis that pan.
so about twenty seconds once you put, the egg mixture into the base of the pan you want to wait about twenty six before you even going to start to attempt to scramble as i 'm shaking the pan as you can see.
what 's happening at this little bubbles beginning to form down there, so, i know that proteins sitting really, really, well.
so once i 've got my bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.
my bubbles, starting to form, i want to take my flat in the wooden spoon and begin to.
very , very gently.
nudge these eggs around the pen.
as i 'm nudging the cook stuff.
the rockport stuff is then taking its place just enough time for me to grab a little bit of parmesan cheese and create then 'cause it 's going to help with the flavor perfect vector wooden spoon.
give it a bit of an edge.
so the cook stuff makes way for the role steps of what you were getting.
was the most gentle and delicious lightly quick scrambled eggs, and that pretty much is it once you 're at that stage?
we turn it off and the heat that slipped in their scrambled eggs will continue to cook us through.
and you will guarantee have on the best scrambled egg recipes ever.
