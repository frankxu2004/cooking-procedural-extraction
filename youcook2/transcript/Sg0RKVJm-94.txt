hi , everybody S catalina, and today, i 'm going to make sour craft, i really, really love sauerkraut is just such a delicious condiment and is so.
so nutritious as well.
i really like it because it 's very easy to make.
and it just makes everything taste better, you can always buy already made sauerkraut in shops.
but the problem is that it 's usually pasteurized.
so you 're not getting any good bacteria in there, and really.
that 's the whole point of eating sour craft.
so when you make it at home, you know, what you 're using, you know, ingredients that is there the bacteria.
is gonna be there?
it 's very important that you use organic cabbage really, the base of sarah pratt is cabbage.
you can add any other spices or vegetables you want.
but the basement is cabbage and you want to make sure it 's organic.
becaus , whence, organic really cabbage homes covered in a little bacterium really good bacteria for your card, and all organic vegetables are.
but when you 're using a pesticide a product that has been treated with pesticides by bacteria is not there.
and they 're not so nutritious anyway.
those vegetables sing when you were fermenting this organic cabbage.
and you put it in the salty water, all that good bacteria is going to multiply and basically the cabbage becomes a lot more nutritious than when you 're reading just raw cabbage.
sauerkraut has a lot of health benefits.
i really like it because it improves digestion.
and when you have it, you do n't have like a whole little bit.
you have it as a condiment and basically is going to help you absorb the nutrients from your food is also going to give you all the in science, you need to digest your food allergies evenly strengthen stealing mean system, and i really like it for skin.
so you 're struggling with any skin problems and sour kraut is gonna be amazing for it and like i 'm saying.
so easy to make.
so i 'm going to show you now, what you need to make first of all, you will need some cabbage.
alec using both green and purple cabbage and really one large one is enough to make about two liters of sauerkraut.
i will also add some fresh carrots.
a big piece of fresh ginger, but you can add any spices or herbs that you like.
also , add some fresh garlic cloves.
green chilies, and lastly you will needs about one or two tablespoons of salt for your brian.
the first thing i 'm going to do is remove about two or three of those outer leaves of this cabbages.
discoveries are very big.
so those lips are very old and very tough and they have some holes in them.
so i 'm going to be discarding those and then with these leaves, the time left, i 'm going to take about three, or four.
and i 'm going to wash them in some filter water, and i 'm going to set them aside, i 'm going to be using those at the end, i do n't really watch the whole cabbage.
but if your damage is dirty, and you want to wash it make sure you using filter water that 's very, very important.
and now i 'm going to start the slicing, the cabbage.
the first thing i do is remove the core.
and then i end up with a bottle for big pieces, and then i 'm going to start slicing it very, very thinly once.
i 'm done with the cabbage.
i 'm going to place it into a clean stainless steel pot.
i 'm going to sprinkle some of the salt on top of it, and i 'm going to leave it covered while i process the rest of the vegetables.
i 'm also going to great the carrots, and i went to chop, the chiles very, very small.
i want to be using their seats because then it 's this spicy.
i 'm also going to be grating the garlic and chili, and i 'll be adding them on top of the cabbage.
i 'm going to give that a little a good mix, and i 'm going to add the rest of the salt now you sing, these would pounder.
i 'm going to start mashing all of the vegetables, and i 'm going to do this for at least five minutes.
this is going to release all the juices from the vegetables and as what you want because then you have to add less water.
and you can see how the look of the vegetables change.
they start very crunchy, very crispy and then after i 've done this for awhile they become a lot softer and there is a lot of juice at the bottom and.
now i 'm going to start packing the sour craft into a clean mason jar and the way i 'm going to do.
it is i 'm going to add a little bit of that into the jar.
and then i 'm going to press it down really hard.
and then add a little bit more.
and , and do that with the pounder again.
and what you want to do is remove as much air as possible and pack it very, very tight.
and then you can see how it looks from this side, that is, a lot of juice in there, and i did n't really add any water to this, this was all the juice that was released from the vegetables.
however , i know you did n't get a little juice.
you can always add some filter water, and now with the clean leaves.
i had set aside and went to start falling them and putting them on top of the vegetables, the purpose of this is to use the muscle weight that is going to keep all of the other vegetables, submerged underwater that prevents, any fungal growth in your vegetables and then i 'm going to place the lid of the mason jar very loosely and i 'm going to let the vegetable sit undisturbed for anytime between a week and a month, well, i hope you enjoy this recipe.
i would love to know you have had any experience with aircraft, so, please let me know in the comments down below and thank you for watching bye.
