below this is chef john from food wishes, dot com, with hash browns.
this classic breakfast potato is so easy to make, but apparently many people do n't know how this is done.
so i 'm going to show you, and it starts with two russet potatoes, and i 'm using two because i a lot.
one potato per person for hash browns already got my pula ready you do n't have to peel them, but i recommend you do.
and then you want a box grater, something nice and sharp.
so after our potatoes are peeled, and great those into a bowl of cold water and that is plenty of footage of me, grading.
so moving on after their graded we 're going to go ahead and want to rinse off that starch.
still cloudy that water is that starch is one thing that will prevent a nice crusty, hash brown.
now you can just put this in a stranger and run it, underwater in the sink.
but i ca n't get a camera in my sink.
so i decided to do it in a bowl.
so actually rinse this twice so that was the first time i drained it added.
more cold water always cold water.
give it a little stir, poured off that start you water who is D starched enough for maine, so i drained it.
you want to make sure they 're really dry, so let him drain well and then for extra dryness.
i like to put him on some paper towels and give it a little squeeze.
so long story short great, some potatoes rinse them and make sure there is dry as possible alright.
we 're headed over to the stove and i 'm going to put some clarified butter in a heavy skillet on medium heat, and, you know, clarified butter.
we microwave it and we just use the oily part.
we try not to get any of that liquid that settles at the bottom.
i 'm recommending a nonstick pan, a very, well seasoned cast iron pan when you believe the butter to be pretty hot, go ahead and throw in your potatoes.
and we 're going to cook this on medium heat pretty much.
the whole way.
so i want to even those out.
and we 're just going to let those sit there getting the initial crust, while we season and the seasoning on hash browns should be very simple.
so we 're going to go with some salt and generous sprinkling of salt so cayenne pepper.
of course, some finely ground.
but freshly ground black pepper by the way, get a pepper grinder using pre ground, black pepper that was probably ground in nineteen ninety seven and last.
but not least a little bit of pep rica gives it a little color.
is it a touch of.
sweetness , and really that 's it.
that 's all i think should be in hash browns, having said that as you well, know, you are the boss of your breakfast potatoes.
support would you want alright, so, after about five minutes, i decided to give this a little stir, and you can really see.
let me give this a little flip.
you can really see that cross starting to form, so at this point if you 've done everything as shown, there 's really no way to screw this up.
look at these until they 're done.
now , there 's two schools of thought, you can just let him sit leave him be the outside will get crusty, and the inside will stay kind of.
white look like shredded potato, or you can use my method.
i like to keep stirring the crust as soon as it forms back into the potato.
so i let it cook for two or three minutes.
i take the spatula.
i flip it over that crusty surface comes up sort of gets mixed back into the potato, and then it re crusts.
so right about here most normal people would be thinking they 're done.
and they would be, do you like my cooked well done?
i just like to let mine sit and get crusty and crustier, encrust fear, and the insight almost turns into like a mash potato.
but that 's just me, you do it, how you want.
so that 's what mine looked like.
when they were done of course it would look better if i 'd focus the.
camera , but you 're going to see in a sec.
they looked amazing, i threw it on a plate not surprisingly next to a couple eggs.
and , you know, what i like my eggs that 's right, little cayenne.
anyway , there we go classic hash, brown potatoes, super, super ultra, simple technique, but maybe if you 've never seen it before that 's how easy.
it was alright time to dig in and do n't get me wrong.
i love a nice home fry, but there 's nothing like homemade hash browns.
crispy , crusty, buttery on the outside, soft and tender and comforting on the inside is just magnificent.
and in case you 're.
i do an yes.
i did i loves me a little catch up on my hash browns and proud of it.
take that europeans, so i hope you give that a try soon.
