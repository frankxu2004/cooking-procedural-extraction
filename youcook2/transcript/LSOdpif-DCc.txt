i start by saying it 's very easy, very simple.
and it is i always go for fast quick and delicious tasting food, and in general everything, anyways, we 're going to start making our adult.
and we need some yogurt water and make sure that you got this wrong temperature and water is warm.
and if the yogurt is called just at half wild, on it, and it will become just the temperature we need just give it a quick mix.
some honey not too many ingredients.
honey alright, an for the drive chip, mix it in to incorporate everything together, and we need some salt traffic.
my mom and a half tablespoon and always makes after adding in another ingredient, of course, it 's a bright we need.
and i 'm always using instant yeast for most of my grades, so we do n't have to activated.
that 's that set another quick mix.
and we can stop adding our flower or and i forgot the olive oil about two tablespoon, or so, i forgot an ingredient anyway you can start adding the flour, and we need as much flour as it needs to become a soft.
but non stick it all.
it should take trouble with three and a half horse depending on what kind of yogurt you use, depending.
i 'm using full fact by the way, and do n't add three and a half cups of flour at once just earth.
as you go, like you mean, prince more and when it 's already starting to come together just start adding the flower later by later you do n't wanna extra flour and have steve bread.
and i 'm using regular all purpose flour.
if you want you can also use whole wheat flour.
just substitute another cup or just use instead of, yeah, all purpose use.
so i can needs with my hands and when i 'm done with the door i 'll come back and show you the rest.
