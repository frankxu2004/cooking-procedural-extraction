hi , fi chip, my name is toy myers.
ann i am passionate about spice and mexican food and today.
i 'm going to be cooking you the best ever.
state tacos with my favorite, very salsa and this one is a real corker, so.
let 's get cooking.
so the first thing i 've got to do is make a marinade for my steak.
the state we 're going to use today is skirt steak and this money will just tenderize it and really bring out all the flavor.
so i 've got my garlic clove.
i 'm going to add a pinch of salt and just mash it up.
last salt, this garlic is ready for the marinade, got my skirt steak, just going to throw that garlic in.
we want the juice of half a line.
i 'm just going to squeeze that lime in and that acidity will really start breaking down those C news there.
we are bit of pepper pencil assault and just a tiny bit volleyball.
and he can sit marinating for half an hour, an hour four hours really, whatever you like now.
i 'm going to wash my hands ready to make the best ever salsa, so mexico making the best salsa is a fiercely contested competition.
everyone make some fresh everyday.
this is my favorite one.
i think it 's delicious.
so , first of all, i 've got some garlic cloves.
i 've toasted in a dry frying pan and look how easily this skin is just flaking off and toasting.
the god it really, really softens the flavor makes it much more gentle and gives a quite a nice child edge.
so brave the tomatoes and the garlic of dry roasted and frying pan.
and this method of cooking is archetypally mexican.
and it adds a wonderful child flavor into your salsa, hosted delicious and are some people might think that looks birds.
but i swear it gives the best, best way virtual salsa.
so go with it and test it out , yourself.
so in they go i 'm just going to gently work these tomatoes into immersion now.
of course, you can use a food processor here, but the texture just wo n't be the same.
so you can see that with a pestle and mortar.
you really get that texture if i put this through a blitzer.
it would just be completely smooth puree whereas here.
i 've got a lovely rough textured, and you can see some of that black and skin which is going to taste delicious.
so now that, that 's into a rough kind of mush i 'm going to add some onion and some chopped coriander, and, and rest of that ghost.
we 've got some onion.
so the idea is not only going to give their salsa a lovely freshness.
the sharpness the acidity of the onion is actually essential for the salsa.
but also that lovely crunch will give you texture in the salsa, so was it thousand missing chili.
you ca n't have a salsa with actually, so this is partly an adobo, chipotle.
the smoke dried jalapeno if you ca n't get ahold of any of the shops.
just use a jalapeno freshwater fresh green chili roast.
it just the way i did for tomatoes shove it in that will give you some lovely heat to it.
add a great tablespoon.
and it 's going to give this salsa a bit of smokey wonderful heat.
so i 'm just going to start this round gently not need some fresh lime acidity, you can always use vinegar.
the mexicans love vinegar for cutting through rich flavors.
but i 'm going to use fresh lime near half a lime should do it, and it goes, and, that is my southmayd.
now all i need to do is cook my steak, and we 're ready to your tacos.
so my skirt steak smiley my hand is really hott just going to shake the access marinade off and in it goes to the pan, while that 's cooking another perfect compliment for state taco a spring onions.
but we want them nice and charred.
i 'm just going to roll them in that lovely olive oily marinade and put them onto this pan.
and we want these spring onions to be really nice.
and charged just like in the markets and they are.
so good in these states are just going to season with a bit of lime, and they 'll be delicious.
and there 's that steak we 're going to leave him to rest on that board and that all i need to do is heat up my tour tears.
i 've got some call ones here, but you can use flour wraps you can kind of use anything really.
i 'm going to just put them on my flat top gear.
sprinkle little bit water on oil.
so now i need to cut that steak.
so the most important thing with skirt steak as you can sit across the grain not with the green.
so i 'm going to pass it across the grain often second, gorgeous that off is delicious.
but some meat right make some attackers.
OK , got my tour tears got some steak, got that salsa full of that smoky, chipotle flavor.
those charred onion, this is just going to be a mouthful delicious salsa smokey fiery full of flavor.
i completely fresh bit of avocado and avocado squeeze the fresh line and those delicious spring onions.
they just need all that line over two time to talk in that stake.
the creamy, avocado that 's much appreciated that is met some street food at its finest sensational.
