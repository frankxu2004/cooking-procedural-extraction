i started my journey on the southeastern coast of thailand, just near the cambodian border.
a place steeped with culture history, architecture, and of course, really great food i think i found myself in one of the most quaint streets in thailand historic street in junk tabori along the river.
it 's absolutely incredible and i 've packed myself right here.
alongside this lady who 's selling these khanom.
it 's like a sticky rice in young coconut, wrapped in the leaf that they fetch rules with, and then grilled over charcoal.
but i 'll have that later what i 'm going to cook now.
is pod tag, long got guy, which is a pad thai using chicken and prawn and the noodles actually made right here in this area?
so , first we 'll just lighter gas.
OK pad thai is very simple.
but you have to watch it, and you have to stir regularly.
OK , we 're going to start with just a few tablespoons of oil and the first thing to cook is some garlic.
but not onto higher heat and just let the aromatic characteristics of the garlic come out and, once you can smell, the garlic, we add the chicken and prawn busy little straight so.
what do you have?
and then next we had some tofu.
the tofu ads in lovely true to the dish, and always pad thai tofu.
next , we 're going to add the noodles and the noodles have been soaked in water really important in making pad thai to soak the noodles in water overnight, and that way you do n't have to add any more liquid to the dish that we add, one egg just correcting just move the egg around.
let it cook before you stir it through the rest of the noodles.
OK , some tamarind, tamarind makes it nice and sour and then a touch of brown sugar just about one teaspoon is perfect and then we add some fish sauce some oyster sauce just a tablespoon and then we finish the dish using some garlic chives just torn up, turn off the heat.
some been shoots mix through, and the final ingredient.
just some pickled, diakon just have a quick taste splash.
more fish source, and it 's ready to go OK now whenever you serving any type of noodle dish iOS.
suggest using tongues, and then lift the noodles out of the walk and then when you put them down.
give them a bit of a twist just to give us some extra height.
and then let all the goodies land on top OK to finish that off a couple of wedges of lime.
some more fresh ben shoots on top and some of the whole garlic chives that you just pick up and true really simple and then some peanuts over the top and there you have it popped.
igang tough guy, right here in the most amazing street in santa maria.
