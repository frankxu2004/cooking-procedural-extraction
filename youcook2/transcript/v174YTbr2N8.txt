the first thing that we 're going to have to do, and you see me do this before when we 've done a few burgers is just grab some baking paper on a flat surface now.
the burger patties on a whopper are a little figure than we 've done before, so grab a little bit more ground beef.
now this granby again is an eighty twenty split, so it 's twenty percent.
fat audi percent beef.
so it 's going to be nice and juicy just mold it into a ball and just put your baking paper and just grab a rolling pin and what we 're going to do is just roll that petty into a nice shape, round shape.
so try and get the best shape that you can guys and just roll it up.
decide that and what i want you to do just for those rough edges just using your fingers to go around and attack them in a bit, and just keep repeating that process guys until you 've got as many burger patties that you want to make going to do the whopper what you 're going to need is a grill menu can do this on the barbecue, or, if you got, one of those grill pans you can do it inside.
but i 'm doing it outside.
be cause of the flame grill until lightly oil.
the grill just for some vegetable oil, and i 've got out beef patties here.
and i 'm just going to lay them straight on, and guys.
you want to cook these for about three minutes, each side.
there wo n't take too long, but you do want those nice char marks on each side.
so only about three minutes on each side, but definitely make sure they 're cooked all the way through so you can see there.
guys those char marks on the burger patties.
that 's what you 're looking for when you 're grilling them.
oricon sale, whopper, patties are ready to rock and roll, so let 's assemble this bad boy up.
so guys what we 've got here is a system EC band that i 've just cut in half and i have toasted and the gorilla may just focusing on the hill for the second.

i 'm just going to place it onto the heel.
and on top of that i 'm going to put on some pickles.
then i 'm going to be adding some tomato ketchup on top of the ketchup.
we 're going to be putting on some onion now, what i did to the onion.
i just cut a slice and i 've taken out the rings just like that, and just place them on the top.
if we just swap around and we 're going to start concentrating on the crown.
i 've got some mayonnaise here and i 'm just going to grab some of the mayonnaise put it on the crown and just swelling around the edges and.
next up got some lettuce that i 've just shredded.
i 'm going to place that on top of the mayor, and finally we 're going to play some, some tomatoes.
