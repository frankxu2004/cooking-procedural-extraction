hi guys remember last week when shareable car came on.
and we made that delicious healthy food.
well , if you want more healthy food, stay tuned because her series eat clean, is starting right now?
what 's clean eating anyway, it means eating whole unprocessed foods so you 'll maximize your energean optimize your health.
i 'm shareable car hosted eat clean.
join me, as i create simple healthy, delicious, homemade meals that will inspire you to eat clean and feel your best soup for breakfast.
unusual , but in many asian countries like japan and vietnam and china that 's the way the day get started, and this vegetable meso soup has everything you need to power through your day.
we have chickpeas for protein.
so for pro biotic kick.
let 's get cooking to get started heat a medium pot over medium heat, then add a couple tablespoons of olive oil and then we 're going to start with our mirror pod.
this is that delicious blend of half a chopped onion two cloves of garlic, two stocks of celery chopped and two carrots chopped.
and just cook this until the vegetables have softened, and they smell really wonderful.
now i always like season a little bit as i 'm going, and i find that this just helps build the flavor, now what are the reasons.
i love the idea of breakfast soup, is that i often run into a breakfast rut, you know, you can only have yogurt and granola or toast and eggs.
so many days in a row.
and this is just a nice way to freshen up your routine is.
also , a great way to get your vegetables in the morning.
my vegetables are sizzling away.
here they smell wonderful, one cup of cooked chickpeas and one cup of chopped broccoli cook this for just a couple of minutes, the broccoli will turn bright green smells great and add four cups of water.
the great thing that i love about a homemade soup is that you know, everything that 's going in there these are all whole ingredients and then just increase the heat to high you want to bring this picture to a boil so, i 'm just going to let this soup simmer away for about ten minutes until the broccoli is knife tender.
we do n't want to cook it too much by vegetables are perfectly cooked now.
it 's time to add the visa when you 're adding me, so too, hot.
liquid , you want to make sure that they 're not boiling.
so i 'm taking two tablespoons of me.
so two tablespoons of water and just whiskey and whisk it until it becomes saw fit this also helps incorporated into your dish a lot faster.
so me so is a fermented product, and that means there 's lots of beneficial microorganisms, and you do n't want to blast them with lots of high heat, and that 's why we 're tempering it into our soup after its summer and one of the reasons i love using me.
so not just in soup.
but another cooking is that it 's really nutrient dense.
you have lots of probiotics and it 's full of amino acid and another really important thing when you 're cooking with me.
so is to taste before you season with salt because me so is naturally high in sodium so you really only need just a little bit of salt.
hey , let 's eat this practice files.
so good so delicious healthy breakfast is a guaranteed way to have an energetic morning.
