and everybody and welcome to wolfpit OK today we 're going to make some traditional buffalo wings what we 're going to do is start off, it 's about two thirds stick of butter about a teaspoon of granulated garlic about a teaspoon of worcester shire sauce and about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, the original recipe calls for white vinegar.
i do n't necessarily like white vinegar.
so i 'm just gonna use apple cider vinegar.
and then we 're going to pour in.
some , some hot sauce.
i would say about a cup of hot sauce.
sorry , we got it 's awesome stove going to give this a mix basically all young, this is melted butter, and once it comes out to boil we 're done right there.
we got our sauces up to the ball and go ahead and remove it from the heat and start for our wings alright.
we got our oil hot and ready, and we 're going to go ahead and start frying up the chicken wings.
hi , there we go are chicken wings are off right up there, going to go ahead and pour sauce all over the top of these drizzled over and they want awesome in it yeah, all right.
now are buffalo wings.
are all dressed up in the other salary in our homemade blue cheese, dressing, and i think i 'm gonna try to blue cheese?
first story goes off here is blue cheese and mayonnaise about equal parts.
give this troffers, i love blue cheese?
all right, i was pretty tasty.
alright so now we 're going to dive in and grab a wing here so let 's give it a try.
i 've had to anchor bar sauce before, and this is, this is really close.
try it with a little bit of the blue cheese in it.
that 's pretty tasty.
she can tell this is real thick blue cheese, too well, let me give it one more try here just to make sure these days right nice and tender crisp, perfect flavor.
sometimes it 's nice just to keep things simple.
like , like we did, tonight and stick with the tradition and these are really good wings.
so , thank you guys very much for watching and go ahead and finish it this wing.
