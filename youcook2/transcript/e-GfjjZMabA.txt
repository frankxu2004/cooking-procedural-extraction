well , since winning masterchef adam lee or has become one of australia 's favorite shifts, and he was recently in malaysia, where he was born and reveal the secrets of making a traditional lexa to our reporter natalie oliveri.
let 's have a look malaysian cuisine reflects its many cultural influences, flavors, ingredients and cooking techniques and derived mainly from india china in thailand.
most popular dishes is locks are a spicy noodle soup and today.
i 'm lucky enough to be in the beautiful lake gardens in kuala lumper with master.
chef adam lee al, who 's going to show me how to cook a traditional lux are so we 're doing what we 're calling.
i carry luxa or a coconut lexer and malaysia.
thirty , different varieties of lux are there 's an ass son.
lux , which are very sort of sauron, fishy, laxer from around the neck.
but this one is the last thing we all know and love, you know, made with coconut milk in that kind of thing, a lot of malaysian cuisine starts with a paste and the luxor paste.
we 're making today is made with dried chilies.
fresh chillies, ginger garlic, diced onions fresh two meric and a mixture of asian herbs and spices.
now a lot of families would sort of hesitated making their own pace.
but you said before that it 's the easiest thing absolutely.
it 's so easy.
all it is, is putting a bunch of ingredients into a food processor or blender and blitzing them up, and then you 've got enough paste.
the last few months and months they store amazing in the freezer and.
so i think there 's nothing wrong with using a store bought paste.
but if you want to try something different it 's really nice to get out there and actually make your own post.
next we cook the paste.
in an oiled, wok, what you want when you add oil to a walk is to see that kind of sheen on the surface of the oil that tells you the oils come up to heat.
so we 're not quite there with this one yet.
but when you start to see movement on the top of your oil in a wok it 's probably going to be tonight once the walk is heated.
we , at the luxor paste and why do you cook the paste like this does n't bring out the flavor.
does we 're using it, uses so many fragrant ingredients and you really need to cook the flavor to bring out, bring out the flavor of those for ingredients.
you cook them really, well, in this kind of post after about ten to fifteen minutes when the oil separates, and the color of the paste darkens, it 's cooked we then add coconut milk and chicken stock along with tofu puffs, prawns, and squid little bit of our rational, and you can see that, that came dryden to get it from the dried to sort of ready for the pot consistency.
all we do is just suck that in a little bit of hot water for about ten minutes and then strain it.
and then, you know, i was like chicken in my lexus.
so a little bit of shredded chicken as well, adam, then, shocks and springs of vietnamese meant to garnish, and the luxor was been ready to plate up.
you can see that the trim req that you 've used, yeah, it 's got their beautifully vibrant yellow color, you get there.
you get there not.
so yummy, really, really tasty, after the luxa adam is taking me for a stroll through the streets of kuala lumper, and we end up at a traditional street store, serving tea.
taric or korte.
after i take it 's time to take a tour through a sweet factory in one of kuala lumper 's back streets.
adam , what is this place so this is a running on your quasar factory that hand makes a lot of the traditional play the malaysian desserts?
and they do it every single variety, here.
i mean, almost all of them anyway, and we can definitely have a look at what they 're doing here.
we can definitely taste like coconuts are a staple of malaysian scene and a processed freshly in the factory to use in their play desserts.
so madly in this part of the factory that look up cream, and, you know, the fresh coconut cream is.
so different from what you buy in a can or, or powder.
that kind of day.
you see, they got all these coconuts splitting in half and then grading them all on these little coconut grinders and then all of this coconut here just gets pressed and that 's how you extract the coat factory more focused builds takes over, well, most of the sweets are made by hand here, there is one encrusting machine, which fills the kuebel 's, and mold them into neat little cakes i was also surprised to learn that despite the bright colors of the cakes there actually naturally colored the blueish purple pull it tie is colored with flowers, which are boiled while the green play uses be intense use of camden leaves.
but through the quite taste as good as they look.
so yummy, i know why i believe those all day i 'll visit to malaysia with thanks to malaysia kitchen for authentic recipes and to find your local restaurants visit malaysia kitchen dot com dot AU.
