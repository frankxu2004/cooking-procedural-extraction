everyone is J L crow here at the aimless cook happy new year, hope you 're having a great year so far.
and i hope you had a fun and safe holiday today on the aimless cook.
we 're going to be making a japanese noodle bowl called zucchini troodon now, zucchini means moon viewing.
and it 's named that because of the egg that we 're going to add at the end resembles the moon.
it 's a really easy soup base that we 've done before, but i 'm gonna show, you, with some new ingredients, how to put this together.
it 's really easy to do.
and i 'm going to show you how to do it right.
now on the aimless code, so.
let 's start with their soup based by combining in a small bowl, two tablespoons of brown sugar with three tablespoons, each of soy sauce and mirin.
now we 're going to take two thirds of that mixture and put it into a saucepan where we 're just going to heat it up and simmer until everything is dissolved in combine.
finally , to that 's way mixture.
we 're going to add two and a half cups of dashie now.
we 're just going to mix that together again bring it to a simmer and then let 's move on over here on the cutting board.
i got a bunch of nice fresh oyster mushrooms and what i 'm going to do is, i 'm just going to cut the bottom off of this.
so i can hand shred them to manageable pieces and then i 'm going to add them to a frying pan with some butter.
two tablespoons of butter on high heat in a saute them for a few minutes until they are fragrant and golden brown.
now too, that i 'm going to add the remaining soy mixture from the bowl from earlier and i 'm going to continue cooking until that mixture thickens and we met thickens up i 'm just going to take them off the heat.
hi , in another large pot at a rolling boil here, i got some boudin noodles and i 'm just going to cook them.
according to the directions until they are done.
it usually takes about three or four minutes.
now i got some lemons and what i 'm going to do here is, i 'm just going to lightly and very carefully shave the zest.
i need a piece about as big as a fingernail.
and i 'm going to use one piece in each serving to add a little more depth to the flavor.
and you 're going to notice it, trust me now before i assemble.
i 'm just going to add about six snow peas to my simmering broth, and i 'm just going to briefly cook them for about sixty seconds to assemble.
i 'm going to start by putting a piece of lemon, zest from the bottom of each bowl, followed by the strained boudin noodles.
i 'm going to follow that with some soup stock and then top with the snow peas mushroom and then finally the egg.
now you can use a raw egg or in this case i use some onsen, tamago now, if you want the recipe for onsen , tamago.
