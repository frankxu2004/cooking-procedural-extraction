hey guys day from cooking chair here today 's recipe is perogy 's these tasty little devils originated in eastern and central europe were in no way claiming to be authentic.
so , let 's get started.
so what about here is a large potato that i boiled up and we 're going to combine this with half a cup of grated cheddar cheese, of course, you can use your favorite cheese.
a tablespoon of bacon bits if you want to use, real chopped up bacon.
that 's fine as well quarter teaspoon of granulated garlic, then we 're going to throw in a couple of tablespoons of milk, a quarter teaspoon of salt and last.
but not least a quarter teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper.
now i 'm just going to grab my potato masher here an mash this up until everything is really nicely combined.
now are filling is done ready to begin making a perogy, rappers.
and i 'm going to begin by adding two cups of all purpose flour to a bowl crack in a couple of eggs and two thirds of a cup of lukewarm water.
i 'm just going to grab my spoon here and just kind of mix things up.
you 're probably going to want to change your hands later just to get a good consistency in a good mixture.
we 're going to work this until you get a nice ball perogy, dough something like this.
OK , what you want to do.
now is flower a surface.
but this does a little bit on the wet sticky side.
so you might want to add a generous amount of flour and also flower your rolling pin.
now we 're just going to lay the dough on and cut it in half.
just so we have two workable portions grab the rolling pin, and we 're going to roll this out until it.
so i 'd say somewhere in the neighborhood of about an eighth of an inch thick now, i 'm going to grab adele, cutter here, and this is just something i 'd kicking around in the cupboard.
but of course, do n't throw it out.
because you 're going to make more pro gay rappers out of this OK.
so what we 're going to do is scoop up about a heaping, tablespoon of the mixture put the rapper into the palm of your hand place.
the mixture into the center of the rapper press, it down fold it over and then just kind of seal.
it shot after that what i 'm going to do is just take a.
fork , and kind of push down on it, well.
this is going to do a couple of things.
number one is going to steal it, shot and is going to make a nice fancy design.
all right what you want to do.
now is bring a pot of water to a nice rolling, boil throw the perogies in and let them cook until they begin to float.
and this will take somewhere in the neighborhood of about all, i 'd say four minutes of course, you 're going to want to do these in batches of about four to five.

so we 're just going to set this aside on a plate, and you 're going to repeat this process for the rest of the perogies.
lastly , what we 're going to do.
is add a bit of olive oil to appreciate a pin put the perogies in and we 're going to try.
this , over medium high heat, i 'd say for about two and a half minutes on each side.
just so there.
