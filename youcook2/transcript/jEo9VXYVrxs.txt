below this is chef john from food wishes, dot com with macaroni salad that 's right.
i cannot believe this many summers have come and gone.
and i have not shared my take on this iconic summer side dish, i mean, i shudder to think what you been using instead no fence, so, i apologize for the delay.
but hopefully after you see and taste how awesome this comes out all will be forgiven.
so let 's go ahead and get started with the dressing and one of the keys to a great macaroni salad is to do the dressing first for reasons.
i 'll explain in a second start with some mayonnaise and of course, we 're going to use real full fat mayonnaise, and to the mayonnaise will add a couple spoons of dijon mustard to be honest, yellow mustard seems to be more traditional.
but i really do like the dijon better here.
so a little bit of mustard and then we 're also going to need some vinegar, and for this, i 'm recommending plain white distilled vinegar, and it 's not like you 're going to wreck this using a different vinegar.
but really this is just in here for the acidity, and i think we want something that has a neutral flavor, and then will need to season this up a little bit with the shaker, cayenne pepper, as well, as some freshly ground, black pepper and of course, some salt and we 'll take a whiskey will mix that up.
and , that is basically the base of the dressing for this macaroni salad, except for one key crucial and controversial ingredient sugar.
so while it is true that your classic american deli style macaroni salad does use sort of a sweet dressing, i find that the most popular recipes out there call for way, way too much like a half a cup or two thirds of a cup of sugar.
so i 'm only going to call for one or two tablespoons, which i think provides plenty of sweetness, especially since we 're going to have lots of sweet vegetables and once that 's all mixed, together the liquid portion of our dressings done, and we have to move on to the solids also known as our dice.
veggies so we 'll start with a whole bunch of.
finely , diced, celery as well as some grated carrot want a little bit of onion.
in this, and i 'm going to use the white and light green parts of some scallions.
but just regular onion will work fine and then for color sweetness and a little bitterness.
we 're definitely going to do some pepper, and i 'm going to do several kinds.
i 'm going to get some red bell pepper and then also some green pepper in the form of poblano and jalapeno and then we 'll take a spatula will make this up and i really think it 's important.
we do this step before we cook our pasta OK because these vegetables are almost going to get like a quick pickling in this dressing.
OK , the salt to sugar the acid is going to pull liquid out of those vegetables to firm up and crisp up the texture.
and i really do think it makes a little bit of a difference and besides, no one can really prove otherwise.
and once S mix will just pop it in the fridge, while we prepare macaroni, and i 'm just going to leave that spatula right in there.
because we are going to use that to mix the salad up.
so will pop that in the fridge and move on to our elbow.
macaroni so what we have here is one pound of elbow macaroni.
that 's about four cups and we 're going to cook this in some generously salted boiling water.
and i said cook, not under cook were going to cook this all the way, just like as if we were going to eat this hot, any idea who came up with the notion that you 're supposed to under cook pasta for a salad.
but it 's just not true unless you want a horrible gummy texture macaroni salad, i mean, who knows.
maybe you do.
but , assuming you wanted an enjoyable texture.
i recommend cooking at the full time at which point we 're going to drain that very, very well, so.
let 's pour that into a calendar to let it drain.
and do not under any circumstances rents, this pasta for this particular salad that is, the biggest mistake you could make.
so do n't do it, just let this sit and rain for about five minutes, and every.
i want you to give it the old shaker, shaker which is going to help knock off some of that water and once more convinced are macaroni is.
very , very well, drained.
we will transfer that into a large mixing bowl and proceed.
probably , the most important step in this whole process.
the tossing and cooling of the macaroni.
what we 'll do is we 'll take our special from the dressing.
thus , his macaroni, occasionally until it cools down to just about room temp and while we 're using a spatula from the dressing we 're definitely not going to add any dressing until this has cooled down right if you had a mayonnaise based dressing to hot macaroni, which will end up with, is a very greasy macaroni salad?
and what 's going to happen here.
is you 're tossing and cooling a very fine layer starts?
is going to form on each one of those pieces of macaroni and that thin layer starts has been proven to more effectively?
grab on and hold on to that mayonnaise based dressing.
they 've done studies the male clinic.
but anyway, like i said, we want to cool that down to about room temperature, and if everything is gone, according to plan those pieces of macaroni should just be tacky enough to stick to your hand.
so that 's perfect right there and yes, i will stop touching the macaroni.
now and at this point finally, we can go ahead and add are dressing and is your mic, sinus if you 're thinking man, this is way too much dressing seems kind of wet do n't worry.
because you prep your macaroni properly by the time this is ready to serve it 's going to be fully and perfectly, absorbed trust me and by the way, we 're not going to taste it at this point OK we want to see this until that macaroni has fully absorb the dressing and it 's at the temperature going to serve it, so, what will do, is will rap it up and will pop it in the fridge for at least four hours.
but overnight is best which is how long i left mine in the fridge and then the.
next day, when we pull it out, it should look something like this, and as predicted all addressing has been perfectly absorbed and what i 'd like to do at this point is take the special and give it a nice mix.
so we can really see what we have, and, while you can definitely serve it like this i generally like to freshen it up a little bit with another small pseudo mayonnaise and just a little touch of cold water just like a tablespoon or two just drizzle it in and will give that a mix and, well, that 's really not going to significantly change the characteristics of the salad, it is, like i said going to give it a little bit of a pressure look.
so you decide you were there tony, tony, tony of your macaroni.
so that kind of steps up to you and once our salad has been tossed and freshened up the last and most important step we have to taste for seasoning.
so i gave my new taste and it was perfect, and at that point will transfer it to some kind of serving container and by the way.
because this salad is.
so naturally beautiful and fresh, looking it does not need any garnish unless of course, you want people to share it on social media, which in that case, you better stop it with some green onions you think it was going to pin this with no garnish on top.
i do n't think so, so i did a little green onion for the final touch, and that 's it might take on the classic.
all american macaroni salad is done and i realized taste is subjective.
but for me, this is just the epitome of the classic american macaroni salad, not too sweet, which is the right level of acidity in a very generous amount of vegetables as well as a beautiful, silky, creamy, mouthfeel.
because we did n't dress at macaroni hot.
but anyway, that 's it.
my version of the classic american macaroni salad, and of course, this is going to pair beautifully with anything.
barbecue , grill or smoke.
this summer i probably should 've done that in a different order, but anyway, the point is.
i really hope you give this a try soon.
