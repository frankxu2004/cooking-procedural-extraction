so it starts off with some lime, juice.
i 'm going to roll these on the board just to make sure i get all the juice loose in the limes and squeeze them straight into a bowl.
we 're going to balance this out with some sweetness.
i 've got two tablespoons of caster sugar going in here.
and you want to mix it through just until it 's completely dissolved, and now it 's time to add in some fish sauce looking for about two tablespoons.
if you 're worried about it tasting like fish.
it absolutely does n't.
it imparts a wonderful salty flavor and a really subtle aroma, give that a mix through i 'm going to order it down.
because we 're adding lots of herbs in here as well.
so just about a tablespoon of some water going in and now.
it 's time to get in there with some key flavors.
so i 've got some garlic.
i 've got some red chili.
and now my herbs i 've got some coriander.
and i 've got some vietnamese hot mint.
so just tear off some of those leaves and give it all a good fine chop for a super head of that freshness that goes straight into this dipping sauce, given a good stir through.
so i 'm going to serve this up with some summer rolls, which are very easy to make.
i have some rice paper sheets, which have been soaking in some water and now, it 's time to fill it with lots of fresh and crunchy ingredients.
so i 'm going to start off with some prawns.
and then top it up with some.
cucumber , a little bit of carrots and some spring onions to bump up that fresh flavor.
i 've got a combination of herbs.
i 've got sawtooth, coriander.
i 've got vietnamese hot mint and some coriander, as well, and now all that stuff to do is talk it up to bed.
try and rap this up as tightly as possible and there you have a beautiful and very simple little summer roll filled with lots of fresh ingredients and the perfect complement to my wonderful herbie, dipping sauce.
