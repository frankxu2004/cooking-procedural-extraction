if you have n't already click that button and subscribe to our channel on the menu today would be making a lamb and potato curry or masallah as you can see.
i 've got my pan, he ran in there.
i 've got some oil that 's eating up nicely.
i 'm using the sunflower oil.
go ahead and use any oil, you like we 're going to drop in some whole seeds or girl messila, so here they got.
we wanted to rose from pop and crackle is a favorite.
yeah , i 've got in there some fennel seeds.
human says green car doing flat must 've seats.
that 's what i 'm using today for this.
they 're going to release a wonderful flavor into the oil now.
i 'm going to go home with ground lamb.
we 're going to fire this for about five or six minutes, just with the whole gallon.
masila give me love.
can you finish if you want so let 's just cook this?
let 's say for about five or six minutes, turn it over.
i 'm gonna kind of above medium heat was the seal.
it a little bit, and then we 're going to add, of course, lots of other lovely spices you can see the armies is browning really nicely.
i mean, it is no any occultum.
that 's what we 've got to do now is to get this meet.
nice and tender, well, i do here.
is i 'm going to add some garlic ginger paste?
it 's a fifty, fifty mix of garlic, and ginger is about three of these little teaspoons in there.
you 're going to add some chopped onions.
i 'm using a red onion, but go ahead and use dwight 's, so we 're going to add some challenges as always.
if you 've watched the channel i call this the big for their equal parts of chili coriander cumin and turmeric.
if you like, of course, you can use your favorite color is harder.
we 're going to add some sort at this stage.
let 's just get this over and again.
we 're going to just cook this rope out now three or four minutes turning it constantly again on a kind of above medium.
he 's because of lovely flavors happening now.
now we 're going to do is add some water that was cold water by the way, you know, which is sort of covering it a little bit, you know, we 're going to bring this water to the boil and then we 're going to simmer this, we have a little for about fifteen minutes.
this is the part that i hope generally works or tenderize army to make it nice and soft.
so , let 's take a look now.
so that 's the mail there just cooking them beautifully.
and as you can see look at that.
the meat comes trail off of that bone.
certainly , on its way now, pretty essential part of doing this dish is to get your meat.
nice and ten dollars, you end up with an awful, awful tough meat.
no matter what cut you user, maybe but really, expensive land.
it would still end up being tough if you do n't go through this process.
i 'm not going to add some potatoes which are peeled and shot there 's a fairly small you cut them.
however , you like and the cooking process.
promise you take the longer time if you put them in much bigger.
so again let 's give this a mix.
stir them in when you still got a decent amount of moisture in there from that water if you have n't at this point, maybe it 's got really dry, add a bit more water.
now it 's gonna go back on, and we 're going to put this for about seven to eight minutes on a fairly low heat, not a simmer above a simmer OK.
let 's jump in now take a look alice.
looking more like it.
potatoes are cooking very nicely.
i kinda, like my potatoes quite softap.
i 'm now at this stage going to add some chopped tomatoes.
i 'm just going to spread them on the top.
i put the lid back on, on a fairly low heat were going to cook them just for about five minutes.
what they should do is breakdown with this team.
that 's there to make the moment.
this team will greatly there.
we 're going to mix it around, once we come back.
we may add a little tad more water perhaps and then we 're pretty much done.
we should be now at the final status.
they could look, yeah.
these are suffering really nicely as you can see.
and they 've given off a little bit of moisture, as well.
it 's not certain it 's over at this stage element.
add some fresh chili is certainly optional as to how much you put in a full in about four five there, you know, need to check this for salt?
it 's all good for maine, you can.
if you want finish up with some fresh coriander or cilantro, let 's just keep that for about two more minutes.
and it 's done.
i 'm really happy with it.
i see you again soon.
take care, bye, bye.
