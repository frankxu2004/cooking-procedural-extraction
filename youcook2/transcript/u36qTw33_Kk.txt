faces good afternoon from creative cooking corner.
this is matt.
and there 's been a little bit of excitement around the kitchen and house.
but the company i bought it from, is a very reputable open farm up in upstate new york called hudson valley.
but i highly recommend if you 've never had faux gras, you really need to try it at least once.
because it 's the most unbelievable it 's not good for you at all it 's pure fat.
so good right.
so here we go with our fatted duck, liver this is a moulard duck it 's a certain breed of duck that they bred especially for making for grass.
so i unwrapped are duck liver put it here on a cutting board and i will show you how to cut it.
so what you want to do is take a knife sharp knife keep it in hot water for a few minutes to get it hot, the blade hot remember this is fatted liver.
so it 's very it 's ninety nine percent fat and what i 'm going to do.
is i 'm not going to use this whole thing.
today , i 'm actually going to refreeze part of this.
so we can save it as a treat for later.
but i 'm going to cut probably four slices off here for our meal.
so the thing is, you want to try and get him the same thickness.
and you see how that cut just like that, that 's beautiful tip.
your knife, back in the hot water for a few seconds, wipe it off, got another slice.
it 's kind of like cutting cold butter, and the reason you heat your knife is with a cold knife.
it would just kind of tear it, and it 's not very it does n't cut it very nice.
so i 'm going to season the duck liver here with a little fresh ground.
black pepper and fine sea salt just as frankly not alot, part of the recipe is going to be one apple, this is a fuji very good flavor.
so i like him alot.
they 're probably my favorite.
i 'm going to peel it, and cowritten slice it and i will karma lies it and serve it with the faux gras.
i 've got a nonstick, skillet.
my fog raw my apples that i sliced up some honey, some sugar, and some konyak and by the way, let 's cover this.
i bought french loaf from the bakery earlier today, and i happen to have my grill.
so , i brushed this bread with olive oil little bit of salt and pepper on both sides.
and i lightly grilled it.
that 's what i 'll be put in a full grown with apples as my serving, you need to preheat your pan.
medium high heat.
it 's be hot.
you gotta remember this is.
fact , if you leave it in the pan, too, long it 's all going to melt.
so you want to charge the outside or saute in this case as quickly as possible, so you get a nice crunch on the outside.
nice beautiful pink color on the inside, you can see immediately, it starts making its own oil.
but they get nice and steered on one side, turn the heat down maybe a little bit to that nice char.
that 's what you 're looking for so.
we 're going to use that fat.
i 'm going to put the apples in there with some sugar, and caramel, ISM and will serve that together on the bread, with a little bit of this awesome going to make.
and you can see done, i took it off the heat.
it does n't take long, i mean, total cooking time might have been, what a minute.
but you can see how beautiful it is all right now.
it 's quite a bit of fat.
so what i 'm going to do is probably take a little bit of that, out of there.
so there might be two tablespoons of fat left in the pan there.
i 'm going to sprinkle some sugar in here turn the heat up again.
take some apple slices.
and we 're going to caramelizing.
we 're going to sprinkle the top with a little more sugar.
is sugar helps carmelite smells wonderful in here between the bogue?
RA and the apples were going to lick the apples over you can see there turning a nice light brown that 's about perfect.
all that 's left after i 'd.
is i 'm going to, pour in a little bit of konyak and flame it off?
you do n't have to do this if you do n't want to you can just pour it in.
and it 'll vapur ate the.
alcohol , this is just for show, but it 's kind of fun.
and my wife likes it so heat this up.
take it off the heat for the koniak.
in it 's going to splatter take your.
lighter , there you go look at that it 's all done over, turn your heat off toss, this around.
a little bit, take your program going to pour it right over the top of the full graw, and then i 'll show you how to play it.
so i have one of my little, i guess you could call it a crostini, just that french bread that i brushed in grill.
take your full graw with apples and just look at a, you know, what this NP.
so probably fit this piece perfectly.
so pick it up, put it on their kind of mash.
it down a little bit and what you want to do is maybe put an apple or two on top of there, like that, and then the sauce it 's on the plate, which is a lot of fat and some good flavor.
just drizzle a little bit on top.
just a simple presentation.
i really do n't like to cloud up the flavor of the folder.
i really like it.
so i like to keep it very easy.
so , let 's go ahead and do the final thing.
let 's give this a try.
it 's going to be fantastic.
you really just need to splurge and try this even if you do n't cook it at home go find a nice restaurant and try it, it 's phenomenal alright.
so what i need from you guys is.
we 've decided to write a cookbook.
