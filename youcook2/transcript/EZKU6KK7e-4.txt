hey guys welcome back to the sunday project, with me, jacqueline.
tonight we 're cooking up some bibimbap vegetarian bibimbap.
this recipe calls for a lot of prep.
nothing too crazy, just a lot of shopping.
so get the troops together and have a fun night in making this yummy meal before we get cooking chop up some cucumber carrot mushroom and radish into thin ish sticks.
make them all roughly the same size.
then chop up some tofu into cubes now.
let 's marinate your tofu in some sesame E oil.
ginger and lemon juice as usual all the ingredients will be in my website, the sunday project dot net, then marinade, the cucumber an apple cider vinegar water, honey chili flakes and salt.
now for the assembly.
after all that prep, this is the easy part.
if you have some hot pot bowls for bibimbap, use those if not a regular pop works just fine place.
you 're hot pot over the stove and phil at two thirds of the way up with rice were using leftover brown rice.
but you can easily use whatever you have on hand, then bring some water to a boil, an quickly boiled the carrots.
this part is optional.
you could really just throw all these in roann, it would still taste delicious distribute the carrots into your hot pots.
they have some lettuce and again distribute and then do the same for your radishes now.
fry up your mushrooms.
i told you this part was easy.
throw in some chopped mangoes for sweetness and kim chi for spice and then comes the marinated tofu.
and cucumbers do n't waste that yummy gingery juice, either throw that right in and to top it all off fry up an egg and slap that, on sprinkle, some, sesame E seeds on top and if you like it really hot, do n't forget the gochujang if going veggie is n't your thing you can easily add some thin slices of lightly fried pork to this and it would still work really well.
but i promise you this dish is.
so flavorful and, filling you really would n't miss the meat.
now after all your hard work shopping and throwing things into your hot pot it 's time to dig in and enjoy.
