i 'm here with my friends from failed dietze dot com and today were making a holiday classic.
the waldorf salad, and i 'm actually going to make a chicken waldorf sound because this is something i plan to have for dinner tonight.
so i want to add a little bit more to it.
but this is a good one to make for your holiday table for that big dinner, or to actually make for a brunch 'cause it really hits all those nodes.
it hit the sweet.
the savory it 's crunchy and super easy.
the only thing we 're going to use in the oven for us, so let 's get started.
so right now i 'm just going to be prepping my vegetables and my fruit just have some grapes right here.
some red seedless grapes that i 'm just going to cut in half an as i 'm going, i 'm just tossing them into my salad bowl.
lamb chop, it up to celery, now i 'm just gonna dice up some apples now that i have my apple in the bowl.
i 'm going to go ahead and squeeze some lemon over it.
and this just going to prevent, prevent it from browning.
i 'm also chopping up some dried cranberry so talks in the salad, and this is just going to add a nice sweetness.
and also a tanky, sourness i have a skillet set it by medium heat.
i 'm just going to toss in some walnuts and get them toasted up basically when you start smelling them.
that 's when they 're done you want to keep a close eye on them 'cause you do n't want them to burn alright.
let 's see if i can flip them like all those professional chefs do hopefully, hopefully.
we do n't all end up on the floor that was close.
i 'm going to give myself a couple of points for that OK, i think that game and take them off.
the heat right here 's our toasted walnuts just going to give him a rough chap.
i 'm not going to toss them in the salad red awake.
so i want them to get soggy.
but i do it just want to get them chapter out of the way right.
now on to the dressing right.
now in my measuring cup.
i have some greek yogurt.
and i 'm going to put in some light meanings and nick, this.
together i 'm going to add some agave a nectar.
this another maps, i 'm also going to put in a little bit of cracked, black pepper give us another little mix around, give it a taste.
so this is good.
all right, let 's start assembling our salad.
even go with the chicken.
and i 'm going to put couple of daleks of this dressing on an mix.
this , around wanna, get all the flavors incorporated.
this is so good guys.
it 's crunchy tangy.
so glad, we did n't go overboard on the dress because you can definitely taste the individual ingredients that we have on here in here perfectly.
this is so good and then look at those colors.
you got the red from the grapes.
it 's like the perfect holiday salad.
so if you, if this is something that 's familiar to your holiday table go ahead and give this version a try i guarantee your family is not going to notice the difference.
and if you have n't tried it, go ahead and try it out your family is going to be pleasantly surprised, so, that is basically it.
