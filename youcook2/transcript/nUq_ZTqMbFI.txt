hi , everybody, this is valentina from the real italian kitchen and today.
we are going to make carbonara.
so the first thing i did for carbonara was to put large part of water on the stove to boil, the pasta, then i 'm going to use is spaghetti key by the check.
and they need to cook in abundant boiling water, while that happens.
i prepare i grate the cheese that i 'm going to use which is going to be half.
parmigiano , regina lan half piccolino, romano.
and i 'm going to cut my main ingredient of carbonara, which is, well, actually it 's one charlie.
but we ca n't get it here.
so i 'm using fun cheetah that i bought on supermarket italy dot com, you can find, a detailed list of the ingredients in the more info area below the video.
so let 's cut it.
i 've never tried this.
i 'm really curious.
it 's vacuum sealed and what i want to do is just cut, cut into little cubes warming up the non stick, pan, and i 'm just going to throw the pancetta in it.
and i 'm going to let it sizzle.
let it brown.
and it 's going to create its own oil zone fat.
so i 'm not going to add any go back to the grating cheese, cooking time for the spaghetti is nine minutes.
i 'm going to cook it for seven minutes, and then check it and see if it 's all dente, which is the way i like it, are punch, it, that is definitely ready look at how golden brown, and it became it 's nice, and chris speed going to turn the fire off and just let it sit there for a second until my spaghetti and my eggs are ready break.
the egg in a bowl and then whip it with a fork.
one thing you can do to make sure that the egg is not too runny in the pasta is to pull the eggs out of the fridge earlier.
so that it 's not fridge called and warm it up.
in some warm water, and i also warmed up the glass bowl with warm water as well, so that it does n't.
it 's not cools down the past when we throw it in there, strain the pasta.
make sure there is no extra water in it, an just mix it in with the egg say beautiful.
the parmigiano mixed with the pecorino.
a lot of it and the pancetta with all it 's beautiful.
natural fact, this is for two people.
an i used approximately a hundred and fifty grams of pasta, which is a force of the box there it is it 's done, served with some more probably johno or piccolino on top and if you like it, and you can have it some pepper it 's delicious on top of it at lamar to sue.
a , how they say it in rome, and i hope you enjoy hope you try it, thank you for following the real italian kitchen cachao.
