now i want to teach you so, please enjoy my video tutorials on how to make western style, sushi rating comment, and enjoy the sushi to start offering the california.
we 're going to start with a half a sheet of nori and prepared rice.
now you can either add toasted sesame E seeds on here.
another topping you can do for the california roll is the masago or the fish eggs, adds a nice flavor.
i would say the toasted sesame E seeds, a little more traditional, this definitely adds a different unique twist to the role hurry.
now we 're ready to fill the role, so here we have the crab sticks.
imitation crab sticks next thing we 're going to add is a cucumber and then of course, the avocado right then, we 're just going to roll it over.
get to fill in their press, it down, roll it over to seal it precedential more time.
now i use a wet xrated knife to cut these for.
she cut in half than half again and then those pieces in half you get a pieces parole and there you have the california roll, which started my love for sushi in joy.
