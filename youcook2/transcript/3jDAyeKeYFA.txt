getting the folks, it 's glenn, the ball shelf in this evening.
we 're going to be putting together a appetizer recipe for calamari, and this is just fried squid, ringlets.
it 's pretty easy to put together, and i 'm going to show you the step by step instructions on how to do just.
so if you 're going to make calamari, what you 're going to do is get fresh squid, wild card, do n't buy the ring?
let go ahead and get the squid take the tentacles off.
remove the little spiny piece of cartilage, it 's inside the squid of the innards.
and i 've done that with these squid try to get the smallest squids possible because they 're the tasty so what we 're going to do is.
after you clean these, these pieces of squid out you 're just going to cut these into, into, into ringlets.
it 's real simple and one thing to keep in mind is that you 're going to want to cut these into about half inch slices.
i 'm going to go ahead and prepare all of these pieces of squid.
i 've got and i 'll take you to the next step.
i have now cleaned all of my squid up.
cut it up.
and i 've got it on a paper towel, drawing at i have taken three quarters of a cup of just all purpose flour and a quarter cup of cornmeal.
i 'm going to add one egg to that.
then we 're going to place three quarters of a cup of warm water into this mixture.
now i 'm going to stir this up into a batter.
and when i 've done such i 'll come back and show you.
the next step OK now that i have prepared my batter.
it 's going to be pretty liquidity that 's OK, we 're going to put all of the squid into the batter first.
and once we have the squid immersed into the unseasoned batter give it a little bit of a stir.
and we 'll set that aside, and i 'll show you the next step.
the next step in this battering process is we 're going to put in one cup of panko bread crumbs.
is there japanese bread crumbs that are mace light and fluffy?
but that right into this bowl and to that, i 'm going to add one and a quarter tablespoon of cayenne pepper.
i want these spicy, if he do n't like spicy do n't put the kayan pepper in there.
we 're going to add some salt just about a teaspoon or.
so the bank of flicks that i 've got do not have any salt in them.
so we do want to put a little bit of salt in there.
and the last spikes we 're going to use if i want to use about a teaspoon of white pepper and what we simply want to do.
now really mix the dry ingredients together, and then once that 's accomplished.
we 're going to read up our squid.
now , what we 're going to do is we 're going to spite her out our squid from the batter that they were sitting in and then we 're going to mix those in with the paint go bread crumbs to thoroughly coat the calamari and what we 're going to want to do.
then remove those and set those onto a paper towel and re bets.
the rest now or next step is we 're going to take and put our panko, infused, calamari into a basket.
here we 're going to shake that a little bit take off some of the extra breading and then what we 've done here is we 've taken a deep fat fryer.
we 've put in some vegetable oil that we brought up to three hundred fifty degrees.
we 're going to drop.
calamari , right into the todd oil to put the top on this.
so that it does n't splatter over everything and in about five minutes will come back diggler alright.
these in fried up nice and golden brown and go ahead and remove him from the oil and we will put them right over onto a he.
so paper towel alright folks, there is the completed calamari, appetizer recipe.
let 's give one of these little critters try here.

you could dip it in that go with a lemon.
i just wanted to see one of these tastes.
