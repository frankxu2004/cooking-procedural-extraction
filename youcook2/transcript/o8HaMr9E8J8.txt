thanks to all recipes member.
marsha , molina, who shares this recipe for sauerkraut for canning all recipes member hot, she says after making this easy to do recipe.
she 'll never use store bought sauerkraut again.
the original recipe uses fifty pounds of cabbage.
but we 've cut it down to just five pounds begin by cutting the cabbage into quarters for a twist on your sauerkraut.
try using purple cabbage instead then remove the cores and thinly cut the cabbage about the thickness of a dime.
if you prefer you can cut the cabbage using a mandoline or food processor in a large bowl later, the cabbage with three tablespoons of canning salt mix it together and set aside for five to ten minutes to wilt.
add the cabbage to a clean food safe container or pickling jar press firmly until juices come to the surface.
there is n't enough liquid to cover the cabbage.
many allrecipes members suggest making a quick brine with two cups of cold water and three force tablespoon of salt.
next cover the cabbage with cheesecloth or muslin and tuck the edges down against the inside of the container, be sure to weigh the cabbage down.
so that it is completely covered by brian, said the container at a room temperature of about seventy degrees to begin the fermentation process.
this will usually take anywhere between three to six weeks.
if you notice any scum forming be sure to remove and discard it after several weeks of fermenting, sauerkraut is ready.
if you wish you could follow the recipe directions to cannon sauerkraut or keep it refrigerated for up to a month.
