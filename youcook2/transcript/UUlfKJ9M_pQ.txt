first thing we 're going to do is cook some bacon.
i have six trips in here which i cut into pieces as you can see and just going to cook this until it 's all cooked.
we 're going to use two ten ounce cans of clams for this.
i 'm using baby clams and what i did is i just as you can see, drain them.
but i 'm going to keep the liquid that 's two hundred eighty three grams by the way, if you using bigger clamps, you are going to have to chop him, or you can just buy in minced, clams to charge labs.
i 'm also going to use clam juice for this, this is an eight ounce bottle that 's two hundred thirty six milliliters.
if you cannot find this.
you can use a cup of chicken stock.
we 're going to take the bacon out of the part now that it 's nice interest fat in there.
i 'm going to add some chopped onion to this and celery, we 're going to cook this for a few minutes until the onions are softened and translucent.
i 'm going to be using baby potatoes for this recipe.
all i did is scrub them.
i will not peel them, and i quartered them.
you can use russet potato peel.
it and chop it into pieces.
i 'm going to add some time leaves to this.
let 's call it a teaspoon.
now i 'm going to add a third cup of all purpose flour, uh, programs on the recipe for you.
we 're going to cook this for a couple minutes.
now we 're going to add are liquid the liquid from the cans in the clam juice, you know, the plungers is salty and the liquid from mccann.
also has some salt to it.
so i 'm not going to add any salt until the end will taste it and then decide if it needs more.
so i have roughly two and a half cups of liquid, and i 'm going to whisk it in and get rid of all the lumps that my form, you know, all the flowers upset might form, you know, there 's no flour lumps in here.
this is perfect.
i 'm not going to add my potatoes and most of the bacon i 'll leave some for topping.
so leave that for toppings alright.
we 're going to let this simmer for about fifteen minutes until the potatoes are tender.
do n't let this start boiling crazy?
OK make sure it 's just simmering, i want you to stir this occasionally, OK.
he 's really does a cooked.
they 're nice and tender, i can pearson with a fork that took about.
i 'm going to say maybe twenty minutes.
i 'm going to add one and a half.
cups of cream to this, and i 'm going to add the plants, so we 're just going to mix all this.
we 're going to simply heat.
this , through i 'm not going to let this boil, and it taste for salt for me.
it 's fine, i will add pepper as you can see.
i garnish this with some bacon, and.
now we 're going to eat dinner yet, uh, uh-huh, ah, yes, this is one of my favorite soups is not health food.
so i do n't eat it.
maybe once a year but boy is it good.
this is very, very, very nice.
super easy to make elegant enough to have when you have guests over, it 's also a great little weeknight dinner by the way, this bread is made by my friend, mercedez here, and she 's going to be making a video with us in a few weeks.
