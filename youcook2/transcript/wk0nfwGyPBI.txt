hi guys, thanks for joining me for part, two of the eggs, benedict recipe, we 're going to get straight on into it because i 'm hungry.
so what you 're going to need is english muffin now.
i 've made mine from scratch, i might stick up a video later on about how to do that.
but if you just got english math, and from the supermarket where it 's going to split them, toast them and stick them on a plate and we just going to lightly butter them while we 're doing this we 're cooking some strips of bacon as you can see here for your pan is on a high heat.
you do n't want to boil the bacon.
you want to try it with a little bit of oil, the fat in the bacon will render itself out.
so it will cook it, and the fat as well.
so lightly freight your bacon.
and then once that 's done, you can put it on some paper towels to get rid of the excess oil and fat and if you guys have n't checked out my a poached egg video, i would like here, you can check it out.
but basically, we just got out part of water here.
where did put in a poached eggs?
now i always do you poached eggs one at a time to in the same pot, really, do n't go along well, together.
so be patient one oregon time and then we can once that caught, we can move on to construct our eggs.
benedict breakfast, so like i said, we 've got our english muffin here, lightly buttered now when you can either put down some hyundai source.
before i buy can i have n't chosen not to.
so he 's going to put layout strips of bacon across our english muffin and then of course on top of that goes out poached eggs.
so you can have one, you can have two.
we can even have three if you really up for it.
so two weeks here and now.
finally , our harness source that we 've prepared, prepared earlier and earlier video.
now like i said, you 've just won, the sub slightly.
so we can dress this across the top of our eggs.
now put a liberal.
amount , on you do n't want to go not enough.
you do n't want to go too much.
it can be quite i think.
if you quite rich and sickening if you have too much of it, so just so he 's unit so i can see it.
this is running off her eggs.
and to finish this recipe off chopped up.
parsley , but crack paper across the top of it.
benedict and i bet you did n't have to go and pay lots of money at the cafe for it so they have it i hope you guys enjoy.
it , i 'm definitely going to happen this next sunday morning, i hope you too i hope you do as well.
