it gives today.
we are making macaroni salad.
a couple of people have asked for a hawaiian style, macaroni salad, and there are as many ways to make macaroni salad as there is ways to make chili.
so all of it is pretty much dependent on your tastes as well as where.
it is that you 've had your macaroni salad at, you know, like this, i made, i made the macaroni.
early this morning, zippy 's chili, i mean, zippy 's chili zippies makes there 's really al dente so it 's very snappy.
if you go to somewhere like tasties or some kind of korean barbecue, they totally, totally overcooked there 's till it really like soggy kind of.
but what that happens.
it does n't it the, the mayonnaise and stuff so, you know, like i said at all depends on your tastes for this.
so i 'm following a recipe that i decided that i 'm going to try almost every one of the recipes in this local cookbook and.
so well, it calls for six ounces of uncooked weight elbow macaroni, i do n't know what that was.
i just put in what i thought that we eat without a whole lot of leftovers and a lot of different things added in this that we prefer not to have so.
i guess what i 'll do is.
i 'll type the recipe in full and then i 'll just put in the stuff that i know we 're going to eat this is two teaspoons that was a cup of manning 's and oh crap here it is best.
foods , best foods is what it 's called.
west i believe of the mississippi and east of the mississippi.
it 's probably nothing else, it 's just the mannings.
anyway , this is a fourth of a teaspoon of sugar.
a fourth of a teaspoon of pepper, which i think is actually quite a lot to tell you the truth.
so , i think i 'm going to or a little bit last.
so i put way too much OK half a teaspoon of salt i put too much sugar half of a teaspoon of salt and.
let 's get rid of some of that.
you do n't need all of it.
and then the last thing enough for it did ask for mint celery and minced onions and since i 'm making this worse cotton, it 's his birthday and he does n't like that kind of crap in it.
i do depending on how i feel the last thing that it 's asking for is one eighth teaspoon of honda, she, honda.
she is japanese bonito fish soup.
i hope that can be seen there.
we go it 's one eighth of a teaspoon.
so i do n't know that, that will make an entire different in the way that this ends up tasting.
but i went out and got it anyway.
because i believe it 's in a couple of other of recipes that i 'm going to be making from this book, anyway, you wanted to make sure that the macaroni you cook it until it 's often, you drain it well, and you have to cool beat me when it 's not called cool , completely.
it 'll just suck up your mannings anyway.
you combine all of this.
you mix it well, and you refrigerate it for four hours before serving.
and if you have to add more mannings before you serve it, then there you go.
but holy macaroni, salad usually has a lot of mannings and that 's what makes it taste.
so good people.
so there you go macaroni salad.
