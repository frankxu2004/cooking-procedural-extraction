alright today and jake and food, we 're going to be making some authentic check style pork goulash.
so here i have about a pound of pork cubed up.
one small onion diced some lard paprika, caraway all purpose flour, and only other ingredient are going to some water alright.
so i 'm going to start off with about a quarter cup of large and get it off the spoon.
here we go next.
i 'm going to add or onions.
it 's like so right, or onions are starting to fry.
we keep cooking those until they start to brown up a little bit alright.
you can see are onions are starting to brown up next time when i had the pork when i add a half teaspoon here.
then i had a quarter teaspoon, paprika, and we 're going to brown this meat very well, alright is in see here.
we got to meet all night.
sweet brown, well, i guess it 's kind of hard to call the steam coming off with being too defined in the bottom of pan.
now we 're going to add a half cup of water to this.
we 're going to cover it and let it simmer for an hour alright there.
you have it after an hour a similar.
i 'm going to add a tablespoon of flour and am excited with the drippings get all that flower mixed in there, like.
so in a cup and a half of water stir that in and we 're going to cook it until it starts thickening alright.
so here we have our goulash after ten twenty minutes simmering.
see it sticking up nicely.
nice brown gravy, go great over some mashed potatoes, or some egg noodles.
so yummy make sure you follow my blog jake on food dot com and come on back to facebook to my channel, jason MI chef enjoy.
