hey , i 'm chef suzanne.
here we are in san francisco at fisherman 's wharf here to try out some of the local seafood.
and i hear that clam chowder and red bull, it is the thing to get love on.
i love, yeah, i mean, i probably on bing why not try to recreate headquarter test kitchen today we 're going to be making a delicious clam chowder in a bread bowl inspired by our road discovery tour in san francisco.
this is a pretty classic clam chowder except for the one.
fun addition, san francisco style of putting it in a bread bowl, so i love to make clam chowder with obviously fresh clans.
clam juice, really want to get that clam flavor a little bit of smokiness from some nice big cut bacon and some hardiness from potatoes.
and then some leeks, shallots, onion and garlic all of our aromatics and of course, our creamy elements to make up our delicious draw first step of this clam chowder is to fry the bacon.
very important, and try not to eat the bacon as a snack while you 're at it, which is toughest part for me.
you 're going to use a slotted spoon to a paper towel line plate to drain.
now i 'm going to add a little butter to the pan that is the best sound and cooking.
now we 're going to thought air aromatics, aromatics refers.
your flavoring agents, so in this case that is, our onion or leek and our garlic.
i 'm going to add the potatoes.
now as well, since those need a bit of extra time to get.
so we have a lot of fat in this part.
we have the fat from the bacon, and we have that from the butter.
i 'm going to sprinkle over some flower, and i 'm going to stir that in to cook off the rawness of the flower and that power is going to coat all of our vegetables and combine with the fat later when we add or heavy cream clam juice and milk you 'll see our chowder is going to pick it up really nicely OK.
so now that our flower is typically coding our aromatic time to add the liquid going to add some cream milk.
and clam juice, i am going to use the juice that 's released by the clams, which were going to cook in some wine and with a little bit of charlotte to the chowder.
but i want to cook them separately.
if i try to cook the clamp very high heat as we just talked about this is going to start to curdle, and it 's not going to be a good situation now, my shells, herself, i 'm going to ask some white wine.
this will create the liquid that will help steam the clams an open end.
now i want to wait for my wine to really come to a strong simmer before i cover this and let the clam start steam.
i 'm going to keep this closed for a few minutes.
i 'm going to usually going to shake the pan around after about five minutes.
i 'm going to very carefully and very quickly, check on my clams, make sure they 're opening going to take out the ones that have opened and wait for the rest of them to open any of your clams do n't open.
after about ten minutes.
throw them out while my clams are going on my child are simmering away now.
time take the bread bowl using a straight at night.
i 'm going to cutoff about the top quarter of the bread.
there 's no better fancy way to do this.
i 'm going to use my hands and i 'm going to scoop out all of this joe enis.
but leaving a bit of a border to hold up my clam chowder.
OK success, some of my clams are already opening this broth in here, registering the clams is like clam chowder gold.
we definitely want to add that to your chowder.
you do n't necessarily want the shallots.
i 'm going to strain this bra and just put the liquid, which has a liquor from the clan and the wine and the shallot and i 'm going to add that to my chowder to give it an incredible fresh clams.
do n't create your actual clams?
i do n't know san francisco.
i might have your clam chowder beat back here in new york, oh, my gosh.
i almost her out the bacon do n't forget the bacon lettuce save a few pieces just for dramatics, garnish on top of my bowl.
so really only needs a little bit of salt and a little bit of black pepper, of course, and i 've made clam chowder.
is the money shot right here?
now i 'm going to garnish as promised, a few pieces of bacon case, it does n't look enticing enough your little bread top hat, and wall up.
