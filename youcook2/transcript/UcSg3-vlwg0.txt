hey , everybody is froze ryanne in this video, i am making my turkey.
this is a very easy recipe, so, let 's get right to it.
so we 're starting off with some turkey breast ground turkey breast, and we are going to add in some chopped bell peppers and some chopped onion, you can use whatever color bell pepper.
you decide to use.
i 'm using a combination of orange yellow and red.
i also added in some minced garlic.
and now i 'm using my hands to make sure everything is well flip through out my bowl.
i 'm going to season this with some seasoning salt and some ground.
now i 'm adding in two medium sized eggs, and i will use my hands again to make sure everything is well incorporated.
so i like using my hands on my hands on type of girl.
if you 're not you can definitely use a kitchen utensil.
now i 'm going to add in my fillers and my first filter will be old mill.
i love using oatmeal and the clothes, my second filler will be plain breadcrumbs if you want to use season breadcrumbs that is completely fine.
this is just my preference, and that i 'm going to add in my favorite barbecue sauce.
so , once the barbeque sauces and there i 'm going to use my hands again to make sure everything is well incorporated and now, i 'm going to mold my meatloaf.
so i pretty much just put it in a loaf pan.
and then i jump it out on my big dish just like that.
we 're going to add some barbeque sauce on top of our meatloaf, and i 'm just going to add it a little bit at a time.
because i did n't want to overdo it if you 're confident in pudding a lot at once.
that 's now i 'm going to brush all of that barbeque sauce on top and then i 'm going to cover this meatloaf using my aluminum foil, and.
now it 's time to bake our meatloaf in the oven on three seventy five fahrenheit for about twenty five minutes, when your meatloaf comes out, you 're going to add more barbecue sauce.
brush it on using your brush, or you can use a spoon or whatever works for you.
and we 're going to leave this uncovered this time around.
but before we place it back in the oven, i actually like to use parsley flakes to sprinkle a little bit on top just to make it look nice and pretty.
and now we 're about to put it back in the oven, uncovered for about ten to fifteen.
more minutes, when it comes out, you wanted to sit for about five to ten minutes before cutting in.
and then my dear, we are ready to serve this make the perfect dinner.
my husband loved it.
my son loved it as well, a family favorite.
so tonight i am serving my turkey, meatloaf, along with some cheddar garlic mashed potatoes and that recipe will be available very soon.
and i also served it with some green beans.
