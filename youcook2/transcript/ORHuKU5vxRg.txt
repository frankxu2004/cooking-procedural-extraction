so quick bang is a mash recipe.
i picked out nine at potatoes.
these on maris piper really good for mashing and first of all, i 'm going to kill them, then i cut them up, into roughly the same size chunks.
so base of oil quickly together up more into a saucepan.
we want them fully submerged in water and stick them on a nice high.
eat so i 'm using these poor counter.
if it, as smoked bacon sausages, and i 'm going to grow them 'cause i find it a lot easier.
so , just got out some greens to serve with it.
i 'm just using someone of beans.
beans , so once it starts boiling at, turn it down.
you want to over oil, say my sisters are heartbreak, it.
i 'm just going to fit the major thing.
i 've got the green beans off just testing my potatoes with pork.
once there nice and tender you want to go ahead and drain them.
so to my mashed potatoes are usually adonais, tablespoon of butter, a good plug of milk tablespoon of hammers light and obviously salt and pepper to taste.
and , then i just start matching sausages are done so i 'm going to put them out.
so i 'm just boiling my cattle.
yes , i am going to use gravy granules.
