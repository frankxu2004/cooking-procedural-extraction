so i 'm just going to prepare i really popular.
that 's a mediterranean salad, one we had fairly often at home.
this one is to bully and do n't forget subscribe underneath and leave the comment, i 'd love to hear your thoughts on it.
what we have here is all the ingredients we need for tabouli.
firstly , the board can wait.
it 's this is a fine vertical weight, and she could get the dark brown or the light brown it does n't really matter.
we have salt and pepper will need some spring onions or scallions by font to use, or if you do n't have those, you could use half a brown onion.
we 've got tomatoes, we might use two or perhaps three of those will see these are roma tomatoes.
it does n't matter again.
what kind of tomatoes but the red ones are good.
if you 've got her loan to my nose that would be fine.
it really does n't matter.
or they got some lemons for lemon juice parsley, which will need big bunch of and some extra virgin.
a good olive oil is ideal because you 'll taste it in this part of the flavors of the dish alright, so that 's all we need.
and now we can get started, so i 'm just going to bowl here to prepare the borrible.
we 're just going to put that in a bowl that is one cup and that we 're going to add two cups of boiling water.
you do n't really have to do anything to this now.
just leave that to sit for.
i do n't know at least thirty minutes possibly an hour whenever if you get it done earlier in the day that 's fine if you have any water after it 's all absorbed if it 's still got a little bit.
then you can just squeeze any excess.
our ship, so this is what it looks like when it 's when it 's absorbed all its water.
the grains are all softap and there 's no extra moisture in there, as you can see, can be very light.
now and fluffy.
so now we 're ready to add all the salad items together, and that a bully.
so i 'm just going to add the board of all weight to the ball, you can see how that 's really fluffy now, and to that way going to add the parsley now.
the parsley, as you can seize, flat leaf parsley, now, you might know it as italian parsley or continental parsley.
it 's got it lovely really sort of strong flavor, and that 's what we use at home.
and that 's what my parents still grow.
mountains of so that 's needs quite a lot of parsley.
it 's sort of roughly chopped actually, we 're going to add the onion and the chop tomatoes.
now they just finally chopped nothing too fancy, and we 'll add the salt and pepper, the olive oil and the lemon trees.
now that was a whole lemon squeezed.
i 'm not going to edit old just yet.
i 'm just going to give that a toss like that.
give it a taste.
and then add either oil or lemon or salt as it needs it to taste.
but really that 's the basis of tabouli.
it 's very simple.
very nutritious and lovely and refreshing so happy, kids do n't want to go to.
