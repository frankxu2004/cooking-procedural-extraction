you know, it had notice the other day.
so there are no young people on all of these cooking shows, you know what you 're right, it ai n't no colored people, no for real.
it is weird, you know, what we should do right, there should be a show with two young people that are black, yeah, their stylish, and they cook were great ingredients and there 's drinking.
and they 're funny.
and there 's whiskey.
wish it really do this with a little permit is a great idea, but that could be a lot.
there is a lot of work if i feel like you wanna grab roger, instead.
yes , let 's do that because we 're sick of your struggle plate set up with your food point.
this is byron brown.
you want everybody welcome and thank you so much for joining us on the very first episode of butter, and brown we are so excited.
so , the first thing we 're going to do just like you 'll see, on every episode of butter and brown the follow is we 're going to start off with a cocktail, you know, it, and it will always be comprised of a brown liquor.
because we love it.
so much and really.
because i 'm tired of seeing everybody order that crack at the bar like cranberry and vodka la water, long island ice tea irish car bomb college, is, over it 's done letting OK.
so we 're going to teach you today how to make a classic drinks.
so you can do it at home and it has a classic name is, well, here 's what you need a little bit of sugar.
so megas, orbiters regular an orange, some bourbon, we 're going to use for roses.
it 's part of the best you can get under twenty bucks, couple glasses, and an orange and while i get started steps, is going to grab some ice?
you need about a teaspoon of sugar per glass.
remember , this is according to your level of sweetness.
we like to taste the liquor.
so we do n't put that much ETA ten ashes of the angus, stora, bitters do regular ones and that two to three of the orange portal flavor got it.
and two ounces of bourbon per glass now you can move of course.
we want to.
but keep it classy.
my friend now, we 're going to drop these two big beautiful fancy ice cubes in the glasses.
well , we prefer to use the bigger ice cubes because they melt a lot slower than the ice chips do.
but so now the last thing we want to do is we want to take that every day or is that we talked about, we want to cut two pieces of the rind off.
there 's one for leslie.
and then there 's one for maine.
that 's not big enough when we got another one for maine.
we want to hold that rein over the glass itself track the oils in press on it and see that almost burnt off my beard.
careful there want to rub that around the rim of the glass and the last thing.
we want to do is just drop that in a drink for a little garnish and enjoy how was your easter.
would you know, some of those cool with church you better than me know, but of course, you know, there was a dinner?
after and then, what do they have there?
that dry spaghetti in that big pan with melted cheese.
miners , why do they have it for granted that this, all a lot of people.
notice the only pasta dish they gonna.
make , but there 's so many other arts like shrimp scampi, who can make or penny, ala botica, would it look chick in CZ, sounds good.
you trying to make the teacher and getting this kitchen.
let 's see, we already got our dresses.
all right, all right now about this dish, let 's make it happen.
so we 're going to outback.
and it 's really easy.
all of this stuff is things, you probably have in your cabinet right now.
definitely there 's penne pasta.
we got a little olive oil.
we 're going to have some aromatics, shallots, garlic little busy and little, then we have a little tomatoes.
and of course, the chip no.
because we 're too young, black people less acknowledge this chicken shit right now, i, i 'll be honest it 's been a love hate relationship nice juicy, sometimes i 've been, been embarrassed of you in public, you know, bryce some ties it 's been a back and forth thing up and down sometimes i love it sometimes, it do n't delicious, i mean.
but in the end, it 's, it 's been there for me when nothing else was i love chicken the.
so does everybody else no one other race of people, one of the walk it does n't love chick in i 'll wait.
but i 'm going to hold you down, exactly there is n't one chicken is amazing could go for some right.
now you been there for me when no one else was it 's mean, you till the end chicken menu shit even a fried egg is it.
now that we got that out the way we can go ahead and get started with making the sauce.
so i do that, and said he 's going to show you how to marinate this chair this is very similar all, we want to do is marinate both sides of this chick in a little olive oil season liberally, on both sides with a little closer song and finish it off with some pepper and all that 's left to do is put that off to the side carrisi, perfect timing.
now that i 'm done did n't go ahead and get started on the sauce.
so now i would finish prepping everything we can go ahead and get started with this op set is going to go ahead and work that out and i 'm going to tell you how it 's done the first thing you want to do is pour a little EVOO in the pot and saute up those aromatics that shall appear book, the garlic and those herbs remember we talked about building flavors from the beginning you do n't want things to be nasty after that you 're going to do some of those tomatoes throw goes into the pan along with the whole can of the tomato sauce we 're going to go ahead and bring that to a boil.
so you set it up with a little and then we let that come.
because we want those tomatoes to breakdown just sounds lovely smell of leather after we do that we usually want to let those tomatoes right down to them.
because we do n't want to do super chunky, then we 're going to pour in the vodka and the half a cup of cream bring it back to a lawyer.
so that 's the vodka can boil itself out and then we have our soft at that point we want to turn it down to a simmer and let that go ahead and make away while i get started with this chicken.
now by the time we get to the chick in you want to make sure that the pen is screaming hot the reason for this, is we want to teach you guys how to make the most moist juicy chicken possible we already know that leslie does n't like the word moist what 's wrong with it, it sounds like dirty pet we 're not talking about dirty panties were talking about moist chicken, an after you guys try, this technique at home, you 'll see exactly why i described it as such.
now less he 's going to put that already marinated chicken cutlet on that screaming hot pan you 're going to cook it on one side for a minute to a minute and a half after that you 're going to flip it and let it cook another minute to a minute and a half.
so you see that color on both sides they 're going to reduce the heat to low, you 're going to cover it, and you 're going to let it cook an additional ten minutes and what we 're going to end up with is the most flavorful juicy moist chicken, possible.
so at this point, all we have left to do is playing we went ahead and mix the sauce on the pasta together.
so that way that labels can marry in that, possibly get all coated you get chicken finished every member, you can keep the chick in whole, or you can cut it up and slices maybe you want to mix it up in your socks it really depends, on the use we prefer our slice it 's a little bit for you are you, you can also garnish with a little ways and you have jeez, you know, i want to love you i do n't know why she stupid person i do n't know why.
so much better than others.
so unsettled rack again you mean, you miss that sharp cheddar melted all over the top of it, almost at you right we want to thank you guys.
