hey guys, thanks for stop by ballistic barbeque today.
we 're grilling korean style, short ribs also known as kalbi ribs love 'em.
let 's get going, or i 'm going to start this recipe off with the marinade and even in korea, it kind of varies from family to family.
this is something that sort of morphed in my house will just from my discovering other agent ingredients, that being said, i realized some of these ingredients i 'm using are not korean.
but taste good, good on beef pork chicken.
it 's a good marinade.
we 're going to start off with one cup of soy sauce.
and i like to use a blender half cup of sugar.
now i 'm using this palm sugar, and i discovered this doing a thai recipe stuff.
it becomes very, very creamy.
i love the texture of this regular white sugar is perfect.
now i 'm using a one half cup of black glutinous rice wine.
but like a mirror in would be great.
you do n't have to use this, this is going to just something i like to use one half of a white onion.
and this is a medium size.
white , sweet onion one half cup of honey.
now this is something that is going to probably raise a few eyebrows, but it 's awesome stuff.
and it 's fish sauce.
now it does n't taste fishy.
it 's kind of a distilled flavor.
but what it is it 's a flavor enhancer and i 'm telling you in sauces this stuff.
it 's a miracle worker.
it brings out and enhances flavors does not make it taste like fish.
i swear to you.
it does not make it taste like fish.
two tablespoons of freshly minced ginger.
now if you do n't have access to fresh ginger, use powdered ginger.
but there 's a special way that i learned of processing this and getting it ready for the sauce.
if you do n't do it this way, you 're going to end up with like fibers.
and you 'll end up with harry meet, which is awful, so what i 'll do is i 'll first peel the root slice.
it into like coin shapes that you 're going to smash it with the side of your knife.
what that does, is it pulverizes all the fibers?
and then you just finally mix it up.
and you want to have that problem with the hairs, and i 'm using one tablespoon.
there 's a lot of sweet going on here, and i like just a little bit of warmth in the back of your throat.
this is korean chili paste.
i butchered the real name, but it 's good chang or something like that, i 'll put it up.
but if you ca n't find this just any chili paste will work fine, but right now last but certainly not least my favorite ingredient in this marinade.
and that 's fresh asian pear now.
if you do n't have access to asian pear just a regular bosch pair would work, i mean, even probably can pears in a pinch.
but this just makes this recipe is a nice clean crisp, slightly sweet flavor to it.
now let 's get this blended up now.
i like to start out at a lower speed on the blinker here just to get everything chop without splashing all over the place.
they just start increasing videos, alright, so here 's that we 're going to be cooking now.
this is three pounds of beef short ribs, and it 's called flanken style, which just basically means it 's been cut across the bone.
most butcher stores will have this, if not, you can request it be cut this way.
i personally ask for it to be cut custom.
anyway , i just like it, a little bit thicker than the ribs that they 're selling and one little like to do before i prepare these stick the tip of a knife and break the meat.
you 're going to have dust on here from the bonds, from the bands.
are they use?
and i like to get all that off before i put this in a marinade alright.
let 's get these things in a marinade alright.
so pretty basic stuff we 're going to take the container personally.
i like using these things.
there are made by cam bro have a nice tight lid on him, you can stack i put the ribs in here trying to make an effort to make sure they 're not sticking together side by side.
now the marinade just cook the river to marinate what i 'm going to do.
now is put the lid on.
i want to make sure first they 're fully immersed in this marinade.
put it in the fridge and deli, marinating for about four to five hours before we start this cook little longer spine, i mean, if you want to marry him overnight.
but these are going to be about five hours, anyway i 'll see at the grill.
all right guys are going to start grilling up to his short ribs now, and i 'm going to start off doing it a little, differently than i used to do, my short ribs.
i used to use a direct heat throughout the entire cook.
now i 'm starting off with an indirect heat and the reason.
i 'm doing this is.
there 's a lot of sugar in the sauce and what i 'm going to do is just sort of get the carmelization going.
now rather than having this huts this sweet stuff, dripping into this hot coals are starting flareups.
and then what i 'll do is more of a kind of a, i guess you could call it a reverse.
here will see all these after there pretty much cooked in case.
i did n't mention it when i took it out of the marinade.
what i did was just more or less.
shook off the excess.
can you can see?
the , it 's starting to kind of cook through the surface now.
i 'm going to go and start clipping.
these smells really, really good little close to the heart calls, so maybe well done the other guys are looking really good.
this is going to leave us with some very, very, very juicy meat.
so these are just a quarter inch then.
so they do n't need a whole lot of cooking.
all right guys, now we 're going to do is just finish these often again.
it 's more like more or less, a reverse.
here it does on some direct heat, finish off that caramel, ization.
very guys, we 're done, we get these on the platter, and we 're going to put it up inside.
are you guys here?
we are having this with some jasmine rice and this is a kind of a SLA that i made.
it 's got some red cabbage without asian pear little cucumber.
some cilantro give us a try smells really, really good.
get around these bones, here.
i do n't know if you can see that really juicy really, really, really tender.
i love this recipe.
it 's got everything, i love nice amount of sweet.
just the perfect amount of heat it 's a winter.
anyway , guys, thanks for stopping by and i 'll see you in the next video.
