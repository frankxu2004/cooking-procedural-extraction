welcome to live in the kitchen.
today , we 're going to make laxus soup.
and it 's a soup that is both creamy and spicy.
so , let 's get started an review.
our ingredients, first, we have four cups of chicken stock, two teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil three quarters of a pound of chick in that, has no bones?
no skins, an we trimmed it into strips, one and a half ounces of thai red curry paste, one cup of coconut milk and as an option, you can do two kefir lime leaves finely chopped half a pound of brown, rice vermicelli noodles twelve shrimps that have been peeled and cooked and then for garnish we 're going to do two green onions sliced on the diagonal one cup of bean sprouts two tablespoons of mint, or you could use coriander one lime sliced an as another option, you could use some, some bout chili paste.
so we brought her chicken stock to a boil and we 're going to add our raw chicken to our saucepan here and cook it.
now we 're going to add our thai red curry paste and cook it for about one minute.
now we 're going to add all of our chicken stock to our saw spin as, well as our coconut milk and then we 're going to bring that to a boil and then reduce it and let it simmer for about ten minutes.
we 're going to add.
are vermicelli noodles.
you can break them up slightly so they fit into your pot.
and you 're going to cook them for five to seven minutes.
so here we have our laksa soup, and we have garnished it with bean sprouts.
green onions, mint, and we 're just going to squirt some fresh line on tour soup, and it 's ready to enjoy.
