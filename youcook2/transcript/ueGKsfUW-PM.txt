now it 's time for us to prepare the mixture for the falafel for this recipe.
we need first of all to solve the chick peas and feather beans, right phibians, of course, so here i have one cup of drive chip keys.
i got on the ball, with some water in it and have a cup of drive for reading.
so for about twenty four two forty eight hours and then about twenty four hours, they look just like this little plump and real nice end, part, and then what i would do is i will bring all the water for an accord, look like this, the dried chick peas and the drive through these are very easy to find.
you can find them in many middle eastern stores, and you can also find them in your favorite supermarket like kroger in the international.
i 'll find many, many stuff and those international ideas.
you do n't even have to go and visit a middle eastern store now.
those days because they had so many things available.
this international IO, they have all kind of beans they have all kinds of sources.
they have analyze that you find in middle eastern steps.
so will drain all the water from the chick peas and feather beans and our place them in about like this to this.
i will add two medium onions that i roughly chopped three to four, garlic cloves have green pepper that i just roughly chopped again one whole bunch call steve, you said all the ingredients can you softball for, for the mixture often happen.
so what i would do is i will grind all these ingredients together, using an electoral meat grinder what are you easy to mix all these ingredients together as you grind them, well mixed up too.
and we need everything to be real, fine.
so that 's why you have to use the meat grinder all these ingredients are nicely grinded together.
now we will season that this, we will need to add one.
this phone of baking powder.
this will help them popped up when we are frying them half teaspoon baking soda.
we will use one teaspoon of ground coordinator half teaspoon of commune common and then will season it with one to T teaspoons of salt and want to spend hours.
of course, you can add more or less, if you want him to be more spicy.
you can add more about, or you can even add red pepper to give it that click on that heat and develop it now.
we have all the ingredients in here.
we will make everything nicely together.
look a beautiful, a green color from the parsley and from the green pepper this gonna be amazing, amazing fall.
affect you will never tasted any of the collaterals like these, you will make all the time.
falafel mixture is nicely mix them blunted wall together.
now what we would do if we look at the rust under fulgurator for about half an hour for all these things, will be instrumental, made together.
and they will be ready for us to make the patches for love, and mixer is nice and cool, now.
we left it in the fridge for a about having our just a marinade and just to hold itself, so now to make the patties.
i 'm using the falafel mode.
this is very, very office is probably fifty years old i got it from a friend.
and i use it all the time, and i love it, it 's really nice.
it comes in different sizes, but i like the small one.
be cause it 's not so thick and the philosopher comes out is always nice and crispy using the proper mode for today.
if you do n't have a falafel more you can always make the patties by hand, you just have to dip your hands in some flowers.
so i will take about maybe one.
they will spawn of mixture and try to back it into the mode and smooth all the surface is need the bus, popped up and then just release them on a.
i miss you time it up.
it 's easier, so they wo n't stick on to anything.
continue making all on.
but i like to make all the petits, fours before i get the oil hub for.
much , much easier, and you see using the mold, you get the same shape, same size, for the apple throughout the mixture.
that 's why i like to use them.
now we have a whole tray of falafel, patties are ready for frying now.
we are ready to fly the falafel.
i have a nice walk here that we get a heat to this, i will add some oil.
i 'm using some grape seed oil.
i really like this oil, has very light flavor specially for flying the falafel?
it does n't take away anything from the flap and i 'd love to use it and it 's really healthy for you, and it 's available at many, many stores, and specially at kroger.
i always find it there.
it 's not a problem finding this kind of oil so a lot of heat for a few minutes the oil seems to be heated.
the only way to check if it was hot enough is by taking a piece of bread and just dip it in there.
if it sizzles immediately, that means it 's warm.
i think i need maybe another minute or so.
it 's still not that hot, so li.
he did piece of bread there until it 's sizzles.
are you is nice and hot?
i will take some fatties problem hot.
so many of them will reduce the temperature of the oil and then they will not fry that well.
so will wait about maybe thirty seconds in between each one and then we 'll keep dropping few of them smell.
so good already will fry them on one side for about maybe two minutes until nice and brown and then will flip them and fry them from the other side.
i will look beautiful on top they are and of course, the smell is amazing for that, please.
the last pieces of the philosopher sit for a few minutes to call off.
