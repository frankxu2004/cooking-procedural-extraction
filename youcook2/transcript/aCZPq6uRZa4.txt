everyone loves to cook breakfast down again and no cook breakfast would be complete without some of these little babies.
let 's make some hash browns on the one pot chef to make a hash browns.
first things, first, we 're going to obviously need some potatoes, and what i 've done is i 've just run a kilo.
the food processor using the shredding blade.
if you do n't have a food processor, you can just run them through a cheese grater, and i put them into a calendar with a glass bowl underneath, or you can just stick it in the sink and just squeeze the potatoes with your hands just to get rid of all that excess liquid.
i transferred a potato into a large mixing bowl and two that i 'm adding in two tablespoons of flower.
just plain flower little bit of salt and some pepper.
i 'm also adding in some garlic powder, which is great for a bit of extra flavor.
you do n't have to use garlic.
it 's entirely optional.
you could also use a different herb or spice that you prefer or make your own mixture, and one lightly big nig, just using a spoon just mix all that together.
i divided the mixture into little patties, and we 're just going to flatten them out as we cook them.
i 've got my fry pan with a bit of olive oil on the bottom, and we 're just going to take this over a medium heat until it 's nice and steaming hard, we 're going to cook our hash browns in batches be careful putting them in three on the first cover, and just press them dance slightly to flatten them.
i 'm going to fridays for about two to three minutes, each side, or until they are golden and crispy.
they 're looking golden delicious and which is going to transfer these onto a baking tray lined with some absorbent kitchen paper.
once all the hash browns have been fried, we 're just going to put this into a lower than one hundred and twenty degrees, celsius for about five to ten minutes just to make sure there nicely warmed through and fully cooked, and here are some of our completed hash browns looking absolutely gorgeous, and they smell amazing.
so i 'm going to have a little taste.
young crispin, golden gorgeous on the outside and got that fluffy sort of little bits of potato all inside you can really taste the garlic in it, which is great.
because you can pretty much change the flavor of these to whatever suits your own personal taste mister perfect is part of a nice full cooked breakfast bacon and eggs and sausages but.
it 's two o'clock in the afternoon when i 'm recording this.
so i do n't really feel like cooking a full breakfast at this time.
