so let 's get in the kitchen and make an american classic BLT.
how much are any sort of assembled item like a sandwich.
my biggest thing is having everything equally distributed because i hate a sandwich.
we 've item, one everything falls out.
sometimes , that is bound to happen because of mayonnaise or mustard.
economists tend to make it a little slippery which is kind of funny, but i like only sized tomatoes.
just so i can, you know, it 's like three slices in three slices.
two pieces of lettuce, you know, six pieces of bacon, or however many pieces just evenly line it up so toughness.
then , then, OK, let me just give you a little make, your specially cut tomatoes.
chevron dinosaurs really super important, totally that top off, i mean, i thought you did.
let 's pretend is it.
yeah , yeah, yeah, that 's good.
so , you know, not crazy, but then enough to where you can stack, it.
not have like these huge chunky crazy tomatoes.
i guess he cut that up.
yeah , definitely just probably just that 's american, maybe one just for safety, and i 'll wash the lettuce once you have all your ingredients, uh, basically i have to do is get a little assembly line going with your cook bacon lettuce and tomato and your toasted bread with a little bit of mayo.
once you 're done with all that, all you have to do a stack at all together and make a beautiful BLT, i or love sure.
