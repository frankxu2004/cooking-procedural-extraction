nothing like a warm spring showers there kind of freshened up everything certainly remind me when i was on holiday in southern italy sitting down there on the side of the street there in collaborator.
please call mara tea drinking a glass of wine and eating a plate of crispy, calamari, and i got the recipe.
i 'm going to share that with you now.
very , very simple and what we 're going to do is, and i had about six hours at a hundred and seventy five grams of self raising flour, and i know i 'm just shaking in you can weigh it out.
if you want and to that, i 'm going to sprinkling a little bit of salt and then a teaspoon of paprika.
so i thought paprikas nice to also get that lovely color, too, and then to that we 're going to add eight fluid ounces.
or if you like two hundred and fifty MLS of cold water that is that 's it just create a little well, in the middle there pull some of that water in about a third of it and then just stir that round and keep staring that we are you can see.
that 's thickening up and what you 're looking for, for me is a kind of heavy double cream consistency of course, just let that rest a little bit, i 've got some screen here.
i 'm just cleaning film.
the talks, i do n't want all those smells of the fish to kind of linger out.
all , through your fridge there that often happens it is n't.
it now squids look at these look at that tube is not a wonderful tube there.
hello , are you doing hello?
i 'm just cut into strips, and you can see here that little crunch at the back there.
that means that a little bit of cartilage sometimes you get there in the corner that comes in lots of different shapes.
all these little sort of bits it looks like something you get with toys is n't one of those little plastic things, and then we 're going to cut those, the rest of that into strips.
very , very simple when with regard to the slightly smaller ones.
you can also cut those in rings.
but it just cut that little bit on the angle there and then you got these little bits here with the tentacles and write the end, they 've got plastic bit called beak, which you can just snap off like that.
there you go perfect couple of tablespoons of flower.
just sprinkling like that, and slightly sore toss, it using your fingers.
pop goes straight to you better.
just give that a bit of a shake.
it like george are.
there is n't it talking about the waves of the sea in his result, oh, delightful.
i 'd like to the idea of using their tongues here.
really does help when, you want to pick up your piece of calamari and plunged them into your fryer little bit of control movement there.
like those lovely straight in, there.
here we are just like on work at a chipper year and just let those look away.
that wo n't take very long and that 's literally going to take about three or four minutes.
i 've got some lovely fresh limes and lemons over here and what i do is.
i cut the cheeks of these.
i do n't know.
i think there are about ready to come out.
now from testing and look at that is, really lovely people including shapes just a little bit of a tap and look at that all comes off, and, that is perfect.
it 's OK, and just sort of step those that pile those up and run away in there, like that now.
we are an insert that with the little wedges of lemons and limes.
i think that 's just fantastic like that, just look at that great beautiful.
