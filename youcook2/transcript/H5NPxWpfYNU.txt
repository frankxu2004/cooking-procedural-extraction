today , we 're going to make bogo game.
it 's basically korean barbecue meat.
no in here, i have half a cup of soy sauce and a quarter cup of water, water helps cut the soy sauce down a little bit.
now i have three, three tablespoons of brown sugar just from green onion.
one tablespoon of sesame E seeds.
i have two pieces of ginger, two slices of ginger that i feel i 've got four cloves of garlic that i 've crushed up well.
here 's a tip on some ginger.
i found an old piece of ginger in refrigerator when i 'm gonna do is whenever i get done cooking, today will throw it down the garbage disposal.
be the last thing, i put in there and how to help keep the garbage disposal smelling good.
anyway , get three tablespoons of app, applesauce ca n't believe i forgot what that was called anyway.
pinch of black pepper note eight tablespoon sesame E oil.
there are soy sauce is just starting to bubble a little bit, so, let 's go ahead and mix everything up.
i want to eat the soy sauce up pretty good.
but i do n't really want to cook it right.
now just want to make sure all the sugar dissolves the garlic gets heated up.
he gets heated up and all that give off its flavor to the marinade noted here.
i have about half of a large onion.
they 're not really quite a large onion, a medium to large onion sliced pretty thin right source, sources good and hard again.
i 'm going to pour this into the onion mix alright and will let this cool down.
i have my beef here.
this is really thinly sliced.
i did n't slice it.
i bought it already sliced from the korean market, when i do.
i 'm going to cut it into smaller piece and was going to cut these pieces in half, maybe only going this way too.
now take my marinade, do n't take, throw these pieces of beef in there as you can see my beef just barely fits into a bowl.
but then i do n't have any room to mix it up.
so i 'm going to put in a bigger bowl.
but you can use this same marinade to make colby just makes this up.
looks like i could have made a little more marinade, too.
but i think we 're going to be our and we 're going to let this marinate for about an hour alright meet been marinating for awhile.
so i 'm going to take some of this meeting were going to cook it cook a little bit more i want to have some extra what you can do is you can just put it in a zip lock bag and freeze it and you can have some for later now, traditionally you would have some chop che noodles in here you put on water, soak him for about twenty minutes, and then while it 's cooking it 's just about done throwing in there my kids love him i like him.
but i 'm not going to put any in there today anyway i 'm just going to let this keep cooking, he had started cook down.
now getting close yeah, i think that, that 's pretty much looks done to maine, no need to cook it to nothing anyway go ahead and turn that off.
we will get ready to eat alright time for a taste test.
let 's see, what we got the little son john, no more.
