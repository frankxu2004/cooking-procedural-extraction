here i 'm gonna show, you.
how to make nuns on the hob.
very easy almost as good as in the town door.
do i make yesterday and roll it up here, and as you can see it 's quite fair?
and we can put in here.
there 's no grease in there, at all which is a hot pan.
i should put in there just like that.
and if you watch for a couple of minutes you 'll see that the bottom of it heats up bubbles will appear on the top select when you go to a town.
dori restaurant and they bring up knowledge with all the bubbles on top.
i 've actually found it doing it this way is better than doing it in the oven, now.
it 's obviously better in a town door.
but if you do n't have one, then wanted to try it on the pad, 'cause it does work very well, you can see if you get closer in there now.
so there 's mobile starting to appear.
and that means that it is cooking on the underside.
the bubbles will get quite large.
does the little ones at first, that means it is certainly took on the bottom side yet only takes about three minutes per nine and then once they 're cooked, you just, uh.
but at the top of it, put it in the oven in a low oven, under a towel of some sort, and it will keep warm.
see they 're getting quite large.
now just look at the restaurants we getting nice bubbles on the top OK now, is the bubble start?
i 'll check the other side again.
see it does n't stick no.
there 's no need for any grease at all in this, uh, did n't stick it all and i 'm getting quite nice and big, a lot times.
i do turn it over.
just a quick, the other side just for a little bit that gives it some blacks.
parson brown spots on the outside.
this is absolute.
gorgeous , is really nice way to cook it?
we done any work done while you 're camping it can be done just for an easy lunch.
let 's say, i do make this up today ahead of time.
so i 've got it whenever i want it.
i do use freshly easter my own.
my recipe is actually on my blog, how do use fresh?
because i do see that works a little bit better than a package stuff and fresh lease, is easy to come by these days just go ask me any baker?
even the major shocks grocery stores little bit on top you 've got yourself in on that is, really nice to give you more bubbles there alright.
so that 's it just like in there.
somebody here genuine.
labor is quite nice.
