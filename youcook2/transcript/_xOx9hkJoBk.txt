gay guys welcome to aussie grill a to die on making salt and pepper squid.
now this is one of my favourites, so sit back and enjoy rock ice salt and pepper squid one of my pub favourites, so for starters.
you 'll need some squid tubes, and you just want to cut them into rings.
they came by your rings, pre-cut, but this way it 's cheaper and it 's just as easy.
so this is what we 're looking for here now for, aflao mix jump.
so here i 've got a third of a cup of plain flour and a quarter cup of corn flour.
this , i 'm going to add a teaspoon of salt just regular table salt.
a teaspoon of white pepper a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper.
now this will just give it a bit of zing, you can adjust your coin paper to your taste and a quarter teaspoon of black pepper and just give that a quick mix.
and then simply coat your squid rings with the flour mix.
allow these to stand for a few minutes so that mixture can stick, and here i 've got a barbecue plate preheated to a medium high heat.
of course, you can use your frying pan if you like.
and i 've got a generous dose of olive oil on there.
and i 'm just going to cook these for about a minute, each side.
so quick and easy there done already guys just remove them from the barbeque under some paper towel to drain off any excess fat.
serve up with a nice side salad, and you 're dumb.
and , that is top.
