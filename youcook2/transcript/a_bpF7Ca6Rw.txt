well , when you 're flying a fish for sushi, especially to know, you do n't want to get too wet.
so when you do pull it to make sure that when you cut it out and go lay all the filets down skin side down.
so they do n't get wet and when we started off right behind the head may take our knife we 're going to slide up right behind the head come down into the belly cavity slice right through the belly cavity.
i like to spin the turn around.
come through here right there, top of the head almost trace your steps want to get the all trace, that.
and then you can take your knife straight down to the backbone and then what i do is i turned a knife around push tonight through to the other side and run it straight across you can go ahead and grab your filet.
and i had skin side down.
skinning , tuner is a very different, very different than skinning most fish, and basically what we do is, we call when we do it sooner, we call lauren amount first.
we 're going to cut the belly, belly bones out.
once we get that done, we 're going to go ahead and cut down the center line, take her gotta, have a flexible knife?
be able to bend like this, if you do n't have one that wo n't bend like that.
it makes it very difficult to fill a these tuna.
you just keep working it slowly, and voila.
the last step on flying a tuna is removing the dark meat.
goodnight anna, dark meat is kind of spliced through the middle of the fillets.
so you kind of have to.
gotta go and take a little bit off at a time.
is it comes in it 's almost like a triangle?
you really should use a curve edge knife to do this with it makes it a little easier.
but in the same sense you want to make sure you get all this dark meat out.
we 're cutting sushi.
there 's a little part here that you do n't use.
it got a little fine line right here.
what we 're going to do is we 're going to remove that you want to cut these really thin pursue shaming there.
absolutely , delicious and when it 's this fresh, you do n't even need any wishabi that is awesome.
there we go call outstanding alright.
