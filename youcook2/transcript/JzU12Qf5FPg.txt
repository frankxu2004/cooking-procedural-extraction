hi , i 'm daddy welcome to bettys kitchen.
today , we 're making country fried chick in now.
i have a lot of chicken recipes in boaz kitchen.
you probably know that i usually use chicken breast meat.
and i 've done oven fried chicken breast.
i 've done chicken nuggets.
i 've done casseroles with chick in.
but i never really made it country style, and by that i 'm going to means i 'm going to use chick in that has legs.
it has rest made there will be thighs and will leave the skin on now, if you look over here.
i 've made my purchase from the grocery store, and these are in packets, and here we have our chicken breast with ribs, and here is a package of leg quarters that means the thigh and leg, are attached?
and i 'm going to detach those, and then we have our wings now.
i would like to go through an remove at like that, because that 's not going to say good.
i will leave the skin on because it has a good flavor.
is nice and crispy and people like that, so give me a minute?
i get these repaired.
and then we 'll come back then, get him ready to fry.
so i have my chicken pieces, prepared you can see that there 's less fat on them.
because i took this much fat and gristle an organ meat off that i did not want in my fried chikin.
and i 've got this organized, so that i have at the chicken legs.
and i had the chicken thighs in the middle.
i have the wings or a lot of those, and then over here we have the chicken breasts.
an I have already sought of them.
i just use regular assault.
i usually add ized version, and i just sprinkled all of this very, well, on one side, then, sort of turned it over and sprinkle it on the other side, worked it in with my hands.
that 's been sitting here for a moment like that, now.
let me talk about the preparation of the skillet, you 'll need a large skillet, and this probably will not hold all of that were cooking for a crowd tonight.
i 've got this thirteen and a half inch iron skillet, an into that i have put peanut oil, and i 'd say it 's about a quarter of a cup.
i wanted enough to cover the bottom completely and go up the size just a little bit.
now , too that i 'm going to add one tablespoon of butter.
so i have that sitting out here, and i had heated the oil a little bit.
so you see, that is beginning to run.
so let me get some work done and i 'll be back to continue, i want to show you how i prepare my chicken for frying.
i start my oil in terms of getting a heated anna, keep an island.
you do n't want it to smoke if it smokes.
i throw that away and start again, but i think will be OK with this, you can see.
i 've already done some work here.
this just to save time.
i always take zip lock bag to some generic plastic bag.
and then i use flower.
this is surprising flower.
you could use all purpose.
it does n't really matter in this application, and i have already used one cups worth for this match now.
the whole thing is about eleven pounds, so if you 're not making that much, you 'll have to adjust downward this time.
i think i 'll just put in maybe half of a cup.
because i 've got a few pieces left to cover an what i do for each piece, and this is a breast pieces very large.
but then salted i put it in here and then sort oppose the top with my hands.
i do n't zip lock it, and then shake until it completely covered, and it will get a good amount of flour making a really nice crust.
and it would probably be more convenient for me to move these over is very heavy.
but i 'm going to move it over here.
this would be a steady and let 's check that i 'm returning it up just a little bit.
am i take my sack of flour and modest test?
you see how that sizzles, that is OK and it is browning a little bit.
because of the better so, i think with your head start putting them in just to let you see, how you do it.
you should do one layer at a time.
so if you have more chicken than that is possible to do double layer.
you just have to work more at it because you need to turn these and with one layer, it 's perfect.
so just, ladies in and they should sizzle like that, and i 'm going to try to make consistent and get maybe one of our couple of each piece and put them right up against each other do you get two thousand there.
and no legs, so that we found a leg read hard to find because we had this is going to turn this down let me go ahead.
and spanish phone on the skillet, then, it 's going to go together and as soon as i get my chick in layered into one layer in the skillet, then i want to pepper it, and i use fresh black peppercorns, and i put it in a grinder and then just grind along the top that way.
i am sure that each piece gets some freshly ground pepper.
now you 'll see i have all this chicken left.
there 's a lot of chicken eleven pounds.
this skillet is thirteen and a half inches.
across so you see how much of it did maybe a third, so i 'm going to have to use a second skillet.
my second one is a little smaller.
i think it 's ten and a half inches and then i may have to do two shifts at these you can see that my chicken is sibling right along.
but i want to do is just have it lightly browned on the one side.
and then i turn it over, and i like to use that, i mean, for which death here 's the chick in that for me.
if handier than using toms you can eat ca n't, if you prefer.
and that way it does n't hear specifics.
anna center, here if you save a nice golden brown, look an OK if you would like to you can try this chicken entirely on the stove top that what i like to do is just sucking away, and evan let it cook santill.
it 's not halfway done and turn it over.
and you get the other job brown.
and then check for doneness and then adapt fried chicken not bad chicken has been in the oven at four hundred fifty degrees for about ten minutes.
so i just checked on it, and it looked like it was ready to turn.
and i 've turned all of it except over to this leg and the bottom side that was down is right here.
so we want to put that side up and hear that.
last wing, ma'am pushing this back, then pushing my rack back next be careful with your knuckles here.
and then closing, we have indoor again.
and it 's going to need another ten minutes or so, and then i 'll take it up my chicken is been diving in the oven, or frying in oven for about twenty.
and i 've been checking both sides.
actually about companies to go out, i turned if you have them because of the software needs a little more browning on the bottom side.
but this is basically done.
so i 'm going to bring crowds, adams, but here we can bring out easily and put it alamat so it does n't burn your counter.
once you bring it out, then just take each piece of chick in with on a tray that has paper toweling, and then it will drain and will turn out to let it cool off my country fried.
chicken is done and it all came together about the same time, and here it is.
and i 've got it draining.
but it still piping hot.
so what i want to do is to take this big long tray.
because we 're going to have a crowd of people and we need to have some way of containing it, it warm.
so i 'm going to just start over here.
he 's a nice chicken breasts.
and let 's go back over here and get something, and this will get us started.
now big footing more in.
and i think this is going to be a great solution for a lot of buffets.
i 'm going to have this summer, and with them or they coming up soon.
i 'm going to use it.
