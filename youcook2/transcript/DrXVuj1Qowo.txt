i welcome to show me the curry dot com.
i 'm hindolam, anuja.
and they be making jenna, masala.
and this is a recipe shared with us by, by a brother in law, and it does a fantastic job with it and my sister refuses to learn how to make it.
because she knows.
if she learns to stop making it then actually wo n't have a choice.
after this video, and here 's what you need two cups of jenna or garbanzo beans soaked in eight cups of water, one.
bay leaf, one black cardamom and a two inch piece of cinnamon salt to taste one and a half tablespoons.
oil , one eighth teaspoon, asafetida one fourteen point five ounce, can of crushed tomatoes half teaspoon, each of chuck masallah red chili powder and, are down a powder and dried mango powder one tablespoon, jenna, orchulli, masallah, two teabags sliced onions and green chilies optional for garnishing.
so for our channel, masala recipe, we have a pressure cooker going on high heat right now, and we 've added.
are jenna into their using the same water that it was soaked in?
so that 's in there and to this, we 're going to add in the bay leaf, black caramel, cinnamon stick tea bags and salt.
we 're going to give it to next.
now it 's tea bags for those who have not used teabags every cookie.
it gives a really nice rich dark color to the general right.
so we 've closed the pressure cooker.
we 're going to run some bread pressure builds up.
we 're going to let it bissell two or three times lower, the heat, and let it cook for about twenty minutes.
the pressure cooker generals are done in the pressure cooker.
let 's have a look.
well , yeah, the teabags really help.
so we 're going to do now is just take out the tea bags 'cause you do n't need those right after this.
and we have a bowl and just something to scoop out the general.
we 're going to separate the jenna from the liquid that there in and do n't throw away the liquid.
because we are going to use it, it 's a good way to tell if your jenna is cooked, properly is that you 'll notice.
there 's cracks and if it 's cracked, you know that it 's going to be soft on the inside.
and , you know, people have different preferences.
some people really like the jenna, you know, to hold shape.
some people like kamal mash down.
so it 's up to you if you like overly could turn out and just keep the pressure going on for a little bit longer.
but this is perfect for us because it 's still going to hold shape, and it 's cracking so.
we know it 's perfectly cooked and over here, we have a medium size skillet and put it on medium heat.
actually immediate too higher than medium.
and , we can put in the oil king.
once the oil is hot, we 're going to add in heat and quickly adding the tomatoes and mix.
and we 've used the canned tomatoes.
they have a really nice color and actually has, you know, a lot of nutrients packed in there.
but if you want to use fresh tomatoes that 's always right option.
also , now we going to allow this to cook and basically, the oil needs to separate from the tomatoes.
so we 're going to keep it on a little medium high, but keep an eye on it.
tomatoes for small there burn fast and second of all, it will splatter all over so you know, we have our hands.
yes , we 're going to do that and let 's see, you back.
we ended up covering are tomatoes because they were splattering all over the place.
but they 're cooked.
can see the oil is coming out from the side, then the perfect indication that the tomatoes are ready most dead you 're going to add in the dry spices.
now which china masala red chili powder technicolor dried mango powder, an alabama public in arizona, is actually pomegranate seeds.
so they have had a really nice kayley flavor, and as a really like a new dimension to this dish reviews store watch annam, asala and you can buy any brand and just, you know, just all the my little different.
but most of them are very good right alright dude i 'm going to head into the jenna 's brother charlie we have good mix and.
now what we 're going to do is we 've got sweetie that water from the truly that get boils and we 're going to keep adding that little at a time and let it just keep looking, it 's a little by little this liquid is going to get absorbed by the china and it 's going to make them really flavorful.
so while that 's cooking, we 're going to cover it one more time, and it will help all the flavors incorporate really well.
right let 's have a look.
we have actually been storing.
it , in the middle.
so it does n't you know, burn.
so dried up nicely and what i 'm going to do is just take the end of your special, i just press it in a little bit.
so that you know, everything just incorporates well, and china actually zorbs a little bit of the masallah, and there 's a little bit.
it forms a thick gravy right.
and we can go ahead and add a little more liquid bottom line is beginning, repeat this process.
so it 's not very great.
like right, so but the key is that as a liquid gets evaporated, it just concentrates the flavor and it 's so good cover again.
yeah , let 's have a look looks very good.
the color is awesome.
and we 're going to stop at this point over a little time and get a little dryer because the channels will keep absorbing the liquid.
and , you know, they still even after i turn it off it will dry up a little bit more.
so we 're going to keep it like this and when you serve this, you can have some sliced onions or green chilies.
and even some cilantro or coriander leaves and discard the top of it and will be delicious yes and also this same recipe can be used for.
