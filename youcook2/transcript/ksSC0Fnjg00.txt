yes , it is another beautiful day in hawaii name.
i 'm hungry for a sandwich today.
one of those vietnamese sandwiches that kind they make on french bread, let 's go make one of those.
this is it does n't.
that sandwich look good.
i visited a local french style bakery in honolulu to get these roles.
now there 's probably a bakery with bread like this, near you make an off color joke about this.
but i want this is a die con it 's basically a big white radish.
so i 've got this cool little japanese turning slicer see how it turns the diakon into curly thin little strands tried again with some carat, is n't that cool?
i like this actually better than shredded carrot, you know, i could make an off color joke about that.
but i want now a quick simple marinade with some rice vinegar, a little bit of sugar and some water.
we 're going to put that on the diakon and carrots and let it marinate for just a few minutes, meanwhile, slice the french bread roll slather on some vegan age that 's vegan mayonnaise.
this is vegetarian sliced ham.
and , here comes the marinated, diakon.
and carrot is starting to look like a vietnamese sandwich, and we top it off with some sprigs of chinese parsley also known as cilantro alright.
let 's go to ala moana park on a beautiful afternoon to let some folks test these sandwiches.
oh , this is good.
this is good really good, there.
the electorate ikonen there, and cucumber.
it 's really good.
i could make a half brother joke, but i won't.
