hairy wanna, i 'm katherine and welcome back to no spoons here today, we 're going to making tuna pasta salad.
it 's one of my favorite recipes to make super easy, and the best part is we 're not going to be using any measuring utensils.
so , let 's go ahead and get started.
you 'll need some elbow noodles.
olive oil salt pepper.
a few cans of tuna mayo, some dijon mustard and some diced red onion celery, and some cherry tomatoes.
so i already want to head.
and i cooked the AMA noodles.
and i left him a little bit.
because we 're going to be adding some tuna and some mustard and mail.
so we do n't want it if you have to put in your fridge for leftovers.
but after you do that you just go ahead and add in all your vegetables that we already cut up.
so those are tomatoes and celery and onions.
once you put in all, your vegetables were just going to add in our two cans of tuna, and if you do n't like to know, you can always use check into this can be a chicken pasta salad.
but i really like that you know, i think it has great flavor and lots of protein.
so that 's one and that 's too.
now that we have our main ingredients.
and then we 're just going to add the filler, which is the mustard and mayo.
so we 're going to start with them in my out, and this is just going to make it nice and creamy.
so to start with a little bit, and since we 're not using any measuring utensils just start with a little, you can always add more.
but once you add it in, and you ca n't take it back out.
so and add a little bit of mustard and then we 're going to mix it all together, and i love all the colors in here the red, and the green and the purple i think it looks absolutely great, and.
so fresh, so, once you have all of those things mixed together, you can give it a little taste test.
if you think it needs for mustard add more or if you want it to be creamy, radmore mail if you 're trying to make it healthier then do n't add as much mail and more mustard want to do that just add salt and pepper to taste.
it makes all this together too.
and the great thing about this is if you 're trying to cut back on carbs.
you actually do n't even need to add any noodles in here at all.
you can just do the tuna and make it into a really delicious healthy sandwich.
so they all boil is here.
because if you have any leftover is sometimes it can get a little bit, drawing if you just drizzle, olive oil on there and mix it all together it would be good as new.
but let 's go ahead and see how it taste perfect.
i really do love this recipe.
you saw how easy it was to make is so healthy.
it 's great to pack for a lunch and i really hope you give us a try, but that 's it for today.
thank you so much for watching.
