hi , i 'm diane cometa.
and today on dish with diane making pasta vazul pasta and bean soup this is an easy one pot meal that 's perfect for a weeknight, so.
let 's get started.
you need some canned cannellini beans some tomato sauce.
some ditalini, which is a small tube pasta.
dried bay leaf, some fresh garlic, and some chicken broth or, chicken stock.
you 're also going to need some celery carrots and onion and i have some fresh herbs here.
now i have some fresh rosemary, an fresh thyme, and i actually keep mine in the freezer.
after i purchase it an eye rapid in some foil and put it in a freezer safe bags, so whenever i needed i can just and take it out.
so that 's what i did today.
and another thing i have here, is some pancetta?
this is an italian bacon, and it 's diced really small.
if you do n't want to use this, you do n't have to you can either substitute and use some regular bacon.
that 's a little bit more fatty, though, or you can just leave this out.
i 've left it out plenty of times and it still tastes really good.
so , do n't worry about this part of it, and i have some salt pepper and olive oil now.
what we 're going to do first is take the celery carrot and onion.
and we 're going to.
i 'm going to put mine in my mini food processor here.
i 'm going to cut it off really small, so if you do n't have, one, just cut it up.
so i have to give it a rough chop.
first , before i put it in there almost forgot you want to put the garlic in there.
as well, so if you 're doing it by hand, just mince your garlic up really fine.
now i 'm going to go over this over i 'm going to get this whole thing started.
i have a pot heating over medium heat, and i 'm adding some olive oil in.
and now i 'm going to add in my pancetta, and you just want this to cook for a few minutes until the pancetta gets nice and brown.
the pancetta is nice and brown now, and you see all the little brown bits on the bottom.
that 's what you want.
that 's lots of flavor and the pancetta gives it a.
really , nice smoky taste.
so now what we 're going to do is add in the vegetables and the garlic so just put that in there.
and we 're going to put our herbs in, there as well.
add a little surround.
now there on the stems like that.
because we 're going to take those out at the end.
so you do n't want to chop them up or anything like that, you just leave them in their hole and then when we 're all done.
we just man come right back out its teams, up a little bit at first whoops.
there 's a character.
forget it did n't get chopped up.
get that out of there.
so this is just going to cook for a few minutes three minutes until it gets little soft.
and it 's nice and fragrant going to add a little bit of salt in there and some fresh pepper.
they just teasing this to taste and just give that a little quick star around.
and this is something that i 've made plenty of times on a week night, and i come home from work, and i just do it really quick and boom.
it 's done so.
now we 're ready for the next step, and i 'm going to add in the chicken broth.
you 're also going to add in your sauce at this point and the beans.
now just give that a star and then we 're going to raise the heat up to like medium high, and you 're going to bring this up to a boil.
an believe it or not we 're almost done.
OK , it started to boil an now.
i 'm going to add in the pasta, and you 're just going to let this cook for about ten minutes or until the pasta is tender.
then we 're ready to serve it up.
that was literally about thirty minutes.
altogether , so what i like to do is, i have some nice fresh crusty, italian bread here.
and i have some fresh parmesan cheese.
so i take my parmesan cheese.
and i just great that on the top.
and now it 's time for a little taste hope so that.
hot , but it 's really good.
i promise part.
my tongue, i think the one thing i want to tell you real quick is that when you 're cooking it make sure that you scrape the bottom a little bit.
because sometimes the beans will sit on the bottom.
when you 're boiling the pasta and you want to make sure that they do n't stick down there.
so just get your spatula or spoon, and just scrape that up real good.
but really delicious, rich and perfect for a week night, but you could certainly have this anytime you want.
it 's a wonderful comfort food, and we could use low sodium chicken broth.
they have now white pasta that has extra fiber in it, or you could use a whole wheat pasta.
so there 's lots of different like healthy options for you hear the recipe is on my website dishing with die dot com, and do n't forget to subscribe.
i 'd love to have you, i hope i made you like a little easier, more enjoyable and delicious bye, bye.
