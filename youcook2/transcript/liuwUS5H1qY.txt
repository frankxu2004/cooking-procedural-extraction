hey , it 's the frugal chef.
i 'm going to be skewering some shrimp today to put on the grill.
i want to show you how to make the marinade for this recipe.
and then will marinate it for couple hours.
then we 'll come back will secure it will put it on the grill.
OK , so what we 're going to need.
for this is an eighteen ounce jar of orange marmalade.
i 've already emptied it into my pan just by any type you want, we 're going to need four scallions, which has dropped here why it 's like greens and dreams will need six cloves of garlic, which i meant.
i have two jalapenos, which i seated an, i meant.
and i also have about half a bunch of cilantro, which it shop.
i have a quarter cup of soy sauce.
we 're going to use about three teaspoons of sesame E oil.
so what i 'm going to do now is, i 'm going to put on my ingredients in the pan.
i 'm just going to storage to restore it until my marmalade, melts that liquefies and then i 'm going to let it cool.
i 'll put it on the shrimp.
put it in the fridge for two, maybe three hours and then i 'll come back and will skewer it together and then.
so let me forget.
and i 'll see you in two hours OK alright my shrimp has been marinating for an hour and a half.
so , i 'm getting ready to secure it in about half hour.
so i 'm going to be using bamboo skewers.
i need to soak these for thirty minutes, because i do n't want him to catch fire on the grill.
so i 'm soaking these and i 'm going to leave him there for thirty minutes, and then we 'll come back and will skewer, shrink your thirty minutes.
OK , let 's go R.
X ray, of course, we have our boost yours that were soaking dice.
pineapple anar shrimp that 's been marinating and some bacon, so this is how we 're going to do this.
we 're going to start by securing the bacon at the bottom, kind of, fold it a little bit and put it in through like that thread it through the bacon.
OK , now we 're going to grab a piece of shrimp going to put it through, and then we 're going to grab some pineapple and put it through then you 're going to scoot on your stuff to the end of the skewer, and you 're going to thread your bacon again OK.
so now you need another piece of shrimp and another piece of pineapple, and you repeat, repeat and.
so on and.
so forth so you 're going to end up with a skewer looking like this.
so shrimp pineapple back.
entrance pineapple bacon, you started at this, and actually an now we 're going to put this on the grill, cook them and eat them, hey.
so we are going to cook the shrimp now, uh, peter has his grill, all cleaned up.
and he has the heat down to low.
we do n't wanna burn it, you know, shrimp cooks really fast so we need to get this, you know, fairly quickly, we skewered some with pineapple.
some with green peppers and some with just bacon that everybody can have what they like so, that is, a good, yeah, do n't, do n't forget the frugal chef dot com where you have all kinds of good frugal recipes.
