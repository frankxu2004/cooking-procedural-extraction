today , we 're going to be cooking japanese rahman so let 's get started.
firstly , we 're going to add two cups of water to a pot.
then we 're going to add two beef stock.
cubes nah started small fire, and we 're going to leave that part to dissolve the beef stock.
get a larger fire going on another bottom.
and we 're going to heat up some olive oil in a pan.
i 'm using quite a lot of oil here because this is going to form the base of our source later.
and i 'm going to season some beef by adding a lot of salt now.
this may look like a lot of salt.
but we 're going to add extra here.
so that when we add the meat to our soup that 's what will be the seasoning, and.
now i 'm just going to add some pepper and again.
we 're going to be adding extra pepper here.
now we 're going to add that meat to the pan.
i 've spread this up so that you do n't have to wait.
and once you meet is ready which is going to take that out of the pad and leave it to rest now to the oils remaining in the pan.
we 're going to add half of an onion that we 've dust.
one tablespoon of garlic half a teaspoon of ginger and then chili to taste.
i 'm using about one teaspoon here.
not just give that old good mixer going to brown the onions.
and once your onions looking brown, like mine were going to add some japanese barbecue sauce if you do n't have, japanese barbecue sauce, you can find it in the asian section of your grocery.
if you do n't have any on hand, you can just use soy sauce and add some chili and barbecue sauce to that.
now we 're just going to mix that in and let that cook once it 's mixed, and what we can take it off.
the heat and then move to pudding are noodles into this stock that we created earlier.
now we can just leave our noodles and move on to cutting out beef.
so just cut your beef into some thin slices like i 'm doing here.
i prefer my beef well done.
but it 's totally up to you.
what rarity that you use now that all of our ingredients are ready we can begin serving place.
your soup and noodles into a bowl careful not to splash them everywhere.
then go and bring that meat and place that on one side of the bowl and at any of the juices that have formed from when we rested that mate back into the soup.
now get the garlic barbecue onion mixture that we created earlier, and then spoon that, on top of the beef, and finally i 'm just going to add some spring into this.
but here you would be able to add any sort of vegetables that you like or even an egg and there we have it our rama noodles are done.
