hi guys, today, i 'm making shrimp and lobster tam, bora.
if you want to join with me, let 's begin.
there 's a vein on the bottom of this rim, when you cook it at tense of curls, up of this.
i like to keep my swim straight.
so i give it a few shallow cuts.
do you marinate this rim?
i 'm using half a teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of sugar.
one teaspoon of garlic powder, an half a teaspoon of ground pepper mix, well, and let it sit for fifteen minutes, you can also use lobster tail.
but it 's a challenge to remove the meat from the shell do small shallow cuts on the bottom, an marinade would salt sugar garlic powder and ground pepper.
these are for fry vegetables.
i have sweet potato.
zucchini add plan, onion and potato.
i 'm using tamara seafood pyramix.
it 's very easy just follow the instruction on the back of the package, let me show you how to find the shrimp.
pull the shrimp by the tail dip in the batter fry dish remand till it 's turned to golden.
when does rim is ready, put this rim on paper towels to absorb excess oil.
repeat the same steps with the lobster tails it 's almost done put the vegetables in the batter piece by piece.
i am to return to golden.
i 'm serving my swim and laughed at timberwood, pickled ginger sabora, dipping sauce, and was abby to make this little flower.
