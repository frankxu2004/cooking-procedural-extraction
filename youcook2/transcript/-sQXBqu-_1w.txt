now the chances are you 're watching this video, you looking for quick speedy dinner.
but you like the very basic kitchen skills.
so today i 'm going to all the tips and tricks to awesome knife skills that means you can shop without losing fingers.
and we 're going to create an incredible pork stir fried rice dish becaus, let 's face it, chimpanzee with an axe has better knife skills in you.
now , i can have a stir fry at home, at least once a week.
and it 's really easy so together.
yeah , and the only skill is getting everything ready ahead of cooking chopped up nice and fine and that it will look at the date, knife skills, yeah, OK, so, first up for port, which we need tamara, late this is tenderloin or pork loin.
and all i want to do is cut it into small strips.
the key here is a board that is going to move around a knife.
it 's nice and sharp and then just let the knife through the work as you slide through, if you got a nice sharp knife, it will do.
so you 're using the claw technique with the hand.
so , some behind the fingers and then all you 're doing is your knife, is sliding down that nail, and there 's no way you can cut your finger and meanwhile.
i 've on this side.
i 'm going to make a marinade for that pork, which is root.
ginger and a couple of close garlic blend it with some liquid, so in the marinade, what i 'm going to do is get with spice grinder.
i 'm just going to put.
sorry , that 's the salty flavor going in a shot of mirin, which is a sweet rice.
yeah , and, that is incredible.
now we 've got kind of the fiery heat of the ginger and the raw garlic going in as well, and that 's it simply that populate on blend it up.
and we 're going to marinate are pork in there, you can do that just for a few moments before you fry it.
why you cover with mister veg, or you can do it in the morning leave it all day and it be amazing to dinner.
typically , this machine would be for grinding spices or coffee beans or nuts.
but i find for paste and marinades is brilliant, too.
right now aw pretty strong.
could you gotta firing heat of ginger?
this is n't garlic that 's going to go in there or go pork in, and then just leave that to marinate for little, while we cut up for the veg and the keys would stir fries to make sure everything is about the same signs will get rid of the raw meat bored.
you clean your hands burst up red onion.
and we want to dice red onion cut into where the route was like that, but sort of three courses the way through.
remember the claw you keep your fingers back, and then turn it and go the other way, and what you 're left with here is it die.
so you minimize the ways to cut the bottom off, then the top off, then down one side and then carve will way around, i mean, all the seeds come out in one and then you can try something else into small matchstick like pieces do n't let knife leave the board you 're rocking back and forth and you end up with awesome little julian there 's are pepper onion done.
you could use much two at the moment there.
a little bit too big.
so the same thing use that rocking action, keep the knife on the board and just cut it into strips like that, and that way.
the strips will be on par with the pepper, and i 'm going to take tender stand broccoli, know this is already small.
threats are properly, but i 'm just going to cut them in half fit.
and they could just cut down this talk and just kind of tehran.
it 'll find its natural line.
you end up with pieces like that now.
the last thing we have to get ready before we start to cook is our rice.
we already have it ready because it 's leftover.
if you 're going to cook fresh cook yourself.
some rice and it 's just cooked.
then drain it layout a tray and let it cool down, and that allows it on steam dryers.
the walk has to be to the max, this bit, we love, yeah, coconut oil.
and that 's what we 're going to try.
and so you guys suggested it basically, couple reasons.
one i had a higher smoke point.
but also, just if you get a good quality oil, you get the coconut flavor coming through as well.
so with the ginger and the mirena coconut and all these veg, absolutely delicious hella combination.
do n't put it until your work is already hot, then when, that is, nice and hot the first thing to do is to car meets mostly body shot?
so high smell like suntan lotion is n't it, and then with it, and it has to be that why is chris, right.
but you 're doing this bit.
so stir fry you kinda wanna keep it moving.
smells unreal, and how long do i do this for before i take it out to do that.
if it 's hot enough, that 's almost cook because we cut the pork so fine.
let the soy and the ginger stuff will caramelize ing.
at this point want to screw the poor count.
but leave the oil in the walks that 's now.
but all the amazing porky flavor with a change in the mirror.
next up your onions go in.
and this is so easy so quick provider.
you 've got everything just to the side, you get all your crap done training is called me.
some class the, another top tip is if you say, anything that you 're doing in the kitchen in french makes it sound more skillful.
so tender stand broccoli and are rouge peppers.
the other great thing about stir fry is we 're not going to put this not really crunchy, you want the crunch of edge and then go to the right now.
the rice is cold.
so we need to get this time he all the way through your doing it perfectly.
but basically, scrapes right down to the bottom.
those bottom bits that will get court.
but with a something silicon, spatula or wooden spatula get under there straight and just mentioned instead other spectrums are, available when you 're happy that rice is hot all the way through back in with our pork and all those juices that come out of the pork and then source itself.
so simple a squeeze of sweet chilli sauce kind of a cheap.
but i absolutely love it.
i love sweet chili and something it with soy individual in the marinade.
but instead of putting in shorts and a little bit of soy source keep it moving make sure it 's piping hot.
and that 's it.
like less than five minutes to the surf way.
once you 've got all of its ready and there, we go a super speedy stir fry with your beginner, or not you can absolutely.
now this every time is a stir fried rice with pork thought.
it is a speedy evening dishes that are going to give a lesson into healthy users that completely separate video use a fork.
if you 're not comfortable that coconut oil just makes this i just take it to a different level entirely.
yes , there 's nothing else to say other than if, you know, someone out there.
like me who would benefit from watching this video.
