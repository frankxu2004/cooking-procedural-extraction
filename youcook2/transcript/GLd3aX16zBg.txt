good thanks for coming back to micro.
me apartment believe it or not a lot of grown adults, search on the internet for grilled cheese recipe.
yeah , now even though i feel that i was kind of pathetic today.
i am going to make a grilled cheese recipe for you, but not just any grilled cheese today.
we 're making a white trash grilled cheese sandwich, the best kind there is this is for you.
rich folks out there who never had to make your own meal growing up because your parents happen to be at the bar, having ryan cokes now.
i should also tell you that there are only three ingredients in this recipe.
so you and your university degree why you should be able to figure this one out, check it out we 're going to start with a non stick pan.
it 's coded with nice safe chemicals, medium low heat.
the first ingredient is going to be white bread now.
do n't go shopping for anything that says healthy whole grain low fat brown or god forbid and know?
if you 've never seen this brand, it 's called wonder.
bread , wonder bread fits all the great awesome qualities that make a white trash grilled cheese, sandwich, wonder bread, remember that graph this company is going to love me for boosting their sales thing.
we need is.
butter wait a second, did i say butter?
no scratch that we only use margarine here in scarborough.
if they ca n't keep enough of this yellow flavored oil on the shelves it 's just awesome.
now again, when buying margarine at the store for your white trash grilled cheese sandwich, do n't get anything that has a heart on it and do n't get anything like this based cell?
it 's just a gimmick trying to imitate the real good stuff.
lastly , and most importantly, is the cheese?
that kind of cheese we use for white trash grilled cheese sandwiches, is called processed cheese that rings?
it 's processed into something better than you 've ever tasted in your life.
they actually makes byproducts of real cheese with other awesome ingredients like oil MSG and starch form it into these slices that are handy to use.
and they last forever in your fridge.
now , you know, something is good for you when it can last three months in your fridge.
fucking hey let 's put this bread like this will take it a lot of people in the trailer parks.
what they like to do is just squash your grilled cheese down.
i do n't know why they use that technique.
so we 're just going to do it just to keep this recipe more traditional kids from all over the trailer park will come for grilled cheese that look this good if you want to know if your cheese is cooked in the middle.
take it and just left open the side here like this check that out say it 's melting.
that 's the great thing about this awesome cheese that melts faster, you can feed a bunch of trailer park kids really fast.
so it 's beautiful, and it 's ready.
so you take it, put it onto a cutting board take your best knife corner to corner.
then you get some dinner where.
now we 're just going to add some potato and vegetables to this meal, complete dinner for your pickles are the best vegetable ever, and i go great with grilled cheese.
now when you 're diving into the jar, do n't use a four three times will just use your hands.
because if you have any germs or bacteria or cuts on your hand that pickle juice is medicinal it 's going to be just clear everything, up, you know, just sort of wash it up little bit.
and i just really think about their dual purpose.
only some potatoes.
there 's another shopping tip for you use black diamond or kraft cheese slices.
they have the best oil wells and MSG factories on the planet, dude stop laughing.
because that 's an awesome, oh, yeah, try this cheese with your next wine and cheese tray at home, your guests are going to be blowing away.
