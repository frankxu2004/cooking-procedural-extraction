now it 's time for a little less and susan.
sadie is a cooking instructor and she and her husband used to own the polonaise restaurant in south utica.
now she teaches people how to cook high ices and sadie and i operate sissons cooking school, are you on my aunts runs back 'cause she says if i do it like this is how you look like putin?
and he 'll be assisting as we make perogies, one popular item that was on our menu, so the first thing.
we 're going to do is make the filling, and i like to use onions cooked in butter.
what 's better than onions cooked in bug, so will melt this butter which is looks like a lot.
but it 's a lot of filling that we 're making, and then we 'll add these onions and will cook them just until they are tender.
but not ground.
so that their soften up.
but you do n't see little dark specs and onion in the filling, so our butter is ready.
just add are onions, so with the butter ready to go.
the onions added in, they will be sauteed just until they are soft anwil, darius magically handles the sauteing, the onions will head over for the making of the filling and the dough with susan.
so here is our ingredients for our pirogue dough.
i have my flower in here.
we 're just using all purpose flour all purpose unbleached flour, and i 'm going to add my salt and what i like to do is mix my eggs with the water head of times.
it makes it much easier to make the dough.
so now i 'm going to just stir this in and what i 'm doing is incorporating all of my moistening all my flowers.
so that when i go to need it, it 's much easier to need the one that salted here now.
if when i 'm making this and this takes just experienced to know if the dough feels too wet, i can add a little bit more flour.
if it feels too dry, i can add a little bit more water, but do n't add too much.
you do n't want to wet dough.
usually this amount works pretty good, but if you 're making in the summer when it 's humid, it might be too wet.
you might need to add a little more.
usually , i mean, usually in my pasta, there 's more eggs to water that in this, this little more water.
the next, but yet it 's a really, it 's of pasta.
so now that 's ready to need.
i do n't need it very long for it 's not like when i make bread.
so this is i just like to need it for about a minute.
but just a little flower just to prevent it from sticking and when you 're kneading dough just kind of roll with the palm of your hand and fold over, and i always tell my students like when we 're making breads and stuff specially women whose arms and hands might not be as strong.
shoulders , you know, to get right behind it.
so i just want to make it smooth alright.
if you make your own perogy and eat them, you 'll lose weight because this is a workout.
it 's best to let this rest for about ten or fifteen minutes.
so that the gluten in the flour can relax and label, to roll out the dough without it bouncing back and, and stretching so.
i just cover it with a little flower.
i do n't want to mix this flower in.
but just to prevent it from sticking.
next up time to make the filling OK are, onions are already there are tender.
but not browned, well, it 's not a crime.
if you do brown them a little bit, it 's not going to hurt anything.
so will take these over to put two are potatoes and add them directly to our potatoes, potatoes are mashed with a reiser.
so that everything is completely match with no lumps.
and now we can add the rest of our ingredients.
i have are salt and pepper here and build your hearing that cheese, please car brand.
and , this is about a cup of ricotta cheese.
wherever here, and that 's all there is to our feeling now will.
just makes this stuff.
so , as soon as it mixes up, the filling her husband.
darius gives us a little lesson on the polish language and perrot guy, he says.
we 're mixed up pierogie, not pierogis.
it 's very plural.
it 's already plural so, once again.
we as americans americanize.
so if you 're having perogies for dinner that obvious you 're going to have to get augie i 'm going to have perogies.
so you learn something new, everyday.
so we 'll take a hunk of ardo here and first, i like to just spread it out with the heel of my hand and i just want to make sure that your dough is not sticking to your account, or you do n't want to use excessive flower.
but you want to make sure that you not blowing it to your table, then it causes problems, and i 'm just going to roll it to an even thickness, and, you know, the thickness is can vary if you like a lot of dough, you can roll your 's a little thicker.
i would say probably roll it to about an eighth of an inch so.
it 's kind of hard to measure.
you just keep lifting it and make sure it 's not sticking so you roll your dough out till it 's nice and thin.
and then you grab your paroki tool from quick cut in the mohawk, and you cut out your circles plant, you 're cutter quick twist and a little flick helps to separate it and pick up your scraps as these can be used to make more pure O.
and we 're going to use them to make our dessert today, also.
OK , i 'm going to take my scooper, put up.
let 's see, it 's nice and cold and the butter in there, gets burned to in it and see how it 's holding its shape, which really helps when you go to fill these.
so each disk gets a scoop of the filling and then it 's time for a little bit of finesse.
so , take put a little flower on your fingertips.
their him so they wo n't stick.
no worry about it, it 's not going to.
and are you right handed.
i hope i can do it together.
so put let these sit on your right hand, then take your index finger of your other hand in your thumb and kind of put this finger down to just hold it, and then just kind of R two and just stretch it over the top first.
yeah , and try not to squish it.
like , yeah, that 's alright and then gently push a little bit to the site and then do one side set, and then do the other side push that in a little bit yeah.
so that you have dole wando and then.
so you can actually stretch the dough over a little bit.
so that, that way you do n't have the filling in the way so, i 'm OK.
now so you do n't want to fish shaped eroge.
so now you can kind of pump it up and then squeeze it up.
so that you can kind of shape it a little more, after you 're done, you might try another one.
i am alright here.
we go that 's good and yet another thing you can do is.
if you 're so, those little sticky, you can actually slide the bottom line a little flower too, and it 'll help and you might have your own method mine works for me.
but you know, whatever works.
but basically you want to seal the top person you can actually stretch this toll free taxi, and then, then do the size and anyway it helps keep your shape.
also , that 's it and the reason, again that you do n't want the filling is stuck in between cell open up in the water and you have a big mess.
so , after all said and done.
it 's time to boil, and they come to the top.
and they float there basically done.
then they go to the frying pan, along with onions in butter and there.
you have it, and a little sour cream with it as well, i 'm assuming, yeah, or a lot of summer green that 's awesome i is.
so good and it 's.
so different than 'cause.
i love cronies are.
OK , i thought something there.
you go pierre augie.
not pierogis, sorry, plural.
so there you have it delicious authentic homemade perogy.
not perot keys pierogie, not pierogis, asari, plural.
