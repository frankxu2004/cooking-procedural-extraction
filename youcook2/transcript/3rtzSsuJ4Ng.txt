recipe that i, you need some bacon some braid some lettuce and tomato here.
i 've got two.
anchovy , fillets, which i 've chopped up the juice of half a lemon, a quarter cup of olive oil two teaspoons of dijon mustard, a clove of garlic, and the yolk of one egg.
now put all of the ingredients in the description bar guys.
so check that out name until mixer.
i 'm going to add the egg.
the dijon mustard, the anchovies, the clove of garlic and the lemon juice, now know the mixmasters, overkill for such a small quantity, so you came whiskered.
if you want now, you just want to blend this for about two or.
so minutes until it 's nice and smooth and then slowly adding that olive oil until you 've got a nice, thick and creamy mixture like this now.
just set that to one side going to fry up some bacon.
now you want to follow this up to looks.
nice and crispy, then i 'm just going to take it off onto some paper towel to dry.
and , and we put together our sandwich now.
i have toasted bread.
he guys, and i 'm going to put that bacon on.
then , some tomato.
and then some of that lovely caesar dressing now.
you can use mine eyes if you like you guys, and you can spread it on the bottom piece of toast if you like to.
but i like to throw it on top of the tomatoes absolutely beautiful, stuff, that says addressing two guys using a caesar salad it is awesome.
