what is the cooking with steve and jerry today?
we 're going to show you how to make actual onion rings that are bred.
it taste like you get in the shop, the shepherd on it, says we 're going to, we 're going to show you how to make onion rings to taste like just like.
what you get at an actual fast food place cat name.
but one popular ones they 'll be better anyway much better cheers, cheers, but you 're going to need for this recipe.
it 's pretty simple.
you need onions do n't put them in your eyes.
y'all try because it will hurt you right, and egg, and egg anything.
you 're going to need one and one quarter cups of flower that 's not one in two thirds by the way that 's one and one week order.
and we 're going to need one cup of milk to go with the egg bread crumbs.
deep fryers set to three hundred and sixty five degrees.
fahrenheit , however, if you do n't have a deep fryer, you could probably get away with doing this in a really big pot full of oil, you could have a fire extinguisher, have the few mode on and make sure you have a first aid kit and have to, first aid kit move around off cheered.
scarce , so first thing you 're going to want to do is take a sharp knife.
and , and anya.
and you 're going to want to slice this onion.
but a quarter inch thick all the way down, do n't stick your face too close.
because you will cry quarter inch thick about after that you 're going to want to separate them into rings, the very fine job.
that 's why they 're called onion rings, and i 'm onion packs onion.
are they making you cry?
yes , onions completely separated alright.
so what we 're going to need a cup and a quarter of clean white flower you can get it from the food bank, and you put that in a mixing bowl with that.
we 're going to take a heaping, teaspoon of baking soda baking powder, baking powder.
see i knew i messed that up too, baking powder and a teaspoon of salt.
and it goes any old salt will do OK, and will mix that all up it looks nice you did wash your hands right.
gotta take those onion rings and coat them in that flower mixtures.
we are going to do.
next step alright.
so onions were put in a bowl with lid, and we shook him up, encoded them in flour mixture and stuff like that.
so now we 're just going to take him out of the flower and do n't men another bowl that has no flowering next step.
we take our one cup of milk.
we take our cock-a-doodle-doo, then we normally would throw the eggshell at steve, but will put it into service.
you mean, compost eggbeater.
if you do n't have one of these by wine there a dollar, or he 's a fork or you support we 're actually going to pour it into the bowl with our flour mixture.
oh , yeah, i like sound effects, and we 're going to take our egg beater that we use them.
we just mess it up so it 's kind of like pancake batter.
yes , it is you are all mixed up now.
we 're going to pour this batter, hit this bowl full of onions alright so you 've got your onions in your batter in the bolton.
now you 've got to mix them up in code, all the onions, which is this is so fun.
all right, now you got your onions code in this better, and is ready to go into the breadcrumbs.
try command red amount so i can hear it right now.
it wants some onion rings in there, burn myself a little bit, anyway, you can gauge by your deep fryer or boiling pot of oil as your financial circumstances may allow.
but we can ruin our onion segments into the deep fryer going to drop them right.
so do n't forget when you 're cooking your onion rings in your deep fryer pot full of oil, whatever you gotta, flip these bad boys 'cause they 'll only cook on one side.
why is that.
because they float steve.
so this is what your end product is going to look like nice crispy, goldie brown onion ring engineering, that 's right, yeah, making onion rings?
fear is, well that sounds crunchy.
L sound so crunchy, very crunchy.
right on, and you can season these bad boys up if you want with the lowest form of sized it does n't even have a company name.
it 's just seasoning salt, which is already the lowest form of seasoning.
but we end up with these drive in fast food, restaurant style, crispy onion rings, and these have been out of the deep breath for a bit.
but watch this, see how time.
i want to nice ten minutes after being deep fried.
those things crunch.
