have a tablespoon of sugar, half a teaspoon of mid in half a tablespoon of saki, and i added actually half a teaspoon of beef stock mix and some hot chili oil and this?
you do n't really need to add this.
i added two tablespoons of this to kind of make the sauce a little bit milder.
if you do n't have this, you do n't need to add it, the wishes.
share is pretty much the main flavors so actually.
no , it, at this, it makes it a little milder and it takes a lot better.
so , that is, what we need for the sauce.
an issue, come out like this, so the first thing you want to do is just cook your chicken.
i initially wanted to use torque, but when i went to team cheating, have any of the life forms that i usually used for chevy shutters?
so i did n't want to bite each chunk.
of course, so i 'm just leaving chick in you can use whatever, i mean, so i just took off the chick in an now.
i 'm just gonna add in some onions.
well , when i brought to see an add white pepper and salt to the chicken S seasoning and you can just do the same with the other vegetables.
now this abbott garlic and the mushrooms and just cook until the vegetables are tender.
so i 'm just going to add in the bean sprouts.
i 'm gonna add in the noodles, which i already precooked now you can use any kind of noodles you like.
either gone or the yucky, soba noodles and then just for lips like a chick in you probably did n't need all that sauce.
but just click it a little bit more.
and it should be ready to eat you guys.
so this is what it looks like efforts being cooked just as a note.
the sauce that i made and what i showed you was n't the actual amount i 've already used it from another dish also.
i was watching TV, so, please do not add all of that sauce all you need is just a little bit just to flavor it.
please do not add all of this loss and so just to finish this dish.
all we need is some now you can add mail.
if you like you can japanese mail, oh, dear god, and, then all you need is some.
i will know D and some kutsal just in the middle.
some naughty, some green onions and some vinny, shoga, and, that is how i make pepsi.
