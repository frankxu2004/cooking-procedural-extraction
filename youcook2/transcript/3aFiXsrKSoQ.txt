hey guys welcome back to DDS matt rainey kitchen.
today , we 're going to be making one of the traditional favourites of mediterranean and middle eastern cuisine.
yes , we 're making shish, kabobs there, easy.
there 's simple you can grill on, we can make him in the summertime.
you can make him in the winter time anytime.
you want you can make shish, kabobs now get this recipe.
and all of my other mediterranean recipes on my website at DD med dot com.
you can join my twitter, you can join my facebook if you can chit chat kind of people who like mediterranean food.
now we 're going to go over the ingredients and show you how to put it together.
now the ingredients are pretty simple.
we have some green peppers, cut into an ice cubes.
red pepper tomatoes onions, your have your skewers which means sheesh that 's where the word shish, kabob comes from this is the shish.
an i have some filet mignon that 's cubed up into nice size pieces.
i like to use filet because it 's leenane.
it 's very tender.
we have some salt, black pepper, and of course, seven spices now some people like to use steel.
skewers are aluminum skewers and some people like to use wood skewers which years are.
so much easier.
because you could throw away when you 're done.
but you need to remember is if you 're going to use with yours make sure you soak them in water before you use them that way the wood wo n't burn, while you 're barbecuing the shish, kabobs.
now if you do n't want to get filet and i know you 're probably thinking, oh, my god DD.
we well, worth it.
but if you do n't use filet trying to use another meet that a little bit marble E with some fat.
because other meats are n't as tender as a filet.
so you 're going to need the fat and the other means to keep the meat tender chuck would be too dry.
try using thime like me.
maybe the back need any kind of meat that has a little bit of fat, too.
it would go great if you 're going to use the filet.
you do n't need to have a lot of fat in the meat because the filet itself now we have our vegetables that are cubed.
some people also like to use mushrooms different kinds of vegetables.
whatever vegetable, you like you can put it in between the meat as a barbecue.
we have our filet that 's cubed.
i 'm going to add about a teaspoon and a half of salt just like that going to add some fresh black pepper, trying to use fresh black pepper, it has a much more flavorful taste that if you get a ground already, and these are pretty cheap in get him at any store for a couple bucks.
so just, like that, we also add teaspoon or two seven spices sense prices gives it a nice worldly flavor.
i 'm also going to add just some olive oil.
it helps them eat brown nice and crispy, while it 's on the grill.
just a couple tablespoons of olive oil and now we 're going to make this up.
yes , use your hands OK to use your hands if you do n't like using your hands and just wear gloves.
why are cooking with the meat just like the, and then we 're going to do they were going to alternate the chunk of meat with a chunk of vegetable.
now at this point?
you want to make sure your grill is preheating you want on a medium high heat because this is very tender meat.
so you 're going to cook it just like you would cook a filet steak.
if you like in medium rare, you can cook it medium rare.
so i 'm going to leave about an inch at the end of this cure, poking your meat.
i 'm going to use a piece of onion having to put it 's all up to you can put alternate meat.
vegetable , meat vegetable you can do two pieces of meat, one piece of vegetable whatever you like so just like that see.
put it on a plate.
and then we can do some peppers and this one screen pepper, and these are nice christmassy colors, too.
so if it 's around christmas time you can use the red and the green see christmas cards kind of fun green pepper.
put another piece of meat just like that see.
how pretty, that is.
so you just keep going until you 're done and then when you want to barbecue them you want to barbecue them if you like them.
medium while you want to do about seven minutes on each.
side , if you like it medium rare, you want to do about five minutes on each side, so just, like that, i 'm going to finish these up.
and i wanna barbecue.
them , i 'm gonna show, you how to play from up.
we are done grilling i want you to take a.
i just serve them over some pita bread, you 're going to sue them over some brown rice with the vermicelli, noodles at recipes on my website, as well, see how to get all nice and grilled.
so that comes apart.
