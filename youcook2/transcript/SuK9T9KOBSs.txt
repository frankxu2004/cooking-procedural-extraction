welcome back to freedom regina today.
we 're going to be making volotea beans.
they are the dry ones that need to be solved overnight.
they 're wonderful for beautiful hearty meal.
specially , when it 's called this is.
what they look like so we need to have this working overnight configure water.
so i 've had mine soaking, and then the next day, you just drying their board and put some clean watering.
and you just boil them gently.
it should take about an hour and a half.
something like that you 'll know when did tinder they taste yummy.
OK , this is very bland.
there 's nothing in there just water.
and a bit of salt splitting a little bit, let me sit there.
so i 'm just going to taste a little bit OK, good.
so this, already that 's all we need to do with this money at the moment.
so are we just going to get the source ready down.
so we 're going to get the tomatoes ready.
i 've used fresh tomatoes this time.
so we 're going to chop, it might not taking out the seeds do n't ask me.
why , because that 's what we used to do and now i 'm speaking with that, just cutting into tiny little pieces.
then why you, you get less of the skin.
nobody likes the skin on the tomatoes always use beautiful ripe tomatoes when you 're cooking them.
there 's nothing worse than having green tomatoes.
the source will be very acidic so it wo n't be nice now.
when i have lots of commanders that are very ripe.
this what i do i chop them up like this and freeze them from when i need, them.
'cause when you 're cooking.
italian , you 're gonna need a lot certain.
it 's always wait start with an onion.
my grandmother used to chop them up in her hands and there was just like this.
i think it beats any chopping board.
we have one other ingredient in this today, we going to use some chorizo.
it 's delicious is very, very spicy.
full of flavor.
so you do n't need a lot.
this is plenty.
we just need it for flavoring if you ca n't get this, you can always use some spec just that i do n't know about a hundred grams or something like that, and you just chop it up with the same.
so i 'm just going to chalk this up slice.
it you can either take the skin off or leave it on whatever you prefer.
now , the other ingredient that would go well with this is also celery.
if you happen to have any line around, and today, i have so it 's going in.
that 's too sick.
i can just do it like that, and i could smell.
it 's always we start with pulling the olive oil in the pain always covering the bottom of the pan and after we get onion in, it 's nice and hot family just left in garnizon , golden.
the next thing we 're going to drop in is the chorizo, all we need to do with this one.
just actually only just simulate then we have the fire on medium so it 's not gonna cook very violently, so here.
we go this is nicely seal.
now i 'm going to put the salary in and make sure that you always use the tender pieces of the salary like the, the pieces on the inside, put that in this smells divine put a little bit of salt just put about half a teaspoon, becaus, witcher, it is quite tasty.
now one of the key things in cooking.
is you never ever put too much salt always?
put a little bit at a time and keep tasting now.
we 're just waiting for the onion to be translucent, and the celery half cooked at least near ago that ritter is nicely copter.
they do n't take long to cook anyway.
this all done all we need to do.
now is just put the tomatoes once the tomorrow 's in the old nicely cooked will add a little water in ten minutes.
it should be ready.
beautiful , this is really, i do n't think it needs a new water.
usually i need to put a little bit of water be cause it cooks too much tomorrow.
but today it did n't beautiful.
this is ready for the beans.
now you can see that the mothers all nicely cooked.
the skins are all out there.
never gonna put the bin thing now, they do n't have to be fully drained for this next step as much as he came from with the label.
and just pop them in.
but we do want a little bit more liquid.
this does n't have to cook anymore.
this is just the way justin mixing, and blending.
and we 're trying to get the right moisture in here.
we do n't want it to be too dry because when we put the pastor, then it 'll become dry across this past double soak up.
some of the liquid.
maybe i should have put it into the other pot, which i think i will do this is a little bit small cause it does n't give you any room to put the pastoring.
i kind of the process ready, so all we gotta do, is just put it in, and blend everything together.
we do n't want to drain it because we do n't want it to be to drive.
so i 'm only going to spend it on with this mix.
it all through, and it 's ready if it gets a little bit to drive and you can add a bit of water that we saved.
or if you did n't save it, you can use a bit of the water from the past.
now , every time i cook this, reminds me of the song.
did , some more, you know, that, that did n't mountains, is past efforts?
all this is the dish and it is absolutely beautiful.
it 's better, making drew.
and you 're going to want more an more special a cold winters night there.
