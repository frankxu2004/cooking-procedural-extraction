to die on nickos.
kitchen these onion rings are going to be some of the best you 've ever had.
we 're making my deep fried onion rings.
so , first of all, we 're going to make our better.
and this is really, really simple and super tasty, just into a large bowl.
i 've got some plain flour that i 'm going to be adding in.
i 'm going to season the flour with some salt and pepper.
now this next ingredient is n't just for flavor.
it 's for color, as well.
and i 've got some curry powder.
and i 'm just going to add in some carry powder and it just gives the better a wonderful color.
but also some great flavor.
it does n't overdo it with the heat.
it 's extremely mild work.
mix the flare around just make a well in the middle.
now we 're going to be cracking one egg straight in now.
next , i 'm going to be adding in some side are.
now if you wanted to use beer, you could i actually really love, the crisp flavor of cider.
if you want a non alcoholic version just use some soda water.
you want it nice and bubbly that 's going to give our better some nice airiness to it and make.
sure , make sure whatever you 're using it is ice cold.
so , just using the whisk, we just want to give this a good mix around.
and , that is exactly what i 'm after it 's, not so thick.
so , of course, we 've got some onions that i 've just cut into rings.
and all we want to do is just cover them in that better.
and now we can deep fry them to deep fry heat up some vegetable oil or use a deep fryer carefully placing the onion rings and fries for one minute or until crispy and golden brown drain the excess oil on a paper towel and serve immediately.
now all we have to do is get stuck into these bad boys.
so like i said before just love the color of these, and what the carry powder actually does not just for flavor.
but also for looks as, well, i love, love the color of 'em.
so beautiful and crispy spice, really well, and that side up, really, really goes, well.
but like i said, if you want to use soda water and have them non alcoholic go for it.
because essentially what you want is some bubbles in there you want something that 's going to give that better and nice crispy texture please give these ago, they will not well let me tell you, put some of these bad daddys down and they 'll be gone in no time.
