hello , number stays salamullah comes as trickle, welcome back to another session with your washer fat.
whatever dot, com today, i 'm going to make another favorite dish of mine dollar usually traditionally these dishes made with pork.
but today, i 'm going to use lamp to make this dish to make this window.
lou , first, we need to make the spice mixture to make this spice mixture.
i 've got red chillies is here.
i 'm using this big red chillies.
these red chilies add more of a color and a very nice flavor rather than hottness.
so if you want nice red colored, you can add these kind of red chillies.
add a small piece of cinnamon sticks.
few pieces of club and piece of cardamom.
if you want add khuman seeds off a teaspoon of a teaspoon of mustard seeds.
few pepper around six seven pieces of a club a small piece of ginger, add vinegar.
just we 're going to let this soak in this vinegar, half a teaspoon of sugar and traditionally they use funny to make this window lou.
but i 'm going to use a little bit of coconut milk.
these also gives a kind of a very good effect to your gravy.
add a little bit of coconut milk.
but if you want to add funny, even half a cup of wine will add a nice flavor to this.
so called these ingredients for at least thirty minutes make an ice based out of this.
now to this lamp.
what i did.
is i got the lamb with little bit flat on it that 's OK.
because traditionally these dishes made with poke, and i 'm today using lamb instead of it?
you can just add a little bit salt and also if you want to add any meat tenderizer you can add.
i have little bit of green papaya paste.
let me tell you once again.
this is only to make your meat tender and then just mix and leave it for one hour after which we 're going to adam chili paste after leaving it for one hour.
you can add this chili paste, what i did.
now you can see how read this is this gives a very nice flavor to your meat.
also , if you test this marinate, it will be like sweets are and a lot of spicy now.
let this meat rest for another three four hours.
that 's when this all this by this meet, then, we 're going to make this awesome lamp after marinating the meat for almost four hours, i 'm going to cook it now, add two tablespoons of oil i 'm just going to squeeze out the juices little bit, and just add made to this hot oil, just let it cook in the oil in a medium flame sorted this meat for another five minutes.
window is one of the most misunderstood dish even by the chefs lot of people.
what they do is they make nice red lamb curry in which the add potatoes.
and they call it lamp.
in download does n't mean ahlu window is basically a portuguese dish which has been in deionized by going and they call it when download now.
add one small onion finely chopped.
make sure you finally chop this onion, and mix it up.
i 've got some of this source left in my ball.
i 'm going to add this also to this now.
this already looks like an awesome gravy, but is going to become a very nice gravy.
after you cook, it just cover it up with a lid and let it cook it is going to take around thirty to forty minutes to make this cookie to a point in this meat is tender and this oil oozes out from this dish.
that 's when this becomes an excellent window after fifteen minutes.
you can see that this meat is cooking.
i kept the flame at low, so you can see these nice bubbles coming up, let it cook in a slow flame for a little longer time.
recently , i was in go, and i tried window at three different restaurants.
and each restaurant had a different kind of flavor different kind of test.
usually this is not as red as what i 'm showing.
it is slightly little.
in color are used to eating window which is reddish in color.
so i 've used chili 's that give more color and less of heat i thought the meat will be cooked in thirty minutes.
but it took more than forty five minutes, but look at this gravy, volvo just awesome lambert, so cook perfect even with the flavors you can.
still this you 're cooking something really, really special, oh, my god, oh, my god, you.
gotta look at this sauce.
what is SOS, watercolor while even the meat is.
so tender, hi, i 'm going to have a feast of cohen foot today ha, ha window is definitely one of my favorite, and i 'm telling you all over the world?
they go crazy about this window, but very fuel chefs and very few restaurants make this perfect difference.
you have to try this, if you eat poke, you better try to info otherwise you can use.
lamb if you 're cooking with chicken.
make sure you cook this gravy.
separately , then add chicken.
otherwise , the chicken will be cooked and the source will not be asked.
but when you cook it with lambert folk you get the source as well as this meat cooked to perfection.
