most people know that fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants.
but did, you know that, whole grains are often even better source of these key nutrients and the keyword is whole.
highly processed foods like most breads and crackers and cookies and pastas, and pastries can lead to weight gain and inflammation.
eat whole grains instead whole brains can actually help you control your weight, lower blood pressure and lower your risk for diabetes and stroke.
today , i 'm adding whole grains to my easy, and filling pase, pozzoli.
is cheppindi approved and coming up later in the show today i 'm making pasta F azzoli or pasta, and bean soup?
it 's a very quick easy one pot recipe.
i think you 're going to love, and it 's so simple.
watch , this is a fennel bulb.
these are fennel fronds and you can eat the whole thing.
and i 'm going to use the frans for garnish and the bulb just like it was celery.
it 's a lot like celery except it 's a little sweeter.
you just take the ribs off those are ribs just like celery ribs.
and then you divide the fennel bulb in half and take out the little bit of root that 's there.
because that 's kind of bitter and hard to digest.
and then you just die.
so this is going to be that flavor in the broth that the pasta our food is madison ingredient, is going to absorb.
so i 'm just going to add this to the fennel.
i already chopped and we 're going to go to the stove and saute this.
just so it softens i had a little bit of olive oil and then the fennel it 's going to soften and now we 'll do our garlic.
turn the head of garlic, down pressed with the hue of your hand.
now i 'm going to release the anti oxidant in the garlic clove just by smashing it.
the skin comes off and allison.
the chemical that makes garlic smell like garlic and gives its antioxidant power is released you only need a couple of cloves of garlic for this.
i like to cream the garlic.
because you get the most flavor and the most allison out of it, which of course is the active chemical that helps reduce stiffening and hardening of the arteries and just going to scoop this into the fennel, which is already sauteing we 're going to add our vegetable broth and whole wheat, first, it is going to suck up the flavor of the vegetable broth.
the flavor of the federal and the flavor of the garlic and now we have the rest of our favorite ingredients diced roasted organic tomatoes.
some organic frozen peas organic navy beans rich in protein.
good vegetable juice.
i like to add a few extra red pepper flakes.
i already have one made though beautiful feta cheese, right on top and the leaves of the fennel plant right on top.
