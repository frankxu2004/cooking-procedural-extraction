like this is tony from cooking around welcome again to my kitchen.
today , i 'm going to be something very hard and very special, a cottage pie.
now i do n't do it typically.
the same way as a lot of people do n't.
i do n't use the cheese 'cause.
i want the flavor of the meat to come out so i have all these goodies here and let 's get started.
this is going to be right here.
we go we have our pad already hot.
we had about two tablespoons of oil, and i take two medium on insta, diced.
and i prepared sure that all well, now i have a point on medium high, well, i 'm just let that cook for about seven in the lab.
and two medium carrots diced and about a stock of.
and now about a quarter cup of butter now you can use more butter for this.
recipe , if you want and about at this point of salt just to help it come along before they just want to bother to melts and infuse into the vegetables.
but i do not want to over cook village.
now you can see the vegetables right now to softened and what i basically do is turn up the heat and remove the second.
the pan heated up again.
i took the vegetables promoter site and now i 've got to do something.
really , really naughty.
now you do n't have to do this, but it is that real extra off and taste in the meat i 'm using a tablespoon pig fat.
yes , pure pig fat.
i know a lot of use are there saying, oh, i 'm so, goodbye then supported high cholesterol.
will not something you 're right.
but if you do n't want to use that just put two tablespoons of words.
so now we 're going to let this heat up OK.
now i have to hear about eight hundred grams of ground beef an i had them ground, especially for me, i chose the beef with a medium fat content in it give it some way where you can use lean.
but you 're not going to get that nice texture taste as if you would use the medium.
so it 's up to you.
so for that in there and we bro, do n't worry about it written on the bottom is all good and, and they keep on will be back around our meeting by themselves is becoming strapped.
now you can see that the meat is all brown.
but still if you look here, there 's too much liquid, and i 'm going to remove this liquid right.
now by pulling a little talk and remove the liquid, OK one of the liquid here is still some there.
so i 'm just going to cook for another three to five minutes just to take the rest of the liquid from the bottom.
now you can leave it if you want, i like to do it this way, and.
now we have three hundred milligrams of beef stock now, this is only half the other half is on the side and how to get the best quality?
you spot you can or just dissolve a couple of cubes into one water and.
now i put that on give it a nice stir, is liquid on the bottom again.
but it 's the liquid that i want.
point , and now we go back to our vegetables on that site and we put them all back in sight and now easter that are out now.
how is that college pie started boxing bell around?
now , i 'm going to add about a tablespoon of lea in paris, or you can add which is your sauce whichever.
one you want, and i put about tablespoon.
i have all what the heck, i want it stir that around roy start ever looking good, and now the famous, famous has her.
i would say about a teaspoon of pepper and about a teaspoon of time.
now you can add more, or you can not less.
and now you grab the rest of half of the each stock.
can you add about one tablespoon white flour or corn flour, and i want you to wish that really, really well, and then i want you to take that and put that into your mixture just like that?
how is that stackable now?
it 's important for the taste test for salt so you got a little here and remember again what i said, this is for you, not for me.
and we did, you know, i think it 's just perfect and will not have any more salt or anything else now you can add other herbs and spices.
you want to hear you can add a little bit of hot sauce if you.
want , but i 'm just going to make it natural like this, and the hot sauce later, autumn individual plate, just in case.
my guests do n't like it at home, so that what i do is, i add some parsley.
now you do n't have to put parsley lose recipe because it really does n't call for parsing.
but , you know, something i like the new trees and vitamins.
that kind of the parsley, plus it gives it a nice look.
so i just, but like i said, you do n't have to.
so that 's about half.
a cup of fresh firstly, i use korando that 's my favorite type.
and now we just turn off the heat and we put this decided wanted.
stitch , OK, we 're back i have here about a kilo of potatoes.
it shows the starch type of potatoes.
because we 're going to make mashed potatoes.
so they were boiled until they 're softened, and.
now we take our handy dandy little measure.
and we just make one complete circle around picture of all smashed and now i had about a quarter cup of butter about a teaspoon of salt and again.
the famous ground pepper about three quarters of a teaspoon to it, whatever you like.
and now we just move that when more time around to get everything mixed now, if you want, the potatoes a little bit more solved just add a little bit of milk and depends on your potato depends on how sexy wife.
for this recipe.
i do n't want to end any milk.
i wanted the potato stick.
now i 'll pick your handy dandy spoon and give it a good, good sternal.
that is, now right.
we are i got my baking dish.
i 'm using class for me.
it 's easier to wash, but you can use metal, or you can use a design addition, too.
if you want.
so here it is an.
now we take our mixture here that we did have the meat that all inside i love the smell of leading perry 's mixing with the needs and a car for them around and trying to be dentist even as possible, this is the way i like to do things and try not to be too perfect in the kitchen.
because the kitchen is another place for perfectionists.
now it 's done and.
now we take are mashed potatoes.
and we put that inside now, this recipe is very, very special for me.
it is my recipe and i know.
recipe , because i basically stole it from my friend demon, well, mouth, which he is a chef.
a great chef in cyprus, which i will add the link to his restaurant at the end of this video, and he 's the one that came up with this recipe, and like i said, it was generous enough to leave the door open.
and i went through the door, and i took his recipe.
you might be a little upset with me.
because the world i think with bacon fat in it recipe does not call for that.
but might be a bit of a troublemaker at this point.
you can add cheese topography watch.
i 'm not going to any cheese.
i like it just the way.
it is now at this point.
i like to take my fork and just basically i like to run it like this on top and the reason is for some reason.
it makes it more crispy.
and then the size, i just talk into sites like this.
there we have it now.
my oven is preheated to three hundred, and twenty five degrees.
it is a gas stove and when i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to leave it in there for forty minutes, and we will be back right out of the oven.
so what we 're going to do.
now is, we 're just going to let it cool down before i say about thirty minutes before we cut it now.
if you want to talk to be a little bit more brown, just open the top grill off.
but i like it like this, just wanted tips start to turn brown 'cause i do n't like too much.
christmas on the top, but then again that 's what i like.
whatever you like.
and now just to top it off it take some nice parsley.
and just sprinkle the talk like that now how this that look on diversification absolutely awesome so enjoy and thank you for being with me.
and i hope to see you again on my next rest.
