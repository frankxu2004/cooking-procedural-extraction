so today we 're going to cook korean bogle game.
so today we 're going to use a federate state, or you can also use skirt.
these are relatively cheap cuts and that creative people years.
because the soy marinade that we 're going to make, to make people go overpowers the flavor of beef.
so you do n't need to waste your money buying expensive server in for this dish for the marinade, or we need spread.
it would be easy.
is spring onion finely chopped?
spring onion finely chopped almonds garlic A touch of sugar, and pear salt pepper sesame E oil, and.
so now we 're going to make the marinade, starting with three tablespoons of soy sauce.
one two three about one and a half tablespoon of sesame oil is korean sesame E.
oil very, very full flavor.
so one there we go then if we, some sugar.
so about the same.
so one and a half tablespoons of sugar it makes it around spring onion.
finely chops i tend to use quite a lot of this.
but maybe two tablespoons or something like that there is in the world, and then i ai n't koreans.
got happy with about it, but maybe might want to use it up, but this is quite over, garlic so it 's about one oh, two full tablespoons.
we 're gonna do is.
we 're going to great two pairs items like my wolverine quite sweet.
there 's a lot of creative also use pair, juice, or apple juice.
i prefer to use fresh pair so light using fresh.
i like pair great sound at the end, meet, and makes it sort of so then you gotta really kind of gourmet turn the flavor comment.
he would be great that would end.
i regard really nice sorry background.
i 'm now, so you thief the layout onto the chopping board, if you it 's actually pressed to cut it if you cut against the grain again.
that will make it much more ten.
remember the brain small.
then slices, which along so i 've cut up all the beef were nearly get to go.
but i 'm just going to have lost taste of this marinade and see if it needs anything else.
and , yeah, it 's really nice.
so , but i think an easy touch more so you have n't had any copier.
so again if we just add about two teaspoons, maybe even try it out perfect.
so we 've got mix, it all around great distribution, and then best marinade it map stop it.
so we 're going to put the beef in this container marinade.
it for up to an hour in the fridge and actually, last time when it 's in room temperature, you only probably need about thirty minutes or so.
but obviously if you wanna, marinate it for longer one or two hours is absolutely fine, too.
so we 'll just put that in the fridge or an hour and then we 're going to come here.
so while waiting for beef to finish monitoring we 're going to cut up an onion so, we chocolate and half, then the schools.
so into a corner of main and then we slice it extremely thinly, and then we will fry it with the baby.
it just little bit.
now what we 're going to do is the beast finish marinating.
so we 're going to try it, and then we 're also going to fight the onions that we just dropped that actually go on top of the foreign service.
so we do come.
separately , i 'm just going to cut the onion first.
so if you just use a little grapeseed oil or vegetable oil i 'm going to fry the onions onto until they got turned transparent.
so just to add that little bit of sweetness and laura and here we go he was wound up those onions in there, low, medium round.
find the more time you take more say, turn our attention to the beach so little breast grow rapeseed oil in this case grapeseed.
oil also works very, well, unflavored oil.
so it does n't, oil is more any rich.
another william sphere, we 've got over their hours look it up now.
hey nursery marinated i guess the thing to do is not hurt.
this order, one though, get fit by beth.
oil is heated painted up, had an evening late how are onions mix, it around, have more faith?
i will see the final product.
yeah , it 's great.
so clear ice great servant, emma cheers.
any kind of korean officials to all heavily tribute and also, and also service will go with a prior chili paste, which can also be made the phone with some down.
but i was like to enjoy it as it is.
i feel favor search coming along nicely.
we do n't want to do this over cooked list.
'cause obviously, but noises tend to be that 's going been softened and mate and avoid a pair.
the problem, nine sixty caps.
they hang their scratch is ready to go, shut down on a plate here is faith or bill gates who just serve it on a plate.
put the fried onions on top.
and i may be a little bit of spring onion.
and if you 're really going out soon so delta sesame E seeds just for decoration, enjoy with rice kimchi, an, an eye screw glass of there thank you.
