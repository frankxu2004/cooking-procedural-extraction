which came first the chicken or the egg and the answer is.
of course, they bolted one inside the other.
the question i 'm often asked is how can you tell.
if an egg is really fresh.
without , of course, breaking it well, you can try the water test.
take a bowl of cold water and then put in some eggs and you 'll notice that the fresh one will sink to the bottom, while the one that 's not quite fresh will stand up on its pointy end.
and the one that 's quite stale will bounce around on the surface.
simple question, you cook some hard boiled eggs.
you put them in the refrigerator along with the fresh ones and then later.
you do n't know, which is which how can you tell again without breaking the eggs and simple just take them for a spin as you can see the harbour.
one likes to spin like bad, whereas the fresh one does n't at all now, one of my favorite recipes is bacon and eggs.
and i 'm not doing that on consuming passions today.
but instead a recipe that uses those elements it is spaghetti carbonara classic and this impressions version, first, i get my spaghetti going in a large pot of lightly salted boiling water.
i great a little nutmeg and then plunge in some of things.
spaghetti string around once and then leaving it well alone now while it 's cooking.
i prepare some good smoky bacon by slicing it up into strips, and then i crisp it in a large nonstick frying pan now.
i pour off the excess bacon fat, turn the heat down low and add a little butter and just a little extra virgin.
now the next phase is in a large bowl.
i whisk two whole eggs.
did you know, by the way that egg whites are among the only alkaline foods you can find along, with baking powder?
most of our foods are acidic, and i had two egg yolks.
now , although some recipes call for just egg yolks, i find this dish less rich using whole eggs as well as the two egg yolks, incidentally, where you aware that an egg yolk is half water.
yes , it is and thirty four percent lipids, fats, fats and so on and sixteen percent protein and minerals and now store in little cream tablespoon or two.
but this is starting to look quite rich, remember, it 's going in with quite a lot of spaghetti, and i 'm adding something else.
besides the grinding of black pepper, a pinch of white pepper.
because i like to have the two different flavors.
so valuable so it was used as currency.
not a cheese i like to great in my own parmesan cheese and a little certainly goes a long way.
and i had a cup of finely chopped parsley preferably italian parsley.
this mixture is now ready for the final stage of preparation.
just moments before serving the spaghetti is drained and it does n't matter if a little water is lifted the spaghetti.
the pan with the bacon is put on medium heat, and once sizzling 's here, i tossed through the spaghetti a large walk like this is great for this purpose.
amongst , the spaghetti have started the steam.
i stir through the big mixture and cook to a smooth consistency making sure not to overcook i 'll finish up with scrambled eggs.
now an optional extra little cooked asparagus or broccoli is here with color crunch.
an added freshness at impostor a little more parmesan cheese, a little more parsley.
and it 's time to serve on a large warmed bowl degree of difficulty very low preparation time, will?
the whole dish can be prepared in twenty five minutes capability.
it 's best eaten straight away, but may be reheated through a little extra cream or stock to re, moisten final flourish of a little more.
parsley little more parmesan and a little more black pepper and the dish is ready to eat the consuming passions.
version of spaghetti carbonara, a bacon and excellent dish, especially served with salad and some crusty bread and possibly for awhile accompagnement of barbera australian, of course from consuming passions to.
next time banana people.
