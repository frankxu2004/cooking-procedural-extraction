zoe , you can, of course, buy dumpling wrappers, which are easily get, but it 's also pretty easy to make your own.
it takes a bit longer to do, but i 'm going to show you how to make them great what i 'll start with.
is two and a half cups of plain flour, which i 'll put into the bowl here as long as it 's not self rising.
because you wanted to stay nice and flat to that?
i 'm going to add one cup of cold water straight in the middle.
here , like this choice upstairs, you can start mixing that nice and gently and some sesame E.
all i 've got a little bit of sesame E oil here, a better teaspoon is what you need in there and also to season it up grab about a teaspoon of salt, and you sort of makes it through with, with a wooden spoon to get a gun.
but for me i like to get my hands, and then also the wooden spoons good.
but i reckon you sort of get in there and just sort of made it up.
know that sesame E will and it 's great, is n't it beautiful?
so i 'll just move that around like that and all that just put this bola site, and i just give this a little bit of a need on the board here.
like this, so it just sort of comes together, and it looks a little bit dry, but as it sits there, it will actually soften up a little bit.
so all i do is pop the detail on top of it and let it sit down now.
we 've got to make the feeling.
what means there, which i 'll get you to put that straight into the bowl here.
and with my knife i 'm going to get some of these products.
and , one of the problems with their tails.
i just take a little tails off like that, and if you can get that gallic there, just about half a clove of garlic on the fine grader and the same with the ginger straight into that bowling you could use some mushrooms in there instead of building up with whatever you want, and these problems here where you know, just lying around the fridge shot him up.
and i chop them up like this.
they go all the way through it really, really, well, now.
what i 've got here is some chinese cabbage shredded at norton file and just.
so tight in a pan to become software that cabbage lot sweeter than normal cabbage as well to great cabbage, you can do anything with it, you know, and what i 've got here is some coriander you can put as much in it as you want also to.
just chop it up like this, enough, but kathy lime leaves, in this before afters kathy align layers, i think they 're just gorgeous, in their flavor.
now for some onion flavor of just got these spring onions might get really chunky, and course, you know, it does n't need to be really fun.
but i reckon this is sort of nice and rustic.
we had guard tries before really pungent and strong, but.
i reckon they go really well, in dumplings, and that 's why the mix it around like that, right.
so , some sort of we need some salt in there and if you put any soy sauce in there.
yet so if you grab the soy source, i 'll put a pinch of salt in it about, about a teaspoon oregon.
we do n't need a lot in there.
i 've got some pepper.
hirneisen , kozlov, the asian flavor with pepper.
i think it really sort of set things off.
so that 's the mixture there now while i 'm waiting for my daughter risk just to keep everything.
nice and safe.
we put this in the fridge, then will clear this up.
then will roll it out doubt and will be ready to make a pot sticking dumplings sounds like fun, have a look at this study of let it rest?
so , so, it 's nice and sort of soften much easy to work with.
and i roll it out into a nice little log and what i 'll do is.
and once you got into log like that what i do is cut these that all sort of round pieces along and from there recipe like this you 'll get between twenty and thirty dumplings, depending on how big you want them.
but i 'll just show you this.
so what i do is grab one of these things here with my thumb just sort of dust, with flour and just sort of push it out just gently.
so it goes into a nice sort of round again it is, and i 've also got this thing, which is a little piece of dowel, or, you know, piece of broom, handle which you can cut off just do n't get caught.
cutting it off around my house is actually see that being cash now.
i 'm going to sort of leave it a little bit sort of thick, because i want to fry them off.
and i want it to be nice instead of chunky and see how easy it is with that little piece of done.
that 's fun doing this as well, but i reckon once you 've made about ten, or twenty of these.
you sort of get the hang of it really well.
the trick is when you 're doing them is capability to flower on your fingers, stops it from sticking their.
you 've got the rapper there.
now the thing is when you 're using pork and prawn raw meat like that, instead of leaving it on the bench, so it 's a risk.
you must put in the fridge and keep it nice and cold now what we 've got here is their little doe.
and i 'm just going to grab a better tablespoon of this and that little jug over there.
but i like the little crescent shape.
because looking that, that 's a great one zoe.
so we need to do is make a few more of these, just spread them out, and the best way to do it, is sort of like a little production line?
sort of thing so that you do there.
we go just a little teaspoon, and you know, what pudding the garlic and ginger in there is nice and healthy.
no time at all.
with many should put together a few little wonky, dumplings there.
we go push it down, and then in my pan here.
this is the way we 're going to cook them, are going to great way is what we call the pot stickers with a nice?
instead of crisp on one side and the sort of crunchy and we 've got a little bit of water and then i 'll show you how to do it, and one of them is my pan on a medium heat.
and what i 'll do is i 'll put some olive oil if you can pass me that only one over there is a bit like the japanese gears.
the same this is how you do it.
i put a little bit of olive oil in there, but you could use vegetable oil, you know, i 've got some sesame E oil here.
so i 'll put a couple of drops of that in there they all sort of flavor.
good idea, yeah, the trick with these is not to overcrowd the pan.
if you put too many in and they stick together, there 's nothing worse you want to sort of spread them around you just sort of arranged them in the pan there on a medium is sort of hit 'cause you do n't want to get into hot.
what you want to do is actually fry them on the outside.
so they become nice and crisp on the bottom.
and then i 'm going to pour some water in there just about a quarter of a cup, which will help to steam it and cook the outside of the dumpling and then to finish it off.
there you go so heavily.
that , that looks like is cooked to perfection a little bit soft on one side and crunchy on the other, you know, give it a bit of a turn around.
and all you do is just put that straight on the plate.
like that, what i 'll do.
is i 'll get one of these, and i 'll just cut it in half, so, excuse my fingers, but i just want to show, show?
you exactly what i mean, the pokes cook the prawns cooked that lovely dumpling.
i want you to have a taste of that.
and i want you to tell me what it 's like, oh, it 's hot.
it 's very hot.
the patient is much thicker them, i 'm used to having but the flavors are really lovely.
that 's what it 's about just quick and easy dumplings fried nice and crispy.
i ca n't wait to try your stain one so it 's alright.
i 'm going to be a little lighter.
it 'll be delicious.
and we can compare the two.
