hi , welcome to show me the curry dot com.
i 'm in asia and today we 're going to show you how to make samosas.
i think it 's a very, very popular and very well known appetizer and very simple recipe.
but today we 're going to be making for two P, two of us.
so we 're going to be making four samosas.
but the recipe that you see on our website and on the screen is meant for four people, so approximately about.
so let 's get started right so to start off with.
we 're going to make the crust for this mosa and for that we 're going to use one and a half cups of all purpose flour or mega.
anta , that we 're going to add three quarters.
teaspoon salt in a quarter teaspoon of adjoin going to mix this up.
and we 're going to mix in two tablespoons of oil.
now this is a really important part.
when you 're making samosa crust is that you have to make sure that the oil is completely incorporated into the flower.
an basically, if you run it through your hands like this then you can feel the little lumps of oil, you know, make sure all the lumps are gone and then every bit of the flower has some portion of the oil in it, and that gives you a nice pastry type crest.
so while apple is doing that.
what we have done is just to give us a little head , start.
we have soaked in one teaspoon of each of solve, which is, which is fennel seeds and one teaspoon of whole coriander seeds and over here.
we have one and a half pounds potatoes.
we boil them, an feel them and we just kind of cube them.
so that 's all prepped up and ready to go and our flower is ready.
now it 's completely coated with the oil to do this.
we 're going to add in one tablespoon of lemon juice, and also a quarter cup plus two tablespoons of water and we 're going to need this into a nice soft dough.
once that 's needed, we 're going to just take a little bit of plastic crap and just rap it up in that.
so it does n't dry up.
we 're going to let her go rest for about twenty minutes.
so why do we have the door, dressing you got this little time we 're going to start on the mixture of the filling.
so here like we mentioned, we had already cut up the potatoes and cute them and what we 're going to do is, we 're going to pre mix all the spices and everything to it.
and then cook it, and over here.
we have a little pan and it 's got two tablespoons of oil already.
heating in it.
so here 's the we 've drained out the, the fennel seeds and the whole coriander seeds an added to this smells.
so good and salt to taste half teaspoon of dry mango powder or unsure half teaspoon of garam , masala.
half teaspoon of sugar cilantro, and it 's about ten springs one tablespoon of minced ginger and green chili to taste, and we 're going to drizzle some lime juice to taste anne will mix this up really, well, OK, take this is ready, and you can actually taste it and make sure everything is OK.
good KR, two tablespoons of oil are hot.
you 're going to add in half a teaspoon of khuman seeds allow them to visual looks good.
and one a teaspoon of classical aida.
so and half a cup of green peas and potatoes are already cooked.
so we 're going to let soapies cook for about two minutes, just to soften him up a little bit to be allowed them to cook for about ten minutes and look they look done.
you 're going to add in the data mixture.
now mix and now since everything is quickly just going to cook it on to keep it on the flame till everything is heated all the way through.
so it 's been about twenty minutes.
anna doe has been resting all this time.
ann are like we showed you the filling.
it 's already done.
and we made sure it cools down to room temperature before you actually start putting it in right.
and we 're going to need this still one more time just to even it out when you 're making small cells or anything that you 're going to fill.
it 's always a good idea to divide out your filling to how many over you 're making.
so one does n't get more filling the next, and people are n't jealous.
all kinds of things like that, so divide your dough out into how many small, says you want to make portion of course will make too so.
most US so divide that out.
divide you 're filling out and then you can proceed.
we also have already started heating up the oil and it 's in a medium heat, and it 's going to be.
needs to be.
very , well, he did all the way through before we add the symbol cells into this oil.
so i put a little bit of oil on my rolling pin and just smooth it on there.
so it does n't stick to our samosa dough, and we 're going to roll this out pretty thin.
because this is all purpose flour, and it tends to be a little more elastic than your normal wheat flour.
so the more you stretch it out.
it kind of goes back into the shape so to make it very thin.
so , once you have your dell rolled out into like an oval shaped.
we 're going to cut it down the center.
and we 're going to take the side.
i 'm going to take just a little bit of plain water and lightly brush the edge with this.
we 're going to overlap the other edge on top and give it a good pinch seedless shut.
and once you do that you have a little cone that we can stuff in now and here, we have divided the mixture as well the filling.
and we 're going to put it in here.
like so and try not to overstuff.
because you want this part to actually seal, we 're going to take a water again a little bit of water and put it around the edges and then we 're going to stretch this part and seal.
it shut and bend it here on the sides.
then you have your samosa ready to fry and while you 're rolling the second one, sometimes like i said, the meta or all purpose flour is very elastic.
and the shape, they rolled out, it reduces by quite a bit.
so you may have to roll it out again just a little bit, so it 's not so thick.
the oil looks hot in my little is carrying on.
i 'm going to go ahead and try with careful written very gently do not splash it they look, done.
we 're going to pull them out to the side.
they got all the excess oil.
i 'm going to put it on a paper towel.
find the samosas are done.
they look fantastic.
and of course the best way to have some authors is with japanese do you have your time.
and chutney and your men techni.
actually , it, with ketchup so good by themselves absolutely, i 'm going to try this number two.
but i 'm ready for my small so alright, nice excellent delicious, OK, try it.
i gotta get better tribe.
i can have mine which company so enjoy a samosa los angeles again, and that sort of showing the carry dot com.
