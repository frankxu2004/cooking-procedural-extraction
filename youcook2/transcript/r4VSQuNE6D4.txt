today , i 'm going to be showing you how to make christmas pancakes.
the first thing is to make the batter.
i 'm going to use just add water mix for this.
i do n't usually measure the water.
i just keep adding until it somewhere between.
next , i 'm going to prepare these for my batter dispensers.
i 'm going to cut the cap off and then cut this at an angle, so that more batter can come out.
use a bowl that has a spout so that you can easily fill the containers.
now you want to prepare the stove by preheating it to a low to medium setting for santa.
you are going to start with the nose, then the mustache, the face and the hat and then the beard and the eyes after letting it cook for a little while you 're going to fill in the rest of the space, check that it 's cook loosen.
it , and now it 's ready to serve, and the last thing to do at the syrup every droid.
