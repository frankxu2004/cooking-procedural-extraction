hi guys welcome back.
i 've been away for awhile, but now i 'm back.
and i will be making a Q optimally today.
it 's actually been requested by one of us is farmers who is a vegan, and i actually make this dish all the time.
it 's one of my favorites and then i thought i should share it with you guys.
so i hope you enjoy it.
OK , let 's get started.
the first thing we should do is cook the quinoa and.
let 's come over here and do it.
so we have a about a cup of water, boiling here.
we could add about a couple pinches of salt, and this is half a cup of quinoa to just dump that in just come to a boil, which is like about thirty seconds, and then cover the pot.
an lower it, and let it cook for about fifteen minutes.
here , the keen wah should already be ready.
let 's check up on it.
yeah , looks like it 's ready at this point.
we shared pull off edwards before and put some olive oil on it, so they do n't stick OK looks good.
the keno right.
it has no flavor at all.
so what i 'd like to do is flavor it with some dried mint.
this is a little bit of dry, meant it as a really big flavor to this smaller already put some more?
this , is definitely optional.
if you like men who do n't have to add this hey looks good.
i 'm going to put it in the shallow dish so that it 'll cool down.
and in the mean time we could chop up some greens while this cools down.
so we 're going to put some parsley A little bit of cilantro some green onions.
a half of a cucumber tomatoes of course.
hey , you want to finally chop all these greens, chance of everything in this nursing bowl.
this is a little bit of cilantro now going to drop the green onions and the tomato.
how was my first so sharp?
i would need to have to this component not to season the salad.
we 're going to put olive oil song and a half of a lemon and the other half of the lemon is going to go on top of this, shut up.
now we can pour this over the quinoa and look all the juices absorb into the quinoa, and i like to put a avocado on top just looks really good.
and it tastes good too there.
you have it guys.
this was my version of achimota bully the best way to eat.
this is refrigerate.
this , for about an hour and let all the juices.
soak into the QR or you could just eat it right away if you ca n't wait i hope you enjoy this video.
i will be posting a lot more videos.
so stay tuned.
