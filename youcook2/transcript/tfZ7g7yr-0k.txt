we have a lot of them here.
we 've got three teaspoons of ground coriander, one teaspoon of paprika, one teaspoon of yellow curry when teaspoon of turmeric one teaspoon of garma sala that 's an indian spice blend, we 've got one half teaspoon of garlic powder and one half teaspoon of cayenne pepper will add all these into our onion garlic, and ginger mix, and we also add in one half of a teaspoon of coarsely ground sea salt in store all of your dry spices in with the onions.
this will give these just a moment to heat up and cook and left the oils release from them, and next, will add the rest of our ingredients?

we need to do.
now is to take our potato masher and go in and mash, some of the chick peas, and you can make this as, you know, chunky or mash as much as you want to just really depends on your taste what this does , is.
it thickens the dish up and gives it just a little bit, more smooth texture so that looks about right.
i like to mash about half of the chick peas from myself, and after you get this to your liking it 's time to stir in our last ingredient, which is about one half of a cup chopped cilantro.
