hi , everybody, this is diana from sweetie, salado and today.
we 're going to make colombian hotdogs now.
this is a very basic recipe on how to make them, and the reason.
i say basic is.
because if you go to colombia, you 'll see that they put a ton of different crazy toppings on their hot dogs in their burgers like potato chips, bacon in even quail eggs.
so if you use this recipe as a base, you can add whatever toppings you want, as always, the link for this recipe is going to be available in the info box below, and at the end of the video.
some of the sauces that you can add to your hot dogs are your basic mayo basic ketchup and mustard, but if you want you can add some garlic.
mayo pink sauce, and even pineapple sauce.
an i 'm using pineapple preserves.
but you can also make the sauce.
now on the channel, i have video on how to make all these three sauces, and i 'm going to leave you the link for that in the info box below another, topping you can use it some coleslaw.
this is your basic coleslaw, and i have the recipe for this on the channel, as well, we 're also going to add some shredded mozzarella cheese in the last, topping we 're going to use is some crushed potato chips and what i do is, i grab regular potato chips, put him in a resealable bag and then i just smash them with my hands.
you can also use a rolling pin until they 're completely crushed.
so now that we have all of our toppings ready, we are going to boil our hot dogs.
and i 'm going to boiling for about five minutes, which is what the directions on the package say, and then during the last minute of boiling i 'm going to put a steaming basket on top and then i 'm going to add my hot dog buns, and as you can see i 'm using hoagie rolls.
because i need a bigger piece of bread to hold all the toppings that we 're going to put in the hot dogs in to assemble the hot dogs which is going to put a hot dog in the hoagie roll, and they 're going to start adding our toppings, we 're going to start with some coleslaw.
but also add some mozzarella cheese are crushed potato chips, and then we 're going to put some of that pink sauce are garlic mail.
some ketchup and pineapple sauce, and if you want you can add some quail eggs to this in those tastes.
