hi guys, and welcome to cooking with karma now on monday.
i showed you how to make those absolutely scrumptious onion rings and today.
we 're going to make some equally scrumptious, hash browns.
now we 're not going to deep fry, then we 're going to pan fry them going to throw in some sweet potatoes and onions in a bit of spice.
i really hope you enjoy this one.
let 's get started.
and i 'll show you just how to make them so the first thing we 're going to do is partially.
boil al potatoes.
now about five to seven minutes should do it while they 're doing their thing into a pan with a little bit of oil were going to cook up some onions.
now we 're going to cook the onions for about the same time as the potatoes until they nice and soft, and they developed just A touch of color, then we 're going to give them another quick chop until they 're nice and fine.
one cell potatoes have been drained and cooled.
it 's time to great them up.
once the role grated, we 're going to add a potato and the onion into a bowl.
we 're going to season it with some pepper.
a little touch of chili powder and some garlic salt.
then we 're just going to give everything a good mix until it 's well combined.
then we 're going to play some mixture into the bridge for about twenty minutes, till it firms up, then it simply putting them together into the shape of the hash brown and popping them into a pan with some oil.
now depending on how you like EEG respect, it you can either do like a shallow fries, or you do n't need to use much oil at all, they turn out great either way.
so on a medium to high heat what is going to cook these on ironside until they 're golden brown crispy on the outside and nice and tender on the inside that nice little hint of spice these are a great addition to any breakfast, yum, really simple an really tasty of course, if you 're not a fan of sweet potato, you can leave that at all together and feel free to use whichever herbs and spices that you like.
but i really hope you give that recipe ago thanks again for joining me have a wonderful weekend and i 'll see you all on monday.
