i 'm reaching out to hey.
what 's up everybody today.
i 'm going to kick off a series of basically in olympics, series youtube has brought a hundred youtubers together and broken him down into a few different groups, youtubes rallying around the olympics just.
so exciting, i mean, i am.
so excited about the olympics, and i 'm going to kick it off with a bangers and mash just.
because tribute to where the olympics are being held, this year, and obviously, that 's london, please join me in recreating this classic english pub dish bangers and mash which is basically just sausage and potatoes.
so these small yukon gold potatoes would take about a half an hour to boil.
but as that 's boiling, get a hot saute pan and add both of your season sausages to them until they get nice and golden brown we say hello, if you 're being health conscious, you can avoid this.
next step by just adding the herbs dried to the pan no matter where you trust me i 'll guarantee, i 'll never be to fire you 'll feel my red heart beat.
so after a half an hour, these baby yukon gold potatoes are absolutely perfect and i like to let him cool for about five minutes before i play tribes were great, as a last minute garnished especially for this dish is going to add color and a bit of spice.
so once you 're done cooking get all your ingredients in front of you and start playing a traditional bangers and mash usually has whipped potatoes.
but since i saw, these small uconn gold potatoes at the store, i just could n't help resist using them.
so here it is bangers and mash my salute to the olympics, london style do you, you reaching out to me a million miles between us.
and we still can speak we say, hello, i wanna hear your voice says if you 're next.
