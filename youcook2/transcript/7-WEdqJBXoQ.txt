hi , everyone, i 'm rockin robin from cooking mexican, recipes dot com.
now today i 'm going to show you how to make some oven fried chicken.
we 're going to season this with some bread crumbs with some italian seasonings in that, and i 'll tell you.
it 's just a little bit healthier than your typical up and fried chicken so in the cleanup is so much easier.
you do n't have all that grease splatter all over your stove.
and you do n't have to worry about getting rid of all that extra oil that you 've used to cook the chicken in so do n't go away.
i 'll be right back to tell you all about it.
so let me go over the ingredients with you so we can get started with our oven, fried chicken.
so for our chicken, i 'm going to be using chicken thighs now.
i have four of am here.
an obviously the bone is in an.
i had the skin on and i left the skin on this one piece here.
so that i could show you my little tip for easily removing the skin off the chicken.
so basically what you want to do is, i just grab a paper towel and i loose in this skin up, and then i use the paper towel to pull back on the skin.
an , i tell you, it 's a vice grip that just really just pulls it right off you have a nice grip on it.
so that works beautifully to do it that way OK.
so are other ingredients.
are our coding here?
i 've got an egg, which i 'm going to beat up in a minute, and my seasoned breadcrumbs now, these are italian, seasoned bread crumbs which means they have some spices in him already, and i really like this.
i bought this at whole foods.
it 's the three hundred sixty five brand.
so if you want to try that you can if you do n't have season breadcrumbs you have a hard time finding it.
i 'm going to leave a little recipe for you in the description below this video.
so you can do your own if you like, and will also need a little bit of flowers about a quarter of a cup and the ratio to the bread crumbs.
that 's about a cup and then the other item that you 'll need is some real butter.
this is organic butter.
i had one of my fans or my viewers to my channel, asked me to state when i use organic ingredients.
so there you go i 'll probably add just a little more salt in a little bit of pepper, and that 's all we 'll need.
i want to mention that you want to be preheating your oven right now to four hundred and twenty, five degrees.
all right, so what i 'm going to do on this plate here is i 'm just going to combine my season breadcrumbs with the flower.
so sprinkle that on top and then blended up really well.
now you 'll take your egg and just beat that before so now all we do is.
you take a thigh.
i 'm going to dip it right into the egg mixture just to give it a little coding.
so that the bread mixture will stick to it really well, late in your crumbs, and i like take a spoon and just sort of sprinkle.
the crumbs over the chicken.
it just makes a little bit easier and just toss it around until it 's all covered shake off any access and then just lay it on your baking sheet.
now i 'm using a pampered chef.
it 's like a clay baking sheet, and i like to use that it 's not teflon and it works beautifully.
so i 'm going to go ahead and continue coding the rest of my chick in.
and we 'll go from there.
so with the amount of bread crumbs and even the egg that i had leftover you can easily make six even eight pieces of chicken to show you that all i wanted for today for myself is four.
so that 's why i have some leftover bread crumbs.
so , yeah, and you could you certainly chicken breasts legs thighs.
whatever you want to do as well.
so now all we have left to do is if you want to add just a little bit more salt just give a little sprinkle on top of each piece, just a little bit and maybe a little pepper is that in our last thing is butter.
so i had my butter in the refrigerator.
so it 's nice and cold.
i 'm peeling off a nice thin piece of butter can you see that.
can you see how thin that is going to show you that in just a second here.
but you have to have your butter nice and cold in order to be able to do that.
so what i do is?
i take my knife and i go across the top and i make a very thin sliver of butter and hopefully you can see that it 's just like paper, paper thin and then i place that on top of the chicken, adding too much butter.
but just a nice thin, very thin paper layer i 'm kind of good at this, and everybody makes fun of me.
i 've got this big valley in the butter in there like what you do to the butter it 's just me, shaving off in pieces when i want it really nice and thin.
but like i said it 's gotta.
be cold to do that, so.
i just put a few pieces on top and show you that here in just a second just.
so you 've got to put a little bit of fat to get those bread.
crumbs moistened an this butter will drip down and get on the bottom as well, and then the bottom will also get nice and brown.
so here is the chick in here, you can see where i placed the very thin slices of butter and that 's pretty much it.
so we 're going to place this in the oven, and remember i told you at set at four twenty five.
so will go do that now, and we 're going to check it in about fifteen minutes.
it will probably take half an hour.
total will put in for fifteen will turn it over and then we 'll do it another fifteen so you can see here.
i 'm going to place this in the oven, and i have it on the lower third of the rack.
not the very bottom rack.
but just one up above that.
so like i said, we 'll check that in fifteen minutes alright here, we go we 're going to check the chicken time to turn it over starting to turn a nice golden brown.
OK , then we going to let that go for another probably eighteen minutes.
i 'm going to go alright, so here 's our chick in after about thirty five minutes.
it 's a beautiful golden brown.
and i 'm just going to go ahead and cut into it you can use an instant read thermometer.
now it 's got a little pink in it still going to let it go probably one more minute or so.
that one looks done not that go one minute and then we 're going to pull it out OK.
so here 's our chick in just out of the oven, does n't that look fantastic, nice and golden brown.
it 's delicious, cooks up within about a half an hour, depending on how big your pieces are.
and you can serve this up with any kind of side dish, salad vegetables.
and you 've got a delicious meal that is healthier than regular fried chick.
in so you gotta give this a try so do try my oven fried.
chicken , i know you 're going to really enjoy it, it 's cook.
