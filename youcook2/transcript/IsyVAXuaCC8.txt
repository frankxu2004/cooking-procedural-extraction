hello , and welcome to another episode of and there you have it, spring is upon us and we want to be outside and we want to be skewering up a couple of shish , kabobs.
so i 'm armenian.
and we 're going to be making some great armenian shish, kabob along with that.
my dad simple and easy rice pilaf.
so , let 's go and there, you have it now.
the first thing we want to do is we want to make the marinade for the meat and this is going to have to sit in the fridge for i 'd like to do it, twenty four hours.
so what you want to do is prepare this around the time you plan on eating dinner, the.
next day so the person for most we 're going to make the liquid portion and that 's going to consist of a half a cup of red wine any dry.
red wine does n't matter.
and then we have a one fourth cup of tomato paste just top satin will have a white shirt, we 're going to have some great times with that be careful on that, and then we have one fourth cup of extra virgin olive oil.
and we also have two tablespoons of red wine vinegar there, going to be a little more careful this time.
put it that way.
then we take our wisc right here, and you just want to whisk that up.
nice and easy just like so.
so that the tomato paste sort of dissolves a little bit in the rest of the liquid, then we are going to add two cloves of finely chopped garlic, just like this.
and one softball sized onion finely chopped just toss all those onions right in there.
and then you want to go ahead and give that a quick mix again.
it 's going to be really oniony.
i 'm really garlicky almost like a bit of a paste and the last thing we want to do is you want to toss in your spices.
i just make some all under one bowl just toss that in and try to mix that up as even as you possibly can, and then we are going to have one and a half pounds of either lamb, which is the shish of the shish , kabob.
so if you do n't use lamb it 's no longer a shish, kabob is actually a beef kabob chicken kabob.
you can use whatever you want, and chop it up into little squares.
or you can ask your butcher.
and they can do it for you.
they 'll chop it up into squares, but it 's pretty simple.
you can get yourself a roast of some sort and just chop it up into little skewer size squares.
but anyway, so you 're going to toss that right in just like that.
toss , it all away.
it 's worth it.
so what you want to do is you really want to mix this up as much as you can.
so that every piece of meat is completely covered and once you 've done that just kind of settle it down in the bottom give your hands.
a quick, quick rinse, and we 're going to cover this.
and we 're going to toss it right into the fridge for a good twenty, four hours OK now that are marinade has been marinating for twenty, four hours.
we 're going to actually start the cooking process for dinner so the first thing you want to do is get your rice.
started , we 're going to make a rice pilaf.
it 's a very simple rice pilaf, but very tasty.
so grab yourself about three tablespoons of butter.
you 're going to toss out in the pan and get it started.
you just want to bring that to a medium heat, and we 're going to melt it.
but while we 're doing that, we also want a little bit of spaghetti just get.
like , you know, i 'm good.
i do n't know quarter size.
the way i judge it is looking at this angle here.
and , that 's about the size of a quarter right there, and that 's probably too much, so i 'll take just a tiny bit away from that.
but that 's about right what you want.
and what you 're going to do is you 're actually going to crack this into tiny little pieces.
so what i 'd like to do is just snap off the bottom so that the length of them are about that long about that long.
take a fork or whatever you want to do, and your, your butter is melting like that.
what you 're going to do is you 're going to mix it in just like this, and essentially.
what you 're trying to do is brown these OK now.
these are about brown there about where i like him.
nice golden brown, as you can see not burnt, but golden brown, so once there at that color, then you 're going to add the rice.
i 've got one cup of rice here and always, with rice as i always say, double the water, so again use cold water.
if you want it to sit in the rice, so we got two cups of rice are one cup of rice.
i 'm going to go with two cups of water since i have the noodles in there.
i 'm going to add another cup of water or the noodles.
how do you want to do?
is bring that up to a boil.
so you want to turn that on high, bring it to a boil as soon as it boils bring it down to a simmer cover.
it and leave it for about a half hour.
so i like to go here.
just all, you gotta do.
is grab a piece of meat stab it right through the.
center , get all the way.
you want to leave a little space there so that you have a place to flip these when you 're ready to flip him on the, on the growth.
and then it 's up to you, however, you want.
i like to do an onion right up near there, then let 's go with a tomato, right down the center.
how about another piece of meat.
that , yeah, i get in there perfect.
then right down the center i 'm not a huge fan of green peppers.
but they do add a nice color.
so i 'm going to put one there, just for color.
and then what will do is will do the same combination again onion tomato and one more piece of meat right on the skewer that seems to be just about right enough space for you can spin.
it , like that, we 're going to do the whole set pretty simple.
i 'll see you back.
here when we 're done with that OK.
i 'll rice is looking good starting to look really nice.
i gave it a little stir as soon as it came to a boil, an i brought it down to a simmer and cover it.
i 'm just going to leave that and the next thing.
now that this is hot and buttered you just grab these and i 'm just going to put all eight of these, it, down right here, so, as soon, as this one side for about sixty seven minutes, after about six minutes, or so, i 'm going to flip it over to the other side, do about six minutes, and then i 'll just kind of rotate them to my taste.
i like a medium, but some people like him, well, done some people.
but for me, it 's a good medium, i do about six minutes on each side pretty much ready to go enjoy alright.
it 's time for planning.
let 's go grab the rice just like that.
it is done.
we 're going to do is we 're going to scoop right down the center of the plate couple of nice big scoops kind, even it out over the plate just like.
so now some people like to pull these off the skewer for the people.
i personally let them do that, so i just problem right off like that.
and like i said, i 'm doing for, for plate.
and grab two at a.
time , do n't burn yourself smell.
so good turn, those off armenian shish, kabob and my dad 's rice pilaf and there you have it.
