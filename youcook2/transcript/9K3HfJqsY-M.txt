allrecipes member nancy says honest, this meso soup is the real thing, the secret is the dashi, granules.
i had to go to a japanese market to get it, but it was worth it.
let 's start by slicing two green onions on the diagonal into half inch pieces.
next dyson eight ounce package of silken tofu into half inch cubes now, in a medium saucepan over medium heat add four cups of water.
two teaspoons of dashi, granules bring the dashi, granules and water to a boil.
reduce the heat to medium before adding the meso, meso is full of rich enzymes, and boiling will kill them stir in three tablespoons of miso paste.
add the diced tofu into the soup and stir it.
you just need to heat the tofu through not cook, it then separate the layers of the green onions, taking care to keep the rings hole and adding the green onion.
serve it well hot.
all recipes member, diane asked, commented that we recently enjoyed a delicious meso soup at a sushi restaurant, and i was trying to come close to that we actually thought this one was better, will be making this often?
