you got up a great bun and a great dog.
and we 've got a killer frankfurter down there.
but really, for hot dogs are all about is there toppins and the first thing.
i 've got here.
is a killer, killer mustard with chili 's?
and smoked pepper rica to start with.
i 'm going to do a really beautiful caramelized, shallot with bacon to go on the top, let 's get it on right the pans getting up.
let 's get the oil in the pan.
OK , so you want about two tablespoons of oil, and, you know, the pans ready.
because the oil goes in it starts dancing so then shallots in there.
go get those bad boys.
all in so this season, let 's just give them a toss and what you want to do you want to put them on a medium to high heat.
the natural sugars in there.
we 're going to get that beautiful brand camera lies vibe, going on.
OK , so when you gonna make that sort of stage, turn the heat down to low, grab some dark brown sugar and just a little bit not much on the top.
so we 're going to do is not just cook that nice and stuff, which is really allow it to caramelize, clipping , delish.
we 've been cooking there for about five to six minutes on a low heat.
we 're going to take him off and dry them on some kitchen roll.
so you want to get all the excess oil out to spread them out and drain them properly.
set those aside to dry out and get nice and crispy right griddle pan on get it up to a medium heat, and then we 'll get the dogs in going to grab some oil just lightly drizzle this bowl, and then i 'm going to get my dogs and just work them a little bit around you just coating them ever.
so slightly so they do n't stick OK and then.
let 's get these guys into the griddle pan.
OK , now you can use whatever sausages you want.
i 'm using the classic frankfurters and these are smoked sausages.
so i just want to put them in a low PE pan to bring him back to life.
you can use whatever you want to make sure you cook him all the way through delish.
now , the fiery mustard you want two hundred grams of french is mustard, then we want one teaspoon of smoked pepper rica.
one teaspoon of chili flakes and then one teaspoon of olive oil and what i would say is make a big batch, all these products will stay for months.
so just put it in your fridge, and bosh fiery must have done, yeah, OK hotdogs halfway done, which is going to get him and flip him over.
yeah , yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they 're ready to rock.
so i 'm going to set those aside, and will start building the dog.
if you burn down the middle, so let 's grab a dog and put him in there raw.
remember those shallots they 've dried up beautifully.
i 'm going to grab the bacon i cooked earlier, and i 'm just going to break in to the shallots and then.
let 's dress it.
so you 've got to get your wiggle.
