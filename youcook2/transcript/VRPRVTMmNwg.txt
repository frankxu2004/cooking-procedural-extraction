well , howdy, today we want to do some beef.
shish , kabobs got pretty good recipe.
here we 're going to make a marinade to let him let the armitt soaking for.
we need you wanted to marinate for at least two hours in our case.
we 're going to let it set overnight the first thing we want to do is make our marinade.
and we start with one tablespoon of salt.
one teaspoon sugar eighth of a teaspoon of paprika, a eighth of a teaspoon of black pepper eighth of a teaspoon of garlic powder, an eighth of a teaspoon of onion powder.
then , we mix in two thirds, cup of red wine, burgundy or you want to some kind of dry right wine burgundy is a good one.
that 's what this is.
sterf , make sure all the stuff gets dissolved in there.
it 's a pretty simple marinade that 's basically all there is to it right there and then that we, we bought a chuck roast.
you can also use the sirloin steak, you want something that 's all i 'd say at least an inch thick, just cause we 're going to be cutting this and cubes, and you do n't want little bitty slivers of maine you want a good chunk there.
but you can use sirloin or basically any, any cut of meat.
and we 're just going to cut this and the cubes, how tall are meat cubed up bout inch cubes.
that 's kind of the way i like comes like this going to put them all in a zip lock, baggie.
and put a marinade on top of it, put all work in there, well, i like to do is let all that get all the air out of it and just let it that it set like that overnight and a whore at least two hours, we 're going to set it overnight and then we 'll come back in the morning and put him in RPG, five hundred and i had some vegetables to him and grill 'em.
for any we 've had our stuff.
marinate , we let this marinade overnight, you do n't have to let it marinate overnight, but, at least two hours and azure letting it marinate you need if you 're using the bamboo skewers like were use.
and you need to make sure that they get soaked in water for at least two hours and the easiest way to do it as i just put these in a pan filled by the third of the way full of water and put a paper towel over all the skewers to make sure that they stayed underwater.
so there are good and wet now or marinades, been.
we 've let this soap for overnight, and we 're ready to make some shish, kabobs now.
i 'm a two secure man and the reason why i like to use two skewers is when you put the meat on and all the vegetables you can turn it really easy.
and the meat just do n't spend on the, on the stick.
so used to, and start off with peace, a piece of our meet there leaving about leave enough to hang onto and then just add some bastables.
i 've already dropped this.
i 've got a red onion.
some button mushrooms, some zucchini and some bell peppers not like the yellow and red and green bell peppers just cause i think they taste good in their party and it do n't hurt when your dish looks party and just make it, it do n't matter or what order you put this stuff in just, just put it in there, well, we got all our a shish, kabobs assembled or shish, kabobs, is mine?
we bought we made both chicken, and before we 've used the same marinade on both of 'em.
so to make it easy and when we get when we got him all done you might solve it up, put a real light coat of olive oil on brush them, with all around.
that 's just to help them.
not stick when we put him on the grill and one of the neat things about the PG five hundred, which is what we 're going to be using today.
there 's, uh, direct siding and indirect side.
we 're going to smoke him on the indirect side for about two hours at two twenty five and then after the two hours, we 're going to go back out there, and i 'm going to put a nice little char on him on the direct side and then put him in the warming drawer.
we 've got a warming drawer on that PG, five hundred that 'll keep everything.
nice and hot until all of its done, so let 's go out there and cook him on the PG five hundred.
well , we got him done it took about an hour and a half.
we cook them at, at two twenty five and what you want to do is bring the meat temperature up to about all.
about a hundred and twenty hundred and thirty and then finish him off on the high side.
that way you get some nice grill marks on him, you can use your warming tray to keep the ones that you get done, keep them hot while you finish off the rest of AM pasta.
neat thing about the PG five hundred.
but a little note just make sure if you use like we used pot roast, you 'll need to do some trimming on that, to trim out the gristle and stuff.
so you 're not beat bubble gum.
but they turned out really good.
there 's nothing to do, but, uh, enjoy them if you have any questions or would like to discuss this recipe or anything else.
just feel free to give me a call at eight hundred four two three zero six, nine eight.
