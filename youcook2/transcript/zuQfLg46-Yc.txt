hi , my name is manny martini and i 'm from eastern illinois university 's graduate dietetics program.
i 'm working in conjunction with the eastern illinois food bank to talk to you about using pantry staples.
so what are pantry staples.
these are foods that you can keep right on hand right there in your kitchen.
just in case you find yourself needing to make something for dinner and you do n't have time to go grocery shopping.
good pantry staples to have on hand include pasta rice canned tomatoes, canned beans, canned tuna chicken or vegetable broth, canola or olive oil onions.
garlic salt, and pepper and your favorite dried spices.
so we figured the best way to show you how to useful pantry staples can be is to make something with them.
and they were making one of my favourites pasta.
fragile , pasta, fragile or pasta fazul, depending on who you are talking too literally translates to pasta and beans is a tomato based soup using great flavors like onion.
garlic and basil and pasta visual is n't your typical chili mac is a hearty stick to your ribs.
naturally , vegetarian meal that you can customize.
anyway , you want, so, let 's get started.
the centers for disease control and prevention keeping your hands clean is one of the most important things you can do to avoid getting sick and prevents spreading illness to others, you 're going to add one to two tablespoons of cold or room temperature canola oil to a cold pot.
but we 're going to turn on the stove to a just a little over medium heat.
just so you can get things heating up.
so i 'm going to take a spoon here, and i 'm going to take out about, about a teaspoon 's worth of garlic.
and i 'm going to add it to the oil.
you hear that sizzle down love it.
alright so now we 're going to add the onion.
everything is just about turning.
then we 're going to give everything a stir.
so you 're going to saute the onion for a few minutes until it starts to turn translucent when we add our tomatoes add both of them and making sure you get every last drop from those cans 'cause it just pure goodness.
so the tomato, the tomatoes are bubbling at a pretty good clip here they 've been cooking for about ten minutes, and now it is time to add.
i 'm just going to give us stir first, yeah, already, all right.
so we 're going to take our beans and what i have here.
i have one can of pinto beans and one can of great northern beans, you can use which means you like great northern beans are the traditional ones that you 'd use.
but if you like pinto beans better, feel free to use as long as beans are tender and to use two cans of 'em, and.
now we 're going to add four cups of warm water.
because it will track the heating air and bring things to a boil.
all right, so now we 're going to add the pasta, the pasta fazool.
there 's one already and there 's and now you 're going to reduce the heat to a simmer.
and that means once something is come to a boil.
you bring things down to a low heat, let it simmer uncovered for about ten to twelve minutes or until the macaroni is cooked.
are pasta has been cooking in our soup for about, about ten minutes or so, and as you can see here it 's absorbed a lot of the lot of liquid, and it 's become nice and plump?
but you have is a big hearty bowl of pasta visual it 's going to have a nice mix of beans and pasta and tomatoes in it and it 's going to be really thick and new family is going to love it.
and you can have that on your own anytime.
you want to use a pantry staples again.
