and this is my north beach.
making pasta fagioli, AKA pasta fazul.
this is a favorite of mine, and it 's also a favorite of lovely armor thirteen, who suggested that i make this on youtube.
so that 's what i 'm cooking today.
so let me show you the ingredients for pasta.
fazul here 's cannellini beans that i soaked overnight we need the little shortcut pasta extra virgin.
olive oil celery onion, garlic, fresh italian parsley bay, leaf tried oregano sea salt black pepper.
tomato puree and some pecorino so let me get the hodori going first.
i 'm going to use celery and onion, so there 's one.
the second one cities leaves over here.
disconnect flavor to it if i got celery leaves, we 're going to use them.
OK , there 's my salary and we gotta, take a half moon on you.
then we got a little bit of garlic.
here , problem and bar boom of this a rough chop also let me get my pen going, i 'm using this enamel pot going to give it some olive oil.
maybe about two tablespoons.
i 'd say get these in, does the salary.
the onions, garlic bailey elect goodness is going right in there.
i do n't want to get any color on this, so i 'm going to keep a good eye on it.
we just want them to soften a little bit, they 'll finish cooking in the soup, of course.
but i just want to cook him a little bit to bring out their flavor anytime.
i 'm making a soup or stew all those start right by cooking your herbs or garlic onions will just let those go for a minute or two.
now that the onions in the celery of sweat, it down a little bit, this my sicilian oregano, and we had that.
now just let that toast up i 've got the cannellini beans that i soaked overnight, and i 'm going to put a cover to it easy you do n't want to soak beans overnight you can use canned cannellini beans, just make sure that you drain them well.
because you know, there 's going to be a lot of that starts down at the bottom of the can, and you do n't want that in here we 're going to add some water to this, you could use chicken stock you could use vegetable stock.
but this is going to be such a flavor of bull dish i do n't think, you need it i do n't want the salt i do n't want the other flavor.
so i 'm just using some good old hetch, hetchy water here in san francisco and you want to make sure that you 're more than fully covering beans.
so we 're going to bring the heat up to high lid on the jar and will just test these in about fifteen minutes and see if the beans are tender.
so the beans have been cooking for about ten minutes in the boiling water.
so i just want to add the final ingredients here before the pasta goes in.
so i 'm just going to add some parsley here to help flavor that brought right cause it 's just water, a little bit of salt and pepper and then we could always adjust this is a tomato puree from italy.
so i 'm going to add some of this for color take a look here see how we 're doing i take my beans are going to be let me taste one for you give, birth to binger are just about to the creamy stage time.
do i add my d'italie, ni, you know, usually my mother used to make this with death alley?
right there would it ended over here no way and i was there are bigger cut.
then this hard to find italy, discut sometime.
so detelina, you see more often.
so i 'm using that it 's going to be just as good some people like to cook their pasta separate, and then add it.
so there 's one downside to doing it this way the pasta is going to swell up.
so you better eat this soon the good thing is that some of that starch from the ditalini are going to help thicken the soup.
so will let it go probably about another five, six minutes.
and we 're going to, we 're going to be eating some pasta vazul.
let me taste it being and i got someone.
i think it 's going to be done now perfect.
these are little salt right always adjust salt and pepper.
i 'll give it a little bit of fresh pepper to hear.
so this is n't a real watery soup.
see you can see here.
see how it thickened, becaus it had the starts coming off the pasta.
so what you want OK, so here 's our pasta.
vazul , just going to brighten it up a little bit with some parsley, isala boiled little drizzle a little pecorino look at the mess.
I made over get that all in there.
not cheese is expensive.
i do n't want to lose any.
OK , let me take a little bit here see.
how nice and thick, it is, though you do n't want this to be like a brought look at that some other beans.
