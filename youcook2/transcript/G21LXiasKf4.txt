today , we 're making a favorite of everybody.
and it 's long overdue that i make some till i were making my homemade cheeseburgers.
so the first thing that we 're going to do is get started on our beef patties.
now into a bowl.
here i 'm going to add in some ground, beef or some minced beef.
i 'm going to season with some salt and pepper.
i 'm going to add in one egg.
i 'm also going to add in some dijon mustard, and it just gives the burger and nice kick.
and i 'm also going to add in some bread crumbs, and it just helps bind the burger together.
there goes using hands, make sure than awesome claimed just mix it through.
but i wanted to be careful.
because i do n't want to really squeeze the meat.
because if we do that we 're going to make out burger, too dense.
so i just want to gently just gently moved about.
get everything combined until it all comes together because that 's all you have to do an.
i tell you, that is the best cheeseburger you 'll ever have.
so , let 's start cooking these bad boys off.
now you could barbecue our burgers, of course.
but if you do n't have a barbecue, i 'm going to show you what you can do inside, so, just into a pen.
i 'm going to add in some vegetable oil.
so what i 've done guys is, i 've just got our patties, and i 'll just modeled them into a burger patty just like that.
OK , so you want about that thick for the best result.
so straight into the pen.
now you only want to turn these one skype.
keep turning them.
they 're going to lose all that juice, and it 's from the inside.
but of course, you need them cooked through each side will need about six to seven minutes on low to medium heat and light and slow.
because if the heats up too high, you 'll burn them.
and it will be raw in the middle, so about six to seven minutes.
each side medium heat, and then turn it over and repeat that.
so that 's the color where after guys without burgers now, i 'm going to leave them to rest for five minutes.
and while they 're resting i 've got some cheese.
i can, i 've got some johnsburg cheese.
you use whatever cheese that you want to, but i do love the flavor of this cheese on the burgers.
but if you want to use cheddar by all means, go for it.
so it 's as easy as this, just lay it over the top of that burger, and it will melt just sitting there.
so just transferred out burgers to another plate and using the same pen.
i 'm going to fry so the onions were n't cyclone guys over a medium to high heat.
just keeps tearing them to make sure they do n't burn and what we 're after is a beautiful caramel color.
and they start to go nice and soft, so are onions.
so , let 's start assembling these bad boys so it goes on.
top of our burger bun that we 've got here.
i 'm going to put on some tomato source, and spread it around, all around onto the sides there.
i 'm in a place on our burger patty.
i 'm going to spoon over some of those onions and goes just before i put the top on have a look at that absolutely gorgeous with the beef that she 's the young and who and just put the top on the burger.
here we go no, that burger is so juicy look at that, oh, man.
so i was being a burger you could put anything on there that you want.
you could put lettuce tomato, pickle, beetroot.
if you want to it 's up to you.
but make sure you give this ago.
because it is going to be the best homemade cheeseburger you 've ever had in your life all the ingredients to make this cheeseburger are below checking out.
