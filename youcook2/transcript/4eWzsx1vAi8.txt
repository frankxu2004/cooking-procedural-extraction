today , i 'm making a BLT sandwich.
but you do n't just regular bacon lettuce and tomatoes get a twist when i 'm making it so it.
just for a little bit of olive oil in the pan.
and now i 'm just kind of grilling these tomatoes in this span.
i want to get the maximum flavor out of them usually.
you always use tomatoes raw just as is, but i just want to add that added dimension of cooked slightly charged tomatoes.
is it the tomatoes are looking, lovely, and.
now i 'm going to cook the bacon you can do this in the oven.
but i 'm going to do this in the frying pan is just easier this way?
i do n't need to put on the oven right now.
so just spread the oil around and now it 's time to fry up the bacon.
i 've got very little oil in the pan that smell this right.
now so the ones that are nice and crisp i 'm just going to paper towel to drain you 're fat in that band.
but it 's also flavor that is flavor now.
all we have to do is just put together this sandwich.
you got some mail here.
you do n't need too much.
i 'm just going to spread this on the bread, and but i really like adding to it is just a dash of worcester sauce.
it 's just going to overpower all the other flavors of the bacon.
specially this way it just complements the flavor.
so now spread this on the bread, and, you know, what makes all the difference when you 're making his sandwich is the bread that you 've got.
try to get the freshest possible bread and, you know, i 'm making it as is.
if you like you can toast this bread, you can grill it, it 's nice any richard.
it 's just such a classic sandwich, had the first deal is of lettuce?
i always liked leave the stock out the dimaggio, S.
this is just as simple as that does not too much going on here.
but just these few ingredients i could give us.
so much flavor and at this point just sprinkle on some salt and pepper.
now i 'm going to put the bacon hair this is a bit enough for me.
and , that is your BLT sandwich to go.
