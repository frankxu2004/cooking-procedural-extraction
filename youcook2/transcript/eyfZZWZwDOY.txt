hello , james here hanging out in the kitchen and today, i 'm planning on making an appetizer what i 'm going to make is a escargot, appetizer.
so i 've purchased a small can of escargot at a finer supermarket and you can also find puff pastry there.
it comes frozen so i 've pulled some puff pastry out and then letting it thought for about forty minutes and in the mean time.
i 'm going to make some whipped garlic butter for my ass card code and today.
i 'm going to do a batch using two sticks of butter.
i do n't use precise measurements.
that 's just the way i cook so dice up some garlic.
i 'm going to put some garlic in the butter, hence the name garlic butter and some parsley from my garden and i 'll put some parsley in the butter.
i like to squeeze a little bit a line into there.
so i 'm just going to use make sure i do n't get any seeds too.
little corners and lime in there.
and that should do it, and also need to do.
put my bowl in.
and i put this paddle on there, lock it down, started off kind of slow.
i 'm going to prep the escargot for my application in this happens, they have a very easy opening top.
surla fluid that they 're in so what i 'll do is all alright just raining like this, and i give him a quick little.
rinse off nice big escargot, and i 'll just keep him in the bowl like and escargot, looks like this is a snail.
it 's common brown snail in the united states, they were n't so common before.
actually , they were brought over by french entrepreneur that was going to introduce escargot to the united states and they were n't ready for it yet.
so he went boss ended up letting the snails go.
and they became a species in the united states, your garden snail is the ancestor of that french entrepreneur that brought this nails over now.
my wife is vegetarian and slow.
she does n't eat snails.
so i 'm going to be making some mushroom stuffed puff pastry snacks for her, using the garlic butter.
OK , here we go my puff pastry has thought out.
it comes in a box folded up in third, so i own fold it like this.
i 've put it on some wax paper for little flower, underneath it, and i 'm going to use a rolling pin, an get a little bit more out of it i 'm not going to over roll it.
i 'm just going to flatten it out.
i 've taken puff pastry.
anna slice it into thirds.
i 'm going to make one with the mushrooms and two with the avoiding cross contamination of the escargot and the mushrooms.
i 'm going to start out with the mushrooms first.
so i have made a little egg wash to help stick things together, and i 'm going to brush it along the edge of the puff pastry.
egg wash works like a glue, then i will place a mushroom over here using some of my garlic butter for the seasoning.
i 'll just put a very generous dollop of butter on top of each mushroom nope puff pastries, loaded with that, and delicious is n't good in this butter makes it decadent.
i 'm going to fold it over like so and just press it down is this stuff gets softap.
it gets a little harder to work with.
what will be good, and just for we 'll show?
i have this ravioli maker, and i 'm going to locate the mushroom and kind of.
score in or the mushroom is i 'm going to go ahead and use the remaining egg wash for the top of the appetizers it only took fifteen minutes the appetizers are ready all that 's left to do is the plating we have put a little dish in marinara sauce homemade out of our garden and i 'm going to lightly brush the top of these pastries with some garlic butter.
hot , those are good.
i was are good.
