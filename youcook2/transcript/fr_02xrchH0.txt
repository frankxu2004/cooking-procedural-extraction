hi , i 'm carrie sarisky.
from french revolution food dot com, and i 'm going to show you how to make the perfect parisian croque-monsieur.
so here 's what you 'll need to make for giant coke mystere.
four slices from one loaf of white sandwich bread that has been cut the wrong way.
so the long way one tablespoon of unsalted butter one tablespoon of all purpose flour one cup of whole milk, one and a half tablespoons of dijon mustard five ounces of grated gruyere cheese, a pinch of ground nutmeg, some salt and pepper to taste eight slices of black forest ham and as many questions as you want starting our giant hook, miss you and hagma CIA is just a fancy way of saying the best ham and cheese sandwich ever.
so we 're going to start off with our bread i 've just toasted it under the broiler, one minute on each side.
so really this aside for a minute and turn our attention to the mornay sauce i put the pot on medium low heat and i 've added one tablespoon of unsalted butter.
now going to whisk in one tablespoon of flour and that 's just thickens up the sauce going to cook it for about thirty to sixty seconds until it bubbles up and against this smell like baking cookies i 'm just going to add one cup of milk, no skim milk in this recipe leave this on medium heat about three to five minutes, whisking every.
now and again and.
so i guess i can fit you can tell it 's thick enough.
because if i run my fingers on the back of a spoon it stays separated and add about a tablespoon and a half of dijon mustard, which goes.
so well with ham, then, then secret ingredient a pinch of ground, nutmeg finally about one ounce of the greer or going to assemble our cock mercia fat two slices per sandwich have our sauce or going to pour it all over the top of the sandwich sprinkle it, with grated greer sewing under the broiler just for a few minutes until the cheese bubbles up, beautiful, really welcome.
