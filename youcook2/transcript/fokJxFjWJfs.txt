hi , i 'm chef john min, switch for bout dot com food today i 'm gonna show, you.
how to make the delicious french classic escargot, and actually it 's escargot bergen yawn, which is the traditional method of preparation and bergen young just beans from the burgundy region of france.
we 're going to use some cans nail, some extra large french nails look at the label.
make sure it 's just snails water salt.
and the bergen young method is just a simple, garlic butter with some parsley, some shallots.
so we 're going to take one stick of butter.
make sure it 's off and tablespoon of minced, shallots, tablespoon and a half of minced garlic and a quarter cup of chopped parsley black pepper to taste.
that 's really up to you.
i like a good amount, an salt, to taste also which i 'm going to go with a half a teaspoon.
give that a mix and that basically is the recipe now, once it 's all mixed, well, you 're going to have about enough for thirty, two portions that 's about three quarters of a teaspoon.
per you 're going to drain and rinse your snails, make sure your ovens preheated.
we want a nice hot oven for twenty five and there 's three methods and i 'm going to show you how to serve this is the easiest one.
the second method is a little more interesting if you can find a gourmet shop that sells these empty snail shells, you stick the snail in about halfway alright, pushing about again three quarters of a teaspoon of butter, and they go in those little indents on that silver tray and that 's method number two.
but the number three kind of fun you get oven, proof, any kind of baking dish put about an inch of rock salt alright stuff.
the shell just like you did for the last method in just stick it in the rocks.
all this kind of a nice method.
listen to those.
bubble , and that 's it.
you just really want to melt the butter.
the snails are already cooked.
they 're so delicious now.
here 's some tips on serving you want to put a paper or cloth napkin down underneath.
so does n't slide around now.
be careful these are hot see here 's what happens while though, so good, i 'm going to grab it with my bare hands out.
so get some escargot toms right there specially made tongues.
they hold it much safer now.
do you have any cocktail forks?
let me try to get this with this regular fork.
oh , no alright.
so we had our cocktail fork.
we got our tongue holding it.
we 're going to stick it in.
we 're going to dig it out.
we 're going to dip it in that butter, unbelievable.
anyway , that 's how to prepare and serve.
snails do n't be afraid.
give it a try and enjoy thanks for watching to get more information.
