let 's talk about what we 're going to cook with in order to make pork fried rice.
the first and most important thing you 're going to need is pork equally important to the pork fried rice process is rice now.
we need something to fry it in.
i 'm going to be using soybean oil because that 's what i have access to and it 's actually pretty good from here on out.
everything is strictly optional.
you can pick your own veggies.
you can pick fruit if you want you can mix and match all kinds of things and make it taste.
however , you like stir fry, an fried rice, is very much your own choices whatever you want those ginger garlic a red pepper?
a carrot and finally pickled yellow radish.
it 's actually really good sorta sour sort of sweets or to bitter guys.
that 's all the stuff you need to make pork fried rice.
let 's go ahead and get started.
this job is best suited for the go pro.
so i 'm actually going to stick with go pro for the rest of these shots.
this is where all the action happens.
and this is where things are going to get really good first.
i 'm going to take a little bit of oil just a splash, you do n't want very much.
all this goes for all food.
but surfer i definitely the sooner, you add something to the pot, the less flavor, it 's going to have the less impact is going to have on the overall flavor.
you 're still going to be able to taste things.
it 's just not going to be a strong, so if you do n't like garlic very much add the garlic.
first , i have pre cut all of my vegetables and i 'm going to go ahead and toss them here into the pan that was really fun.
actually , i enjoyed that a lot guys.
when i said, this is going to be easy.
i meant in a very real way.
this is going to be very easy.
you want to be careful not to stop stirring because you should be running this at a very high heat.
and if you stop staring you could end up with burns on the bottom of your food, and you just do n't want that also.
this helps to cook it evenly now if you 're feeling really crazy.
and you want to get sort of awesome and do this thing, and then spill it.
all over i was going really, well until i looked at the camera alright so those are nice and warm.
so i 'm going to go ahead and add the garlic now, and i am adding a fair bit of garlic, and i 'm doing that.
because we have n't really had spices for our food, a ground dried out spice like you used to finding in the bottles and or the jars in the states are not super common here.
so i had to buy a giant package garlic, which i 'm not opposed to, i love, garlic.
i had to buy ginger.
we cut up myself, you know, things that are different in korea.
one thing you really do n't want is burnt garlic.
so after you add the garlic, do n't wait very long before you start adding other ingredients next, up is the pork.
and i have also when i cook this earlier.
i put the ginger in with it so it would just so the flavors would combine a little bit.
and i think it would be really good.
so then it 's not airtight for awhile.
so all that air all the flavor from the ginger were able to mix in with the pork.
so i 'm actually really excited about this.
so we 're going to go ahead and dump those in.
i can smell the ginger in and out and it 's just absolutely wonderful.
actually worked out really.
well , i did much better that time i 'm coming back to my old friend, the precooked single serving rice container.
now this is something i did in practice before, and it is pretty dry.
it 's definitely drier than i thought it was going to be, so i 'm going to make an audible call here.
i 'm going to add a little bit of soy sauce here on the fly to help moisten up the rice a little bit know that your workstation is going to get dirty when you 're doing surf.
like it 's just part of it and guys let 's seriously it.
you just cut up your ingredients.
you put him in a walk and you stir it all together and over high heat.
and you have dinner so let 's go ahead and put this on a plate and see what it looks like i decided to put in bowls today.
and it 's super simple just like the whole cooking process was just kind of nudge down out of there now.
one thing that you need to understand that some people miss last week when i cook, this food, i eat it.
this is for an actual meal that myself and my actual wife will be enjoying tonight that fit nicely into two bowls.
all that 's left to do is grab some spoons and dig in thanks for watching and joel, i look forward to your video.
