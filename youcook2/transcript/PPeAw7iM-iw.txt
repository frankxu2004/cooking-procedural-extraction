hey , everyone happy friday, hope you 're having a good day and a good start to the weekend.
so what is it.
you ask i will do on this friday night, i will grab some kim chiu.
yes , oh, my gosh.
you guys, this is such a good recipe, so easy so quick.
so , so good.
so come along to my kitchen.
and i 'll show you how i did it alright so since we 're making bok, choy kim gee.
i found myself a lovely bunch of baby bok, choy and what i 've done since a lot of leafy greens tend to have a lot of dirt in them i basically rinse them off.
put them, their tail cider little butts up in the air over a piece of paper, towel just.
so they can kind of dry out and let all the water trickle out next.
i 'm going to be pulverising equal parts garlic and white onion.
and i 've also put in about a tablespoon of ginger.
i 'm not a huge fan, but i 'll still stick it in an, oh, my gosh this freaking thing was not working for the longest time, OK.
they eventually figured it was not the machine.
it was the damn plug in, so here you go moving everything over to the table and there we go.
so you want to basically blend this until it 's pretty smooth.
i do like a little bit of chunk stuff, though alright.
so next, we got our hot pepper flakes, and we want some regular chopped white onion, because, instead of, like, you know, sometimes you add radishes and carrots and stuff you just want to add regular white onion and then also, there 's are puree alright.
next we have a little bit of fish sauce as well as a tiny pinch of salt since you 're not salting your vegetables i do add a little bit of extra salt and you really do n't taste it, it just call kim chi.
next then we have our rice porridge which is basically a little bit of rice flour a little bit of water and a tiny pinch of sugar just to sweeten things up a bit sort of take the zing out of.
although hot and salty things going on.
so last, you 're going to need a really sturdy container you can either use plastic or glass this one is plastic.
so that way any preventing is going to be maximized, well, it 's, it 's out for a bit, alright.
so on to mixing.
so first of all, i 'm mixing all of our admins, hot pepper flakes, going to add in the fish shash.
the fish sauce, i cannot even say that, and we 're going to add, are nice little slurry, the rice porridge, and just mix everything really well, you want to combine it till it 's a nice firm lovely red hot paste, very good alright.
so on to prepping the bok , choy.
i find it works best if you actually chop it in half which i 'm going to do really sloppily with one hand.
but i just find if you expose the little stems that allow us to make sure to get nice and cozy in their listens the lovely crunches.
the beautiful colors, george is so basically you want to gently mix this if you have gloves you can massage it in yourself.
but you 're basically coding all the leaves a little bit of time and then stacking them into your container and do n't worry about anything getting crushed.
you really want to pack it in.
so that wraps up the recipe.
and i really hope you guys give this a try.
it 's so, so easy to put together an.
it 's nothing like the traditional kimchi, where you 're salting cabbage for hours, and, hours.
whatnot this about fifteen to twenty minutes, all in all to put together so really quick really fast.
now i would recommend eating this within the first one to two weeks.
you can definitely eat it beyond that is, just it has a really different fermenting process.
then cabbage does since it 's not as strong of a green so it does wilt a lot faster.
and it really takes a lot different than actual bok, choy tastes, but that being said eat it whenever you like.
but we just tend to enjoy the most within the first one to two weeks.
honey , i made bokchoy, kimchi and send we shall see what he says.
you guys look at that, and he responded in like five minutes.
which is a good sign, so i 'm just hoping that i made it right, and it tastes pretty good.
so all this hype was worth it anyways.
i 'll see you guys later bye.
