but half subway cabbage, which is quite large.
but you can use any, any cabbage you like.
so it 's going to come off those stop there, pull up the outer leaves today give it brown.
and then i 'm going to jump in half lengthwise.
so we 've got quarters.
i 'm gonna just go home, and i actually get with any kind of really thick poppy seeds, and then we want to slice it up for the, the sauerkraut and it 's really, it 's up to you, have this, you make it how much patients, and you have how would unite skill back that the thinner it is similar steps or you 'll have any kind of eve.
your crap will draw the moisture out, so trying, trying to head up fairly finally.
and we 're just going to pop it in a bowl.
big chunky bits you can pull out.
it 's up to you.
so i 'll just keep going and cutting up the rest of the cabinet cabbage chopped and in your bowl, then we 're going to add some salt, any thoughts.
you just want some really fine salt for kosher salt.
it 's whatever regular table salt is fine.
i 'm just going to go about three or generous pinches is february cabbage there.
but the rule of thumb is usually one about one percent by weight but.
it 's really not super important.
what i tend to do is just get some sorting out and start messaging you, looking around, and it looks like.
so we 've gotten very like huge amount of cavity, but, you 'll be surprised how it 's going to pack down.
we pop it in the job.
so what we 're going to do is just kind of math lodge.
this salt in i usually like a bit of a massage and then leave it, sit for a little while, like a few minutes and have a rest and do something else.
i just so i do n't get to work without polarity.
i just hit my surging so, yeah, i 'll just give it a message for another few minutes and then let it rest for five minutes, or so, and then.
we 'll come back to it.
so , some kind of message for about five minutes been sitting for about five minutes, and i can see you can see.
like it looks kind of glossy.
now i 'm just going to have a little taste.
so say you wanted to taste a little bit salty, but there still really fresh.
let 's say it 's probably a little bit too salty, but it 'll have to do so.
there 's not much you can do it without too much solved.
the more thought, you add, the easier it is to pack into the job, easier, it is for the liquid.
come out so it 's not such a bad thing i 've actually found would have made it with less salt in the flavor and not being a little dirty, and i did n't enjoy it as much.
so no preference things, you just play around.
then we 're going to do this team is very likely.
if you had, we want to pop it into the dark and really breast exam really hard.
and that 's what we want to do is actually draw moisture out of the crowd, and.
because we actually want the fermentation happen under liquid, and you 're not going to believe this when you start packing into the jar oh, i think, you know, it 's never going to get enough liquid out, and in the end, it always does so.
so i 'm just going to pack in just keep packing actually probably easier going, and just squishing down BB brutal.
you 'll start to see the liquid coming, i 've got all that cabbage packed into the jar and you would n't believe it here.
like all that cabbage in the bowl has packed into a jar only have a feeling about half a jar.
it surprises me.
every time i do it.
so i 've just been a few minutes really, taking it down with my hand with this spring and hopefully you 'll be able to say that there 's a fair bit of liquid in there, it 's not it 's more and more is coming out with time, and it takes a little while.
and , well, sometimes what i do is pack it in, and i 'm not getting the liquid.
i just let it sit for five minutes and walk away from it.
and then come back to it, and it 's like this salt, draw the liquid.
i hope this burger in the background is this story.
what we liquid is really important because the fermentation has to be has to happen under, under the liquid in anaerobic environments.
if its error, the lactic acid bacteria ca n't do their things.
so just keep pushing down with this green.
if you get really frustrated, and you finally not getting the liquid out, you can always just top it up with a little bit of what her.
but the problem with water is it 's going to dilute the flavor of the sauerkraut, sometimes will get to a point where you just go.
i could n't bothered.
so it 's looking pretty good to me.
so we 're going so.
it 's not completely submerge because it a fair bit of liquid around.
so what we 're going to do now is just put the lid on and let it steve after a few days.
so i 'll check on anything tomorrow.
i saw across.
have you work on the side good.
looking , looking pretty good outside again ca n't hear any gas coming out.
but when i push you can say this hates of liquid there now.
so i 'm glad i did n't put any extra liquid.
and we 're just going to do just push it down.
so that the layers on the top of submerge, but, you can see the bubbles.
so definitely, looks like fermentation is starting to happen here, and sometimes it will take more than a day for the fermentation is to start kind of surprises winter.
here it 's been really cold.
but i guess he turn the hit unified going.
so that 's keeping warm enough.
so we just push, push down weed back on and then.
just leave them on the kitchen bench, will check in again tomorrow?
so it 's actually they for today since i put the virgin an i forgot to check them yesterday, so, we 'll see.
so it 's not, not a lot of gas coming out of the sauerkraut yet.
but if we push it down, you can see it is quite it 's bubbling quite a bit, and you can see it 's actually starting to smell a bit fermented.
i 'm actually going to, going to have a little bit of a taste, lovely.
so it 's got that kind of salty thing going on in a bit of a city, ten and for me, that 's.
so i 'm going to just going to push it down.
so it 's emerge.
i 'm going to put that in your fridge, and i 'm happy to starting it now, but i do n't like my style.
craft me, too strongly flavored so it 's really up to you.
know what it is that you 're happy with the flavor.
then you can pop it in the fridge and start using it.
