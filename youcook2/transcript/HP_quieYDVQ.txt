my mom and dad obviously italian.
and they migrated to australia in, in the mid seventies.
my mom she was eight months pregnant with myself.
and so i was born for an australian.
i 'm very proud to be australian.
so i was running features.
since i was nineteen years old this side of my first feed through melbourne, and i decided i wanted to venture off into more the traditional style pizza which is wood fire pizza, so, i traveled over to naples.
data course there with available.
it 's another data which is the some traditional peter and i decided to do.
that course, because there were the only association that actually looked at preserving and keeping the tradition alive around the world, and then i came back opened up four hundred riding.
so , we one of four hundred restaurants in the world that is accredited to produce the palton style pizza.
the italian word pizza competition is in italy they do have another one in las vegas with the one in italy is the biggest in the world.
there are twenty different judges on a panel and there 's also four different judges and each one is judging on different techniques.
so cleanliness up in preparation for the manipulation of how you stretch your pizza in the cooking time, every person has a responsibility.
so it is a really strict competition.
the event consists of six hundred competitors thirty five countries around the world, the earliest rent ever won the competition went into the competition not doing anything different to what i do every day in my, in my restaurant in brunswick.
i made my day by hand.
i also and as well, i found the best suffer mozzarella, which was DOP.
i also used one of the best flowers in the world that i bring into the country to make my pizza everyday using also bottled water which made a big difference as well, and obviously my limitation of my dough was very natural.
no refrigeration, and i went in there again and just did the same thing that i do every day, and it was a great result.
OK , so i 'm going to show you how to make a world class.
margarita pizza, now a lot of people actually, think that margarita pizza is one of the easiest pieces to produce.
well , let me tell you, it 's actually one of the hardest feeds to produce.
because you 're only using for ingredients.
so it 's really hard to mask if your dough has n't been produced.
and if you 're not using high quality ingredients, the reason is that we try and entrap all the gas.
is all the air into the dough.
so we create an AI scored any shortly, which is the crust.
so we 're not going to use any rolling pins as a lot of people, do at home we 're going to use ends with practice, you are obviously going to get better at it we starting from the bottom, all the way to the top, and we flip the pizza rover, repeat the process again and use from the bottom.
all the way to about an inch from the top and the next step is we place our right hand on one side.
if your right hand, if you 're left, handed the opposite.
so right hand on one side and again away from the crust away from the coordination and without left hand we then stretch and we come over to our forearm, and we hold it there.
and we go back down.
and so, at normal speed you 'll find.
that you will get this motion and now we 're ready to use the ingredients.
so what i 've done is off.
source , some of the best ingredients that i can find, and that 's summer tomato.
based in the center of the pizza and then we spread the tomato and again leaving that one inch border all the way around the reason why we do that, is.
so that when the piece of cooks the cord leash on it is going to rise in the oven, it 's going to become nice and, like a lot of people leave the crusts with pizza number.
the class is actually one of the most important parts of the pizza.
and i say that because the crust actually helps you digest, i 'm going to use buffalo mozzarella here.
the buffalo mozzarella into small pieces and just place it around the pizza quite evenly.
fresh basil and to finish off.
i 'm going to top this pizza with some extra virgin, olive oil.
now the pizza is ready to go into the oven, if you do n't have a wood fire oven at home.
this is actually the next best thing to cook a pizzeria, and i want to show you this oven is actually a stone base.
and so it 's nearly the same as cooking in a wood fire oven.
now one thing about the stone and a lot of people go wrong is what wash the stone.
you can even just brush it down and wipe it down with the cloth or, or with a brush into your next peter.
so , do n't please, do n't wash your stone?
now the settings on the oven are quite important there depending on what style of pizza that you 're going to make.
is the type of setting that you want to.
choose , so i 've chosen the classic setting that way.
we get an even distribution on the top and also on the bottom and the beautiful thing about this, i mean, is that you can actually look through this window, not having to open and close.
oven , frequently by opening and closing you actually, letting the heat out, so through the window and within three or four minutes, your peter should be cooked.
and i think our pizzas pretty much ready to take out of the oven.
