tell me my phone, affectionate send out a new york.
and welcome to my channel, my name is kayla and this channel is going to be about japanese cooking, and i 'm going to be throwing in some cultural and language lessons as well.
so this is my first video.
so i hope you enjoy.
and , yeah, let 's get started.
hello , everybody welcome to my first episode.
i am going to be showing you how to make good on today and this is a very, very simple way of making you do n't.
it 's not going to make the noodles or how to make the broth, or that she and definies it 's just very quick.
and you can probably make this in about like ten fifteen minutes if you push it if you want to rush so, yeah, i usually have this for lunch if i do n't really feel like cooking if i do n't want to get into the whole, i do n't know complex cooking methods and most importantly.
this taste delicious it tastes authentic.
and it 's really easy to double triple or make as many as you want.
so if you have a group over, if you 're cooking for you and your partner it 's quite easy to double up.
there 's also lots of ways to tweak it.
i 've shown how to add all the little accessories and decorations and toppings.
but it 's totally up to you if you want to not use green onion or not use fish cake, which is common buffalo in japanese which i 'll show you anything like that.
so it 's completely customizable which is really great.
easy and delicious so, yeah, i hope you enjoy OK.
so here are the ingredients will need to leave one packet of fresh is all an i use hokkaido goes on by newton noodle some broth and physical description for an explanation of what brass to use anyone green onion one egg samica, tenkasu, some taco, and which is pickled radish and some couple caught, which is seemed fish cake.
so first you 're going to want to boil the water and while the water is coming to a boil chopped the green onion and.
so i chop these kind of thing here.
but you 're probably going to want this site from a little bit dinner that when i have next, you 're gonna wanna slice the comma before the fish cake, and do n't like this, too thick, they taste a lot better when he sliced thinly and then escalate the which you want to slice about the same thickness or maybe a little bit thicker than that come up, or the fish cake and once the waters come to a boil and the noodles without breaking them apart once you add them to the pot, then set your timer for.
however long the noodle stage take on the package and add an egg and.
so now we 're going to make the broth and there is my little math jewish go measuring cup and for my broth i use a quarter cup of the actual bath, and i water it down with some water.
so what i 'm doing is just pouring into the quarter cup and then bring it to my mug, which measures out to two cups, which is how much broth you going to generally want for dish and i 'm praying in the boiling water that i 've already boiled.
so that when the noodles are ready i could just poured on straight away, and it 'll be hot and.
so during my table i put it on my little pig ghost.
now you want to take the noodles and the egg out of the pot i could n't film this.
because i do n't have a tripod, that sign up but, yeah.
so right now without putting the broth, then, you want to put all the little decorations that eggsy, comma before everything on top of the noodles, which are in the finished fold that you want to serve it in without putting the broth on you put the broth on last set when you decorating it they do n't kind of float away as soon as you put them down on the noodles everything stays in place, and you can put everything where you like without having it kind of float away and not look as pretty the attacker unusually goes on the side you can add it to the noodles if you like.
but usually on the side and also.
now we 're just adding the broth, anne, i did n't add all of it.
because that was enough for me.
but it 's totally up to you and, yeah, there you go there 's your finished product hi, everybody.
so i hope you enjoyed watching my first tutorial please let me know in the comments below if you liked it, or what i should change with my first time doing this and i was kind of holding him with my hands i was filming.
so i 'm sorry if it was a little bit shaky after walmart before i leave you going this here how, cause me.
so much confusion when i was first, i do n't know kind of getting into japanese or asian cruising.
because i did n't really know how to use the spoon i thought that i do n't know you just use it to like drink, the broth like you do in western cuisine.
but actually what you do and by the way, this is called the cheating gift in japanese i 'll have it written somewhere on the screen cheating gay and what you do as you pick up the noodles visionary in the noodles.
so i ca n't really do this.
but what you do is you pick up the noodles with chopsticks and since they 're hot, while they 're cooling in order to let them full faster, which i believe you set them also holding them with your chopsticks you set like the little base like the end of the noodles in the little area of the soon.
so it 's cool.
so it 's not sitting in the hot broth.
so it makes it easier to eat.
so usually when you 're eating you have the chopsticks in your dominant hand, which is my right, and i have the cheating gay, or you can just call sokolich spoon i think spoon, it 's been in japanese.
so you hold it in your that ten and you just kind of slipped the noodles like this after another fact about japanese culture it is n't considered rude when you are slipping through our soup actually your noodles i think, this was only appropriate when you 're eating traditional japanese food like the manor road on orsova not like spaghetti or things like that.
but when i was in your hand the first time i move is going over there that slurping the noodles is a sign that you 're enjoying the food that you think it tastes good and everything like that and i tried.
so many times to practice before i went over trying to flirt.
but it was really hard for me to kind of learn how to inhale when i was fucking noodles i guess that 's what you do when you suck your noodles anyway.
but it was just so.
so hard for me to like inhale and actually make a sound.
so the first time i was out, eating, i think it was a dominant with my host family i was sitting there eating them at a news doing it wrong, i would just like whole thing that they would n't say anything and they did and they 're like all taylor do you think it does n't taste good, so, that 's when i kind of learned that you kind of have to do in japan, so, i tried really hard and.
now i just do n't even think you better and i just end up doing it whenever i eat noodles like that but, yeah.
so if you see japanese people eating noodles and then my thing is slipping or it 's not rude it 's actually a complement to the chef, so, yes, just that little fact for you guys, yeah, this is the end of my video i hope you enjoyed it please subscribe i am going to be posting a little bento box recipe hopefully.
next week before easter, me busting my butt.
