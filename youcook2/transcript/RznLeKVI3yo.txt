having a healthy nourishing, diet is about more than just counting numbers in calories in your food.
it 's very much about enjoying the eating experience and there 's not much i enjoy more than eating wings on super bowl sunday.
i 'm danny speeds, and for this quick bite, i 'm showing you how to make my clean, and delicious baked buffalo wings now.
the first thing i did was set up a rimmed baking sheet by covering it with aluminum foil and then topping it with a wire rack.
the aluminum foil just makes for bring up in the wire.
rack allows the heat circulate around the wings why they 're cooking so that they do n't get soggy then to prepare the wings.
i gave him a good rinse under some cold water.
then i patted him nice and dry with some paper towels and then using a nice sharp knife.
i separated the wing and the drumette right at the joint where they attach since we 're baking.
are wings instead, of frying them?
i like to make sure that i infused lots of flavors into the wings themselves.
and here 's how i do that i start by adding in a tablespoon garlic powder.
chili powder paprika.
great color there a half a teaspoon of kosher salt and a half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.
now you could add more, or less, cayenne pepper, depending on how spicy you like your wings, and then a quarter cup of your favorite buffalo wing sauce right over the top then , you.
just gotta get your hands in there and mix it.
really , well, you just want to be sure that all those wings are coated with the sauce and spices.
and you could marinate these anywhere from thirty minutes up to several hours but since my babysitter is going to be back very soon with my kids i need to wash my hands and get these in the oven and just remember whenever the raw chicken touches you really want to make sure.
you give it a really good wash hand, sink cutting board, scrub it all down.
now i 've got my oven preheating at four hundred degrees.
and i 'm just going to get my wings on to the sheet that i set up earlier, now you can get them on the rack here.
nice and close and cozy, but you do want to avoid having them.
so now we 're going to put these in the oven for twenty minutes, then i 'm going to take them out.
and then pop back in and finishing off for another twenty at the end of the day, eating well is really all about balance.
and that does n't mean that we need to balance every single meal that we eat for instance.
super bowl sunday, i have full intention of enjoying some wings and a nice cold beer and all.
that means is come monday.
i 'm going to have plenty of water and make sure that i have extra veggies see the goal here, is not to be crazy?
it 's to eat, well, feel good and have some fun.
one pull him out.
and as you can see they are nice and golden brown.
and they smell amazing.
now you 're going to notice that baked wings do n't get quite as crispy as fried wings.
but i promise you.
these guys are packed with flavor once the wings are cool enough to handle you just going to get them into a nice big bowl and toss 'em.
with another half cup of buffalo sauce.
now i like to stick to the classics and serve my wings up with carrot and celery sticks, and of course, a little bit of blue cheese dressing for more simple and nutritious recipes, tips and ideas make sure you check out clean and delicious dot com.
i 'm danny speeds, and i 'll see you next time with another quick bye that delicious full flavor spicy juicy, dead on.
