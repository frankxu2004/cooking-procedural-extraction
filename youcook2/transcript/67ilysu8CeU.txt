hi , everyone, i hope you all are doing creates a lot.
sunday , my uncle visited us and he made his delicious chicken leg.
and it is the easiest recipe that i have ever come across.
so i thought i 'll share it with you all.
so , if you like what you 're seeing, then keep on watching for the recipe because it 's really simple.
so we have some oil which is already heated in the pan.
and we have added some garlic and khuman seeds.
then we 're adding onions, which is like forty five big onions.
you can actually drop it finally to small pieces.
i chop the onions.
that 's where they look really chunky.
and but you can only stop it in fine thin slices i have some tomato puri an marinated chicken.
you can check the description box to see what all we added for marination now, you can see that onion is leaving out.
some oil not oil water.
so we need to cook it on high flame.
so that the water evaporates once the word evaporate, it will look something like this, and you can see that onion is losing out oil that 's the time add in your tomato puri as you can see that up, you re, is not a very smooth textured?
thank you, re.
it 's like it has chunky pieces of tomato in it, that.
because that 's how we wanted it to be an now, give it a good store and make sure you keep mixing and stirring your tomatoes and onion.
because you do n't want to bone it.
but it still on high flame that we want to evaporate all the water from the tomato and onions.
so you can see the water just leave it like that for a few minutes till the water evaporates at this time, you can also add in some salt.
now you can see that tomatoes and onion have again who 's doubt oil.
that 's the time you add in your marinated chicken, just stir it nicely once you 've added.
that , and be careful not to burn yourself and not to spill it out of your book, just leave it like that for a few minutes, and you can see you have some water.
it 's from the chick in that we added in because she can, has a lot of water in it?
so just keep cooking it and then just throw in.
yes , i mean, throwing sub coriander in it finally chopped fresh coriander in it.
OK , now it 's always like up to you just got the chick in an you can either have a dry just like this, or you can have it linked to a crazy we decided to eat it with rice.
so adams salt, i forgot to say that earlier sorry sold an ad in water.
because i just said.
so just cook it for fifteen to twenty minutes and your chick in would be cooked from inside nicely, and it would be ready to serve and eat.
so i hope you guys find this recipe very easy.
i hope you give to try to let me know how it turns out.
and i 'll talk to you guys soon.
