talking about making sliders here that i got to start these beautiful potato rolls right here.
you want to make sure you get yourself a nice roll.
i 'm going to start with these rules next i went to the deli, and it got some boars head american cheese.
if you 're going to go good why not go the best, of course, here.
i got some ground round.
let 's get started.
all right, so what i 've done here is laid down a double layer of aluminum foil.
if you ever really thick stuff, then.
yes , you can use one.
but unfortunately, i do n't right now.
so the next step is take your ground beef that you 're making the sliders.
so what you want to do is want to take your ground beef kind of lift it up a little bit thanks smooth it out.
but you wanna make sure it does n't really stick you just kind of smoothing it out to the point to where you 're going to cut it into little square patties once you got it all planned out and you can use a rolling pin just use it lightly and i would recommend using wax paper instead of foil.
but i do n't have that not a problem, you can still use it, it will come up.
what you 're doing now is that you 've made it flat enough.
is you 're making those actual beautifully fence slider, patties?
you do n't want them to think.
otherwise , you 're just eating a small thick burger.
if you like it that way, go with it, but this is for sliders.
so here we go take a knife and just start taking the edges like that.
now you can use the extra meat to go ahead and reform it out and make more patties.
so , do n't think that you 're wasting any meat as you go along your knife?
start cutting the edges and moving it aside.
i 'm going to finish this, and i 'll get back to you in a moment, and here 's the basic idea of what it looks like the simple square patties.
you can solve them now.
i prefer to salt them after they come off just because it 's all usually falls off.
so now you want to just toast those buns, put him under your broiler for like thirty seconds to a minute depending on how high have the rack and how strong your broiler is.
but look how beautiful alright, so we got the burgers ready.
let 's put him on the pan here.
let 's confuse the pants around four and a half to five for few minutes.
yellow slider burgers there very nice.
be in a moment, alright.
so i got one side done swimming around in this morning with flight outfitters there?
now , are nicely cut keys, and i cut it a little bigger than most patties there.
yummy , yummy, there you go there is your sliders.
let 's finish him off.
really quick with the bun.
