alright , go so today we 're going to be making deeper two salad.
and i 'm probably going to be pissing off a lot of people in this episode.
because there are.
so many people who think they know the right way to make potato salad.
this is how i like to make it.
so we starting off with some olive oil, some grape tomatoes zaatar, if you 're not familiar with this you probably can get it at any asian or middle eastern grocery store.
it 's just ground time.
and i think sesame E seeds and some other spices in there in english cucumber.
half a lemon only see salt or pink salt.
but you can use any sort of slowly.
you see, if it 's politically you 'd like to use kosher salt, which is really good.
some pepper, and also a one loaf of pita bread and we need some tools we need just a really sharp knife, a cutting board and a little vessel to put all your goodness.
yeah , so we 're going to be cutting your english cucumber into halves.
we 're going to be using the whole cucumber.
but i like to just do it this way, remove the wrapping, and you make little cubes out of it basically so now.
it 's tomato time gonna.
be chopping up probably two cups ish of grape tomatoes.
you want to have giant heirloom tomatoes, you can do that probably about two is just really to taste.
i like a lot of tomatoes in my salad, so i 'm going to be adding a lot of news.
so now you 're going to be adding your pepper.
you 've solved and also your lemon juice, if you want to go ahead and use the whole lemon herbal development group, you 're also going to be active, your daughter, and you just need a little pinch bowl, and you should be good to go.
so here 's the part where i 'm going to try, and after school, so, i like a lot of crunchy pita bread in my salad.
so i 'm trying to bring this into the oven, an epic fail basically to sit for a few minutes until crispy, take a plastic zip lock bag and put the toasted pita bread in there if you have pita chips.
i like it when it 's warm 'cause.
i think it gives it a nice sort of texturing temperature difference in the salad, so and just find a knife or spoon or something.
you 're going to back that thing with and just press it down.
and it makes it basically punch it to these little shards of delicious, delicious bread.
so after you drizzle the olive oil, you could look like this.
i think it gives it a great presentation.
when it 's just got these beautiful shards of crispy.
bread , on top, but you can also mix it if you see fit.
so i 'm going to be showing you both ways.
so this is without mixing.
and now here we have with mixing both are.
good , is just basically to taste.
