all right what a welcome back to refine TV.
we 're doing another cooking show today, first of all, we want to thank the good people at twisted afrin for letting us use their beautiful demo kitchen if you ever been to a safer and they have an amazing menu.
i particularly the breakfast.
i think they have the best eggs.
benny in the city come check it out right now.
we are running our gosh, it 's gotta.
be our eighth or ninth takedown challenges like a biggest loser style competition that we do.
and we have about sixty people doing it in about twenty eight days as a group.
they 're going to lose about five hundred pounds pretty close to that every time you run it.
do it by eating recipes that we make on this show, they have access to hundreds of recipes, and we show them how easy and quick and simple and delicious, it can be to make recipes and lose weight?
at the same time.
so today we 're going to make something called a chicken waldorf salad, this is a take on a normal chicken diced chicken salad that you served cold.
but it 's got a few interesting elements in it that spice it up a little bit.
so we 're going to put some apples in here some grapes.
it 's got a nice creamy texture so you get into savory.
you 're getting sweet, are you getting the creamy, all-in-one kids love this recipe, so pay attention in here.
we go i pre cooked.
some chicken breasts here.
we 're going to put about three cups worth, so i pre cooked chicken breasts.
and i let him cool off a little bit now.
i want to die sees out probably the easiest way to do that is to cut him in half.
first , you 're going to put your hand flat on here.
and you 're going to cut right through watch your fingers through a nice and easy, i 'll turn it up this way and then we go i wanted the same thing with this one here OK, put my hand flat well, this way, OK number nice sharp knife, will come down i 'll finish all the way through there we go from here i 'm going to cut strips one more?
there we go and then we start the dicing.
i did n't season these chicken breasts before i cook them, which is not normal.
i would n't normally always season them first.
but since i 'm making a chicken salad out of them and adding all the flavors after the fact i just put the bear chicken breast in the oven at three fifty for about forty minutes, they cooked through, and.
now i 'm going to use them from there.
so we 're going to use about three cups here, so we got about a cup.
here i like to use a red delicious apple for this recipe.
i love the sweetness in the crunch of a red delicious, but feel free, is a granny smith, or any other kind of apple that you like.
so we 'll take our.
that 's a little more than a cup that 's OK, throw that in there all right we 're going to take that, see this grapes that i cut in half important there seedless, especially if you 're feeding into your kids, nothing worse than trump on a couple seeds are left in your mouth are kind of bitter.
so definitely insists on your buying, seedless grapes.
we have about a cup of diced, celery here.
we 're going to throw that in.
we have a quarter cup of golden raisins will throw that in.
if we have about a third of a cup of slivered, almonds.
those go in.
and for a wet ingredients, we have a third of a cup of olive oil mail or going to throw that in third of a cup of vanilla yogurt important to add that sweetness.
and it 's a nice little tank, or adding a quarter cup of sour cream light sour cream.
i like to use never go now, we 're going to do a little bit of black pepper not too much.
i 'm going to turn that around, if you like it a little creamer, you can add a little more vanilla, yogurt no problem or a little more sour cream going to blend that together, mobile better OK.
now that, that 's evenly distributed that looks pretty good.
i do n't think i need to add any more sour cream or male.
pretty good now watch how easy this is want to get your kids to eat something, make it fun.
we 're going to use romaine hearts or romaine lettuce leaves as little boats for this, and we 're just going to spoon that in here.
nice and even can when i got that going there more maybe stuff that nice and full heard that one to the side.
but never go how quick and easy was that you want to serve a quick lunch to your kids, you can even have that for dinner server with the side, you could have a little bread with it there.
you go nice crispy crunchy creamy chicken salad that 's probably different than we have made before the whole recipe from beginning to end, really should n't take more than ten minutes by the time you copy regence blue note, your wet ingredients cook off your chicken breasts and away you go.
chicken waldorf, salad enjoy alright.
so i want to talk to you a little bit today about some of the techniques that we use to help people lose fat through their nutrition.
that 's what this show is all about.
and we 're trying to show you how to make delicious recipes that your whole family can eat.
so that you 'll adapt these recipes to your lifestyle and continue to accomplish your fat loss goals without it seeming like you 're eating.
really boring meals.
or you 're eating foods that your family can eat.
so one of the things that we work with our clients is making them understand the balance of a meal when it comes to proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
i 'll give you a perfect example.
it will come up to me.
and they 've made some really healthy choices in their life, they 'll say to me, something like, you know, i 've really been having difficulty losing weight.
but i do n't really understand why.
because i made all these healthy choices i 'm drinking more water i 'm eating whole grains, you know, i 'm exercising a little more.
but the fact it does n't seem to be peeling off.
so when i asked him to journal for me, oftentimes will find this for example, for breakfast, they leave.
let 's say some whole grain cereal, a couple of pieces a whole wheat toast and maybe a little bit of peanut butter spread with them and then a glass of orange juice, individually are healthy choices however, it 's not a balanced meal when it comes to proteins, carbs and fats that meal in particular is very high in carbohydrates and there 's very little fat or protein in it.
so i do n't want to demonize, carbohydrates, you definitely need carbohydrates in your diet.
but the problem is when you mail consists ninety percent of carbohydrates your sugar goes, up you, digest that meals very quickly, which means, you 're going to get hungry again sooner and it creates an environment in your body that 's more conducive to fat gain and.
so one of the ways we control that with our clients by making sure that every meal there are some proteins.
we make it very easy for them, because every recipe we make on this show, in every recipe we give to our clients.
we 've done the work ahead of time to ensure that if they just follow the recipe, the meal will be balanced.
but i just want to iterate the point to you that if you think you 're eating healthy.
but you 're having difficulty accomplishing your goals that could be one of the reasons why.
because you 're eating predominantly carb or protein and it makes sense.
because carbohydrates are very convenient source of food threads even fruits and vegetables little rice whatever the case may be bagels.
and it usually made for you, and they take very little time.
but of course, if that 's the program, is that 's predominantly what you 're eating in your diet?
you 're going to have difficulty losing some fat.
so i just wanted to touch on that point with you today and make you understand that all the recipes we offer to our clients are portion to them and their balance proteins, carbs and, fats and that 's one of the main keys to losing.
so i hope that it was helpful to you.
and you 'll consider that when you 're making your own recipes that thank you very much.
