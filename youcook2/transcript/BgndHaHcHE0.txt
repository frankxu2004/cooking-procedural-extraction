hey guys and welcome to one kitchen and julia and today, is my every third number one hundred?
so what better way to celebrate that than making a delicious pepperoni pizza.
so let 's get going.
so for my pepperoni pizza i 'll be using some, you are far.
and we flower.
so dry yeast salt look on water, and here i have a starter which i already made yesterday you have to make that at least eight hours before you have to use it and all you have to do is to make some wheat flour with luke on water and some dry yeast start around, and set in the fridge overnight or just for eight hours, and for my feeling.
i 'll be using some homemade tomato sauce.
and some shredded cheese.
i have already made the sauce in here before.
so i will just leave a link for that down below my scription, so for my daughter.
i 'll start with adding in my dry yeast, and my lukewarm water.
and i just let it set for around five minutes, and now reading my salt and my starter dough and i 'll just give it a good mix.
just like that, and now i add in all of my.
we flower aloma two in flower, and i 'll just keeps trying until i have a sticky dough.
and then i will cover it up and little rise for about forty five minutes.
so in pizza dough is not on rising after forty five minutes, and i have already split meadow into three portions, and uh-huh, rope one of them out.
i 'm using a pizza stone in my oven, but if you do n't have a pizza stone, you can just use a regular baking sheet.
my oven is already pretty at two hundred and thirty degrees C convention oven.
i just transferred my pizza dough over to a fetus paid here.
and i 'm just going to add some of my homemade tomato sauce.
then , i add on some cheese and then our was some pepperoni.
i 'm going to be this in yemen for around ten minutes, but if you do n't use a pizza stone, it might take a few minutes more.
look at that book.
so the good it has a lot of air bubbles, and, that is, what i want in this pizza dough is just, so, so, fluffy and good, and.
