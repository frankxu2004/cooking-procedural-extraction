OK , let 's make this, so i 've got a little bit of oil in there, start off of it is a few cardamom seeds.
green card payments to release their flavors are not put in too much of a whole seat in this one.
they got her some chili flakes set up pop and crackle my oil be beautiful.
now i 'm going to go in with some spices.
i 've got two more equality cumin and coriander powder, now.
i want to go in with some garlic ginger paste, finely chopped ginger and god valleys, and then some onions i 'm using red onions this is i prefer.
there 's, there 's side which is stronger actually.
but they go to whatever you want this a good mix, going to cook that just like that for two minutes, i 'll be back, then OK just a couple of minutes that worse.
now going to go without meets i 've got some lamb here roughly bones in there.
i like to play for as well, and i 've got some movie toys quite small to sort of cut it up, and i little bit of facts as well, outlook side, for our flavour and importantly chili powder in this 'cause, obviously, i put the chili flakes in.
we will be adding a little bit of a freshly.
of course, a bit later this properly done that keep you on it.
but let 's do five or six minutes on that make sure it 's nice and tender.

so this, as well, so this was just, you are not any flavor whatsoever.
but it certainly will give it a bright orangey.
red sort of pandori looking color, of course be careful of your hands with this coloring stuff 'cause it really is quite strong and will staying in quite severely.
and , uh, some chopped tomatoes here.

they will actually make house source.
we may well have to add a little bit of water or stock.
let 's see, three four minutes in it.
let 's take a look now exactly, but tomatoes have broken down really nicely.
no need for me to other than water but depending on your tomatoes these were quite juicy.
you may well need to well, over the heat granny with some fresh green chilies.
now entirely up to how many years and i 'm running a little bit of ground, masala powder finishing powder really.
still , those in laid back on and.
because we 've got a few bones in there we need to make sure that this is very well connected there was no bones and it was just philip meet this would be ready right.
now by this get laid on low and slow as they say, just took this for about another ten minutes there we go.
