alright you tubers today we 're going to be making spicy tuna rolls you will need ya kanoy rolling seaweed, some ketchup and mayo sushi rice hot chili sauce otherwise known as rooster sauce.
garlic powder, some salt, or if you can find the combination this already mixed up.
an sushi seasoning ocina sushi vinegar and sashimi grade tuna have some already made up.
so this is what you 'll be shooting for, as you 're finished product, so let 's show you how to get there.
this is i have one cup of sushi rice that i have added.
sushi seasoning too this is basically sushi vinegar.
this is this brand is made a little bit more for sushi.
because it has a little bit milder taste kind of a sweeter flavor to it not as strong.
a straight sushi vinegar just add it to taste onto your rice on this race is cooled almost room temperature.
do n't want to make two hot racers?
these heart racing your sushi and some people use their fingers to put the rice on their rolling paper seaweed.
but i use the rice spoon.
it makes a nice, even smooth bed for your tuna, 'cause you want some pretty sushi.
do n't some lopsided sushi take it out all the way to the edge of the rolling seaweed?
like so that 's about i guess four inches or so, i guess you could say some great turner cut you a piece this about half an inch thick there.
take that piece and curve down the middle.
so you have two pieces, lay them on your rice search into end and.
this is your spicy tuna sauce.
is just basically half male half catch up?
and then, you add your spicy sriracha chili sauce in or people call a truce or self, which has a rooster on the front of it and get this about any store.
you can add your garlic powder and salt and, to some black pepper.
this is actually garlic salt mix, already mixed up.
so i just had a few dashes in their startup and taste it, see how hot you want to make it just keep adding this hot sauce in ticket, as hard as you want.
and then you just basically put a little layer on your tuner.
can i give it a little coding on all those serves there like sir if you want, more, you can add more, or less.
so here 's your sushi rolls stick it and roll it over like.
so when you roll it up, and you will need to have some water and above to wet your fingers in just take it at a low water to the azure rolling seaweed to make it stick it 's just like a envelope once it gets way to get sticky and then you just roll it right over there that age will stick itself down to the other side of the sushi roll, you know, you could?
some and usually one roll will make about eight pieces.
if you do i 'll put my piece is really big.
so i can get a have one roll pretty easy as you can see when you use the rice spoon you can get a nice even amount of rice onto your role newton is in the middle.
makes it really nice and neat.
if you want to you can add a little bit more.
your spicy sauce on top to give it some color and to make it just a little bit harder.
so they have a whole plate of spicy tuna, rolls ready to go, remember practice makes perfect if your sushi does n't come out perfect.
the first time it 's OK, just keep practicing.
and you 'll eventually get it, i know idea and good luck and happy sushi rolling.
