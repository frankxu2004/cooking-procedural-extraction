i 'm diane cuchillas.
a greek american chef and cookbook author.
and also the owner of the glorious greek kitchen cooking school on the beautiful island of ikaria in the eastern aegean in greece, of course.
so come and visit me today.
i 'm making a greek pasta salad with greek yogurt with a few of my own little twists, inspired a very traditional pasta dish from a greek island, called kassos, it 's wonderful, my little twist.
the traditional twist caramelised onion in this dish and a little bit of mint i 'm chopping my onion.
we 're going to do a coarse chop on this.
we want to feel the onion in this salad, and we want the sweetness to come through that 's really the secret that sweet, sweet this with the caramelised onion and the tartness of that greek yogurt that we want to get a course chop on this onion this is going to caramelize and turn a beautiful, golden brown it 's going to take a few minutes to do that the.
next step in this dish is to get the meant ready and all we want from the mens are the leaves.
so all we want from the mentor the leaves were pulling that apart we get rid of the stems 'cause they 're tough and i 'm going to julie and these leaves and toss them in with the pasta, right at the end do you want to do is get all your meant gathered up as much as possible and then take your knife just chop you want thin ribbons.
basically , if we call that julien, i love the smell of fresh men, it is just freshens up anything that it touches ready to capitalize.
we want a low flame on this.
that 's very important.
and this unusual for greek dish and that it takes a little bit of butter and a little bit of olive oil i want to get too much butter in there.
it 's really more for flavor than anything else.
this is just coarsely chopped onion in order to help, help this long.
i 'm going to add a little bit of salt to it.
the salt draws out the moisture and brings out the sugars in the onion.
and that will help it caramelize a little bit faster.
it 's going to take about ten to twelve minutes to caramelize maybe a bit longer.
and of course, greek olive oil one of my favorite greek olive oils from western creed from the area of kolymbari and this particular oil is called terra creta.
i love it because it is so fruity.
and you really can taste it at the end of the meal is so delicious.
meanwhile , i 'm going to add my pasta to the cooking water, which is boiling you can use any almost any shape in this.
i sometimes use rigatoni.
i sometimes use edi sometimes use farfalla, uh, the today i chose to use shells.
because i think with this dish, which has all that yogurt in it i like when the shells capture the yogurt on the inside.
and you kind of you must suck it out when you eat it, it 's really good.
this is exactly the color we want on our onions.
they 've been cooking for about eighteen or twenty minutes there beautifully golden.
remember in a little bit of butter and a little bit of greek extra virgin olive oil and A touch of salt and i can smell them there already there, so, naughty and sweet, i 'm going to empty my some of my pasta into the mixing bowl there we go that looks lovely.
the secret is just to mix it all together.
there is no secret.
it 's really easy wonderful dish.
i am going to keep just a tiny bit of onion on the side for garnish, i can smell the olive oil.
i can smell a butter almost smell the sweetness and certainly the nuttiness of this slowly caramelized onions the next thing to go in here is greek yogurt there.
we go and a little bit of my extra virgin greek olive oil.
no skimping on that, that 's what makes all our food.
so delicious little bit of black pepper and that meant that i julie, end earlier.
but a toss that all together and this is, you know, this is, can i say that this is the greek version of, of alfredo probably not.
but certainly a lot healthier than anything with cream sauce greek yogurt or something that 's captured the hearts of american diners we 'd love it, it 's really good for us.
it 's filled with protein in this a lot lower in fat and calories.
i 'm just going to play it this make it look pretty this is one of my favorite combinations of flavors to warm pasta salad, with greek yogurt, get some of those caramelize onions, caramelized onions on top just for some color and flavor of course that nuttiness and get a little bit of mint on there to make it look.
pretty , we eat with our eyes before we eat with anything else in a little bit of black pepper over that this smells so good.
i love this combination of flavors.
this is one of my absolute favorite dishes from the greek kitchen.
i have to taste this.
i ca n't resist pasta salad with yogurt served warm.
it 's out of this world, and that 's how to make pasta salad with yogurt greek pasta salad with greek yogurt.
my little twists the caramelize onions and serving it a little bit warm.
