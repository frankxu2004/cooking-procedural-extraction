sauerkraut is a bit underappreciated.
i think in my family, but i like it.
so i keep making it, and i use it for can as a condiment form for me to nasa 's to put it on some spread, or in some salad, or some fried up in some big and fat and i really like it i even like it raw who will and on hot dogs now, this is, all you need to make sauerkraut cabbage salt and some jazz deferments have to ready the cabbage take out the outer leaves if they have any problems take off this stem on the stop like cut a square like or a triangle like this then, i can just remove , remove.
the , the stock in the middle.
and i have to measure.
it , with this about nine hundred grams and i have to divide that with fifty.
and then i have the amount to solve that i need, that is two percent of their weight of the cab.
it 's has to be sorts.
and , this is eighteen grams, so this is the soul.
i need for this half cabbage.
it then i 've caught it out in a thin slices as absolutely possibly.
can i make sure to follow the curvature of the cabbage, and i end up with a bowl like this?
i add the salt, then i have to breakdown the cabbage to force out some water.
because it has to line in water to make the fermentation take place and see.
now it 's varisoft and very wet.
and that 's exactly how it should be.
and so i fill up that fermentation.
john , we have to put us much in as we possibly can.
and then we have to press it down because the cabot has to be covered in water to be able to ferment.
otherwise , it will simply rot it would press it down hard as he i fill up the jar completely.
and now it takes up only half the space.
the other way to do it.
if you do n't want to cut all that cabbage by hand or do the, the crossing of the cabbage is to use a machine, and i use the, the colour like this, this is about the same states where the it was with a knife when i did it the manual way.
but instead of crossing it with my hands i 'll make a final cabbage.
if i cut it again, i will force out a lot of liquid, so the fermentation can take place and, as you can see.
this is a final structure and the, but my hands are already word by this, so this is fine.
you do n't have to cross that at the salt and the mix it around, well, into the glass with that two.
the fermentation job and this is just a plain glass, john.
it does n't have to be anything fancy as long as it can become airtight, you do n't want any air down, down in with the cabbage.
so it has to ferment for at least three days, at room temperature longer increments the more.
so it 'll be this is after about a day where i check up on it, makes you.
you , see, you can see this a lot of water has open forced out of the cabbage due to the soul.
and the crossing i do n't know if there 's not enough water to cover it.
you can add a little bit not too much.
be cause the salt level is important for the fermentation and then if you just leave it on a cool place until you want to eat it.
so enjoy and you can find the list of ingredients in the recipe on kelly food.
