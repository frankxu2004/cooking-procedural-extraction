everyone is chilly today will be making chicken parmesan is really simple to make delicious, and i 've never met a person who does n't like chicken parm.
so i do n't make it now.
let 's get started.
so in total, i 'll be using two chicken breasts, which i 'm going to butterfly, like this.
you want to slide a knife through it almost all the way and then open it like a book.
you do not have to butterfly your chicken.
however , if the chicken breast is too thick, you wo n't be able to taste much of the breading or cheese and likes his taste, a bit of everything.
so this is this second chicken breast which i 'm also going to butterfly going to remove most of the fat and had a lot of fact.
so any sliced, the fat of your chicken, i should just slide off if your knife is giving you a hard time.
i suggest you sharpen.
your knife, remember a sharp knife is safer than a dull knife.
i used some plastic wrap on both sides.
if you only use plastic on top, your chicken will slide around while you pound it.
i do n't have a meat mallet.
so , i used a rolling pin or a rock whichever is closer be classy and using meat, mallet do n't count the chicken on the same spot, or else that holes in the chicken and he do n't want a holy chicken watch, my chicken schnitzel video you 'll see how i pound it out really thin he can certainly pound it out that then definitely did n't want this chicken to be thick.
but i did n't want it as thin as schnitzel either.
although the best chicken parm i 've ever had was very thin, you want to season both sides of the chicken breast with salt and pepper some people only sees in the flower i season both by the way, my grandmother was over my house when i was recording this and i had to give my on her 'cause, she really wanted to sneak in some other on the chicken pepper is enough gramma alright.
so coat your chicken breasts on both sides with flower that little part did n't wanna get coated.
but i got him, shake off the excess flour, and then we 're going to cope with chicken and egg i like to use one egg for chicken.
so i use two eggs total unique bag.
so the bread crumbs stick.
i used regular store bought bread crumbs.
i do n't like to use panko bread crumbs for this.
but you can use your favorite bread crumbs.
you can even make your own make sure to call every single piece of the chicken breadcrumbs.
also , i think it 's a great idea to make a few extra of these fridge.
you 'll be happy.
you did later on in the week alright.
so make sure you use in a fresh of oil to fry these in you just have to make sure every bit of bread crumbs, touches oil.
i cook these for about three minutes on each side.
i was going to cook both chicken breasts at the same time.
but i then decided not to we are going to place these back in the same skillet and finish them off in the oven.
i like to wipe off the excess oil.
but you do n't have to, i honestly could have stopped, the right here in eight, these just like this they look beautiful.
not oily not dry.
add as much his little sauce, as you like if you have guests coming over you may ask them what 's their preference.
if they like lots of marinara sauce, you may want to add sauce on the top and the bottom.
i only added, and on top i added some shredded mozzarella cheese.
i do love fresh mozzarella.
but i do n't like the way it felt i honestly think shredded.
mozzarella , melts the best migrated a little bit of fresh parmesan on top.
fresh bottled, whatever you have at home.
i also added a little sauce on the side.
so the cheese does n't run over on the side of the skillet in burn, sprinkled a little bit of oregano.
i placed it in the oven at three hundred and fifty degrees for about five minutes, make sure your skillet is oven safe.
make sure it does n't have a rubber handle.
i serve this with spaghetti, you may serve it with anything you like grandmother suggested price, whatever floats your boat.
this was so delicious.
it 's not really much of a recipe more of a technique and how to make it.
i really hope you guys give this a try.
i thought that little parsley looked adorable, please.
i hope you guys enjoy this video and thank you all so much for watching.
