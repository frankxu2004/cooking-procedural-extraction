who understand shallot duty and thanks for seeing into cooking with nona today.
i have the pleasure of having non annemarie and tell everybody where you 're from.
i 'm from piska to abruzzo, so let 's take a closer look and get to know our nonna.
i grew up in piska to in abruzzo, which is a region of italy until about eleven years old and then it came to this country in my family were four children, three girls and boy.
i learned how to cook when i was fifteen.
i was here in this country and my mother went to work.
so i was in charge of making one dish a night for my brothers sister was very easy for me to learn how to cook.
because a i like to eat and be i just enjoy making it.
i have two daughters.
and yes, i did try to teach them both that it cooked by one of them, loves it the other one hate.
since she only likes to eat, why do i like cooking, yeah, i guess it 's gratification, really do n't know, i just liked it from day one.
i always did as far as i can remember.
i like cooking, and we 're back, and we 're going to start cooking.
so tell me what we 're making nona.
we 're making pasta fagioli also.
and i like most people know, what is pasta fazul when the stars make you drool just like pasta puzzle i love it?
so what are we going to do to get started work on his personal failure punch.
and then a little bit of olive oil now, pacifier julie is really pasta and beans.
an it 's really more of a very thick soup, and we 're going to use kind of leni beans today instead of bottle lottie beans.
because why because borlotti beans are only some beans there fresh being shell and cook and they 're not available in the winter.
so our pancetta is going to start sauteing anne what do you want me to do we are going to chop some celery and onion and tomato OK.
now we 're going to make a base for our saas, an you could also do this all by hand.
but we 're going to use our kitchenaid food processor today cut down on some time.
so you 're just going to add about three stocks of celery there 's just chopped into pieces that fit an a medium onion and we 're going to add some peeled tomatoes.
so we 're going to put all that together and give a couple quick pulses, stop alright here.
we go just going to add this ask adventure.
so we got the base of our sauce.
going so what 's.
next , next we 're going to add half of the beans and the beans are really special part of this dish, and you can use dry cannellini beans and soak them overnight.
and in the morning, though, will look like this, but they take a little bit longer to cook.
so we 're actually going to use some giard kind of, leaning beans, so we 're going to add a half of these beans.
and , you can always use canned beans, too.
there 's nothing wrong with that, whatever you have little bit more there you go.
so we got half these beans here.
what do we do with these were going to few rate them and put him and put him into soup.
so that it makes a nice stick soup, sounds like a plan, and to do this?
we have are kitchenaid, immersion blender, and this is a really cool tool.
because it cuts down on clean up and you just whip it in then whip it out.
and here we go like a game looks that looks pretty good.
you say so.
and this is going too thick in our soup, really nicely.
so how often do you make this, i mean, i know.
i 'm not even from abruzzi.
but my family ate this almost once a week in the winter time.
at least the same with us.
it 's a filling meal and it 's a meal in itself, you have all of your protein.
your vegetables are in here and your carbs so you anything else, so what 's next.
we 're going to cook the pasta.
OK , and we have some elbow pasta today.
an this is n't quite the traditional way you would make it in prescott, a what would you use.
we 've use homemade egg noodles, cut into short strips or out.
apatity pass them.
so we 're just going to pro pasta and get it going.
so , our process in an what are we going to add to our site we 're going to add some hot water to make a superior to get ready to for the pasta.
so we have some hot water set aside, you could certainly use some pasta water, and if you use pasta water, the starch that releases from the pasta will thicken your soup a little bit more.
so if you like a thicker pasta for julie, you could certainly do that we 're going to do some plain soup.
we 're just going to use some plain water.
approximately a cup, a cup and a half and why are we using hot water so that the vegetables do n't get hard.
so how long does this have to cook well.
the soup probably half hour, depending which kind of beans you use, if you use the dry beans that you soaked overnight, it takes longer.
but it 's longer probably need about an hour.
but if you use already cooked beans twenty minutes to a half hour is very good.
so this has been cooking for about twenty minutes.
and we are ready to add our pasta to it that we 've only cooked halfway because they 're going to finish cooking inside.
are kind of leni soup.
OK , drained of order and if it 's not drained all the way, it does n't really matter girl just for a few minutes till the pasta, is done?
and it 's ready to serve.
already , i can really smell all the different things we 've added the celery.
the punch set.
so this has been cooking for about five minutes, we have everything together.
an we 're ready to taste this, well, i am.
so alice is great all those really nice chunks of pancetta.
so we 're going to add just a little bit of extra virgin olive oil all your cruiser, and making this little design 'cause i 'm five years old.
and we 're ready, ready.
let 's give it a shot and see how weather that is amazing, the punch after just makes it.
so special and incredible thank you for teaching me how to make this finally and thank you for being my number today thank you.
and i have to clean your cheek now.
'cause i gave you my lips.
