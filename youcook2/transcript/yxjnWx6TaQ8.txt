many have laid claim to inventing or popularizing the corn dog.
it is said to have shown up at the state fair of texas in the late thirties and early forties.
and as the pronto pup at the minnesota state fair in nineteen forty one wherever they first showed up we can all agree that they are delish.
let 's get started pour one quart of vegetable oil or as needed into a large pot or a deep fryer and heat to three hundred and sixty.
five degrees next add one cup of yellow cornmeal one cup of flour.
one quarter teaspoon of salt an eighth of a teaspoon of ground, black pepper, one quarter cup of sugar and four teaspoons of baking powder to a bowl stir to combine stir in one egg and one cup of milk.
it 's best to refrigerate the batter before dipping the frankfurter 's while the battery is chilling insert wooden skewers into two sixteen ounce packages of beef frankfurters.
it helps to pat these dry.
so the batter sticks better transfer the batter into a tall jar and roll the frankfurters and batter to coat fully gently lower corn dogs into preheated oil and fry until lightly browned three to four minutes.
drain on paper towels and repeat with the remaining corn dogs whether you eat these corn dogs with mustard or ketchup have fun and enjoy the taste of fair food at home.
anytime of the year.
