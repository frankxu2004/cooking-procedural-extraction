none , which i learned it from my husband.
but my style of making so dear friends let 's start how to make this non my style, so to make this non first.
we need one cup of all purpose floor and in this add pinch of salt and sugar, you know.
now non states little bit sweeter and little bits also add little bit salty and sweet add half a teaspoon of directly we 're not using any warm water or anything.
just mix everything together, and in this, add some oil also for nuns.
i always use buttermilk for peace, as you can make it with egg milk, anything.
but for now on i use buttermilk.
so here, buttermilk and makes it to airsoft dope.
so difference here the dough.
i mixed it, see, see not too short.
not too hard, this is perfect for our nuns, just mix it nightly.
this is sticking to your hand, you can just apply a little bit of oil onto this also and lastly mix once more, so here.
this is ready.
so just rabbit with the cover and let it rest for thirty minutes, and this will become double in size difference after half an hour of resting ardo, see here.
it is nicely puffed up because we added yeast it has puffed up nicely to cover whatever you call now.
add some just add some flour onto the table wherever you are making your nuns.
so just take a small dumpling.
if you want you can use the rolling pin and make this.
so friends just roll it into an oval shape, or you can make it into around an you can just pull also which ever way you are comfortable you can make it, i 'm making oval shape like this, just make it a little bit thin not too thin and.
now you and stretch just hold this site and stretch upper site non shape and stretch the other side also, like this.
so here are nandos already see here both two i made it be careful always apply little bit of dry flower, down so, that when you remove you can get it easily, you can just add this is kalonji, that is onion seeds and just press it if you want you can add if you do n't want you can just skip this we 're not making in any thunder on anything i told know my style.
so i make it i have a nice item card.

so what i did instead of using the front side and just using the backside.
so this should be nice.
hot very, very hot.
enough how are thunder will be nice hot enough, so this also should be nice.
there were none on top of it, it should get cooked very fast the similar way of making the rumali, roti.
so here are nuns are ready.
do n't apply any butter because it 's it becomes dark?
so you can just put it directly on the cover.
this is going to take just a minute to cook your non, say you can say nice bubbles coming up here.
so just rotated to the other side, play nice butter.
if you want you can just crush some garlic, and on top of it also, then your garlic naan will be ready, so here are nuns are ready.
so just switch off the flame and enjoy this hard at nans with palak, paneer or butter, chicken or paneer butter.
masala whichever is ready at your house, just try to make this nice wonderful nuns at your home very simple.
now you can just make it with your regular cover, which you have it at your house, and you can get your hotel style.
these are so soft and nice.
if you want a little bit crispy, then you can make your nans little bit thin, then you get your nonce, crispy.
sometimes my son loves crispiness, so i hope you also will do the same thing in your house and enjoy this wonderful nance.
