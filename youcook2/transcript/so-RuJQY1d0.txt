so in the same oil in go or paneer, cubes and same thing lightly, saute until their nice golden brown system here is nice and brown.
so we 're going to also pull that out, drain off all the excess oil.
in the same oil, we have we 're going to go ahead and add are in black human seats let them sizzle around a little bit and arholma, salas again.
which is there.
cinnamon , stick whole clothes, bailey, an black cardamom.
this time give it a quick stir.
and we 're going to add in our sliced onions, or, i mean, there are nice and brown, again.
we do n't want them to disintegrate while we 're doing this.
so just, a nice golden brown is good enough in this mixture, go ahead and add a little bit of turmeric powder and a little bit of our ground, solid that we prepared earlier and we 're using.
i 'm sorry we 're using about a tablespoon and dismiss allah.
but it depends on your taste, if it 's too spicy for you, you can cut back a little bit or put more of getting too.
you get that a good, mixed and little bit of sauls here and now, we 're going to add in our marinated vegetables will give it one final mix mister.
nice and evenly for that.
although it sounds like exploded on television and you 're going to go ahead and add a little bit more salt.
because it 's not enough.
but that 's nice limits.
so we 're going to go ahead and cover this and cook it until the vegetables about three fourths way done again.
the rest of this stuff is going to get cooked in the oven later on.
so you definitely wanna make sure it 's over cooked right now.
let 's check on our veggies see how they 're doing.
this smells so good, good.
now i have been storing that often on, you know, every couple of minutes just to make sure it does n't stick on the bottom and again.
we want these about three quarters of the way cooked.
and the way we 're going to test this out as i 'm going to take one piece of potato kind of put a knife through it right.
so it goes all the way through.
but you can feel a little bit of tension in there.
it 's not raw tension, but it 's smoothed engine in there, and if it does that, then, you know, it 's perfect.
so will switch off, or so, and we 're going to add back in our paneer pieces.
and also are cashews.
and we 're going to add some tomatoes.
another two again chopped nice and big and so as a lot of color.
i 'm having a firm tomato would really help yet or actually you can use cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes, as well and finally we have some, yogurt.
we 're going to be little bit absolutely.
this is roughly beat us lips easier to mix for that end, and just makes it.
so it codes even bigger and this process actually have to do very gently because otherwise the cauliflower will just break so just do it as gently as possible.
that 's it, it 's ready to layer.
OK , i 'm going to go ahead and just fluff up the rice.
one more time very gently.
and while she 's doing that i 'm going to cover the bottom insights of our baking.
dish , but some spray cooking oil.
so we 're going to put one layer of rice down on the bottom and basically we 're going to have three layers of rice.
so you can split your rice up into three parts, and you 'll know how much to put in each letter and on top of the rice.
we 're going to go ahead and sprinkle a little bit of our very animus, ala, just a little on top for additional flavor.
actually , this is also going to taste if you want it spicier.
you can pull the whole thing.
argo easy, definitely.
because it is a little on the spicy site and also we 're going to layer one layer of our veggies on top of here, and now.
this is vegetable buryat.
and so we are very generous on the vegetables.
you do n't buy into a lot of rice, then, you know, you get nice ample supply of vegetables here.
so there 's a two layers of vegetables.
so you can divide this into tubes, and.
now we 're going to sprinkle a little bit of our fried onions.
this really adds, a nice crunch at a nice flavor.
you can try to do this at home.
but it 's a lot simpler to survive it and it always comes out, so perfect, now another layer bricks.
and then after this, we just going to press down very lightly.
it helps it to pack in wales and cook well, another layer of our ground, masella, oh, yeah, something about one teaspoon of masala between everywhere.
so just a good measure and our second layer of veggies.
i 'm by the way, are often has been going on at four hundred degrees?
it 's preheated very well, and it 's ready for the very honey.
very nice and one more layer of R O, U S.
and are less layer of ice i would last layer is always a little bit.
lightest , on the rice, it let 's the veggies kind of peek out from the top and looks really pretty.
and now we 're going to do is we 're going to just take this afternoon, got a beautiful color, and he just going to resent around surprise this wonderful flavor, and wonderful aroma.
and it really makes you pretty funny going to leave some of it white, and some of it, you know, the orange color of the suffering that way when you mix it, it looks beautiful and final layering of our fried onions.
and also some cilantro.
beautiful , so this is going to be covered now, and it 's going to go into heaven once again.
four hundred degrees fahrenheit for about forty minutes that everybody 's ovens are different, so please keep an eye on it.
you do n't want it to burn after all this, up right now.
sorry annie is out of the oven, it cooked for forty five minutes at four hundred degrees and it is looking right at that process.
it 's nicely caramelised.
onions have browned and ready to see you, tefal alright.
so what it looks like on the inside.
and i think the key is to just dig right in all the way.
they would get all the layers portion of all the layers and it looks fantastic.
look at that see all the veggies are nice.
and they held their shape.
there 's absolutely i think that 's the key.
that 's why we did like big size pieces excellently, so this is definitely a meal all by itself.
we 've loaded it up with lots of veggies.
rice is there just make some right now.
and we 'll complete meal so awesome.
it looks good.
it smells great to join us again in another episode of.
