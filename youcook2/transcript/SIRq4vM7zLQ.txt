what you need of course is tofu, first, i can use any kind today.
i have this medium firm tofu from the local grocery store.
here in california a lot of them carry them, you are going to need the very main ingredient.
is this fermented chili broadbean paste?
i have this huge jar, but you can also find these small packages in chinese grocery store.
the next was spice is the suswam pepper.
what i did was toasted, uh, the pepper and grinded and then make it, quote, pour some hot oil in there to make it like a taste, are there things you would need?
is minced garlic that 's about five, six clothes some green onions?
and this is grounded a pork.
i cooked it with soy sauce and sugar.
i have another video on how to make these.
but pretty much you can use ground pork.
ground beef or ground chicken, an immediate fine, an here i have about two teaspoons of cornstarch now also chicken broth.
i opened the can on both sides so it 's easy to pour what i do first.
oh , well, OK here 's your audio soy sauce and salt that 's about one tablespoon full, maybe one and a half of the board broadbean paste here what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to cut the tofu in half horizontally and then basically about an almost, a inch cubes it does n't really matter.
but when it 's smaller, the taste goes in better alright.
i 'm i have my fire on high napura ballad, one tablespoon full of oil in the pan.
