i believe and, you know, you could make your own really.
but i want something fast, when i go home just want to make the broth and just put the noodle in there, and the server to my kids.
and so i could eat, and just rest and also towards the end of the video i will be sharing with.

two whole scallions, two sliced tycoons around one inch thick one teaspoon of popcorn on whole onions sliced in half three cloves of garlic, not bring it to boil with lid on once it starts to boil, bring down to simmer for twenty to thirty minutes.
add in your suitner.
i 'm using one third cup of coconut sugar.
three tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce, you could always adjust the amount, take out all the ingredients with strainer saving only the mushrooms.
the broth is now ready.
prepare your garnish, amusing zucchini.
she talking mushroom that was saved from the stock broccoli.
some green peppers thinly sliced carrots and minced, scallions so that you could use pretty much any veggies of your choice for topping next.
take frozen noodles out of their packages, make sure to keep them frozen bring broth to boil.
add in the frozen noodles.
stir to break them apart.
they are done when you see steam arise from the pot.
make sure not to overcook them transfer the noodles into a big bowl.
add in the broth, you could eat them like so, however.
let 's dressed them up a bit by adding our garnish, 'cause we do eat with our eyes first.
finally , sprinkle, some toasted sesame E seeds.
some black peppers, japanese spices, you could skip this.
however , it does make things little spicy and yummy are also the ingredients are natural.
some shredded seaweed papers.
and it is done.

this is my local korean asian supermarket.
let 's go find some noodles.
first , we have the dried noodles.
they do n't usually come with the soup base next we have the refrigerated noodles.
however , most of them come with soup days as you could see the soup base ingredients of MSG and other chemicals.
and this is main reason why i make my own broth.
now we have the frozen ones.
bayes , however, make sure to check the back for ingredients.
some do come with soup base.
i hope you enjoy your hold on.
