how 's it going at.
welcome to my virgin kitten.
you are looking gorgeous.
you are today.
we are making a BLT, BLT fit that mister T increases for quiz soccer game list.
so make this good times it looks amazing, right.
and this recipe requests comes from me.
i really wanted to make a BLT about four years ago, before already started getting to cooking and stuff.
i used to hate tomatoes at least take less, but the more of using recipe videos.
the more i 've grown to like BLT S and everyone likes bacon right, and i was thinking do i scan a special twist on it rather than being a BLT.
joy add some avocado.
but then it be like A B L, A T like a black distinct, the BLT if you wanna have been making this hit pause in the video now, right all these ingredients down super simple, you must, you must, please, please will start off by making a sexy lemon pepper mustard.
so in a bowl combine your mayonnaise with a dijon mustard around about half the amount of mayonnaise.
but you can tweak that you like in scrape on some lemon.
zest scrape on, i mean, like zest on some lemon zest would like a zester, you know.
i 'm saying and grind on some pepper and give it a good mix through until fully combined them back in the fridge for the time being in terms of lettuce and tomato, and it was crap yourself.
a knife shredded up the less and just cut my tomatoes into nice thick chunky slices, so easy.
right now with bacon, i want to get it nice batman under the grill for a good eight to ten minutes, turning it over.
but there 's nothing stopping you cook it in a pan or even oven baking it, if we want whatever you want to do, and once it 's done, it 's cut into nice little strips, or, yeah baby.
now the reason i really wanted to do this recipe video today, was i was on a training other day and paid five pounds for a BLT and the bread was terrible?
it was so thin like going to wash my face with it.
there was hardly, any less there was like one little sliver of bacon, and i do n't even think it was a tomato actually in there might have been a piece of orange.
i do n't really know.
but the really thing that 's going to make this recipe roman is getting some good quality bread.
this there 's a seated grammy loaf, so, so, good and of course, we lose in greece, we made we can stack em high.
so taste a purebred slice toast, toast it up.
and now we 're building, yet we build it by grabbing a slice of our toasted bread grabbing some mayonnaise and spreading it all over which will act as a glue.
piling on are less nice and high.
so , really good at allen at prom constant smartest slices, you 're baking strips a little drizzle more of mayonnaise and some more lettuce.
if you want.
too , and i 'm simply top it, that is, looking, mister T quizzes such sensational.
i 'll just say guys, and you want a little warmer rapid in some baking parchment like this and shove it in the oven, for and about five minutes, and you 'll be good baby.
oh , yeah, oh, my goodness.
i do n't know who invented the BLT, but i 'm in love with him right now.
it 's so fresh and particular mayonnaise is working its way through the BLT combo, never fails.
does it well, it four years ago, it did to me, but i 'm loving it right now.
and it goes great with a book.
