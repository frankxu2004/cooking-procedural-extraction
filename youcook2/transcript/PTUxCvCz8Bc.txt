hi , everyone, and welcome to new goes kitchens.
fast food friday.
today , we 're going to be making the most iconic fast food around the world.
it is something that i have received thousands of requests for and we 're going to do it today homemade, of course, i 'm talking about KFC 's fried chicken.
in he 's got budget near mondays.
what you want wednesdays fast fridays weather screenshot.
it goes you should wear satisfying meals prepared so the first thing that we 're going to get started on our fried chicken is just into a bowl.
i 've got some plain flour.
and we 're going to season our flower.
first , i 'm going to be adding in some salt and some pepper also going to be adding in some garlic powder.
next is some onion powder and lastly some prep rica, and just give that a good mix around with the flower.
so that 's what you 'll end up with a beautiful flower spice mix.
so we just put this to one side, so just into a separate bowl.
i 'm going to be putting in one egg, and i 'm also going to add in some milk as well, and just mix the egg and the milk together just give.
it a whisk, now of course, you 're going to need some chicken now.
the chicken that i 've got is some drumsticks and some wings.
if you wanted to do the chicken breasts or the chicken tenderloin you can as well.
but just make sure the skin is on.
because that 's how we 're going to get that really crispy skin on the outside.
so what i want you to do really simple is i want you to put the chicken straight into the egg wash.
make sure you get everything coated.
and then i 'm going to be putting it straight into the flower, and again make sure you get this really coded, well, they just shake off the excess flour, and i 'm going to double dip back into the egg and then back into the flower, and what that will do is give us a really crunchy coding on the outside and just keep repeating that process for all the chicken that you have.
so , once we have finished coding our chicken in the egg wash and the flower but the problem now just got some vegetable oil in a large pen.
and i 've just put a bit of flower on the egg wash, just in there to see if it 's ready to fry.
and if you do that and it sizzles and rises to the top then, you know, it 's hot enough.
so we 've got our chicken here or nicely, coded and i 'm just going to pop it in really carefully also with one of our wings as well.
so as we want to cook this for about twelve to fifteen minutes, depending on the size of the chicken.
but what we want to essentially on the outside is a nice dark crispy skin with that batter so guys it 's been.
about ten minutes.
you can just see here.
that 's the color that you 're after that beautiful golden brown color.
so what i want you to do.
now is to turn the heat off drain them on some paper towel.
and then we can get stuck into these bad boys.
but they ever guys, it is so easy to make the smell is one oval and just looking at their crispy skin on the outside oh man.
and it just check that out now.
i 'm just going to show you something just here on the skin.
i 'm just going to pull this back just so you can see, there, we got this beautiful moist chicken there.
and this crispy skin man hot to just check out that moist that you 're going to hear that skin is just peeling back.
wow , that is, yum, oh, so give this wanna go.
it is so easy to do so.
and you 'll have heaps of fun making it as well.
you guys, take care.
i will see you this monday for budget meals.
so until then, take care.
