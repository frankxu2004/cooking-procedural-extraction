OK , here we have yellow fin, tuna being cut for sushi me from shigeki.
she , he 's got forty years experience as a japanese chef sushimi chef yellow fin chinos, caught off north coast of queensland, off millibar, first up is just coming in under the wings chop, the head straight off.
he 'll scrap hills.
probably scrape the made of that.
it 's nice and sweet, made of there.
the reason i when your voice is, she me you should be a little bit careful who you buy it off.
it 's not so much about the fish even though the best fish obviously works quyen oil, but it 's more about the cleanliness.
japanese chefs are highly trained in, in keeping their everything.
nice and clean and keeping the bacteria nice and low.
hey is must most important at the ventures of spotless and the noise are spotless and their hands are nice and clean, which is all part of it, their trade , OK.
he 's coming in, hey splits it down the middle on the bloodline.
come into the vine OK.
actually inside the fish, there 's no well, there should be no dangerous bacteria until we introduce it.
that 's why the knives in the hands and really have to be spotlessly clean if it 's not OK bacterias, getting introduced to it and then we 're eating it raw, and that 's where you have all the problems.
that 's why you really should only buy sashimi off people that you can really trust, that know this stuff.
OK , comes along the backbone.
so that 's, that 's one lowing.
what do i have to be careful not to tear the meat?
you have to cut the meat away so you can get nice flocks of sashimi.
OK , that 's one beautiful line of yellow fin.
OK , i will get the other side.
we 're only going to do one side of this page, you can see it just do it.
the other day on the other way, so, there 's, there 's a bone that goes down the middle.
he gets cut through that around it.
then , along the bank, and they quite expensive fish, so it 's very important to get all the meat away.
yeah , yeah, big yellow fin only excessive a thousand dollars.
yeah , excuse my filming.
basically it 's very important to cut the meat away not to rip it as you can see also once taken away.
we do n't like laying it all over the board, even though the boards have been sanitized.
it 's better to keep it all open OK.
another beautiful loin places that over there get near here just dumb light scribe the bonds, OK the meat on the bone is very, very sweet, and an ideal for sushi, or, even, even roll for sushi me very easy, this with a spoon, no my guys OK and expert sushimi shift gets very little amanda weiss.
so we might.
we wo n't bother with the other side.
the other side you just repeat the process.
OK , so just move that away again.
most important from to clean the bench down, just getting some water adventures claim down already had been sanitized.
now we 're just trying to clean a loin up and cut up a few blocks for sashimi normally cuts it into three pieces depending on the side of the fish.
this is only a small one.
the smaller fish the lighter color, usually the less oil there 's also a lot of other reasons for less oil when the fish are caught they caught on a long line, and some fish are actually dead when they 're bored in those ones there are very low.
grade we stick with the live online ones with high oil content, which gives us the best, best tasting so shami.
OK , there 's a bloodline, the bloodlines taken out.
it 's just along the middle of the line.
hey that 's, that 's removed and thrown away, yeah, and we have the block OK, so, so, then it 's cut the surface is cut into blocks.
the rest of it would be cut into blocks of robot for this, just for the day.
we 'll just take the top off the rest of it, you disk in it and cut it the same way.
OK , now we had the block and cut the block in half again.
alright he cuts, he cuts it along the grain and then against the grain.
japanese traditional stall is probably a little, little thicker than the ice, install or west, install very sharp north knife, sending sharpened on one side, and they just cut straight back alright.
one thing about japanese chefs is artistry on display.
it 's all part of the display.
all right and there we go thank you.
