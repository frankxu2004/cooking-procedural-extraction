today , we 're cooking mussels.
i have got let me see what this is live rope grown muscles.
so what are we doing with muscles today.
something in it.
tomato , based that 's all i know, i 'm going to wing it, and hopefully you 'll win it right along with me.
first thing i 'm going to do get them out of package, and you can hear that seal.
you do n't want to unpack and cheese until the day or the hour.
actually , at the minute, you 're going to make him.
so i 'm going to put them in my strainer, and i 'm gonna make sure that these are very clean that they 're all closed and get rid of anything that does n't look right to me.
so in they go once i get all these cleaned and make sure that everything is off them.
like these little, these little beards here want to make sure they 're all gone.
cleaned and then will be back.
gonna put some oil on the bottom, right pan.
get it nice and hot, and i 'm going to put some.
let me see what i 'm gonna put definitely can put my red and white onion in there for sure about that.
i just report, yeah, that much how much all that much.
and i 'm going to put fresh garlic a tablespoon of fresh garlic 'cause i love garlic.
and we 're going to let that perfect.
jesse , i do n't want my garlic to burn stuff just want to release some of that flavor.
so i 'm going to go ahead and put one can of diced tomatoes in there liquid and all.
and i 'm gonna bring that up.
now had all these muscles wanted to make a minute black, bean, but i did n't have the ingredients and do n't have wine in the house.
and i do n't have beer in the house.
and i do n't have alcohol in the house.
so i thought, well, i 'm going to have to come up with something with tomatoes because tomatoes i have alcohol.
why do you ask because i 'm, i 'm just a nerd?
i 'm gonna bring that up.
get it nice and spot, and i want that liquid in there because that 's what 's going to steam the mussels.
so i want that quite soupy, but i 'm going to put some let me see.
i have a red pepper.
i 'm going to put a little bit of red pepper in there just to kick it up a little bit.
but heat i 'm going to put some salt in there and some pepper.
a lot of pepper.
and , i 'm going to let those flavors just failed and i 'm going to put in some green peppers.
i do n't want these to just melt down to nothing.
so i 'm going to add them now, not at the beginning and you do n't want this to be a really super high boil.
when you put your muscles in you just you want to steam your muscles.
you do n't want to boil your muscles.
yeah , make sure that these were superclean, took out any of the ones that were we 're open.
anything that looked a.
little , funny to maine just cost it.
and there was only three of them turn that up to maybe six without pretty quick, so it.
turn that up.
and this cannot mix them around.
turn that up for sure seven and a half and put a lid on it.
clearly it is great because then you can see when their open when they 're open they 're done you do n't want to overdo your muscles.
they 'll get rubbery like an elastic band when they 're done will be back alright.
let 's take a look.
take this off careful not bring south.
oh , that is, beautiful, perfect.
let 's take this up the heat and let 's go make play.
i 'm going to put some.
i 'm so excited.
i 'm going to put some pasta on the bottom.
any kind of pasta would be great.
this looks so good.
oh , my goodness.
and this is pretty heavy.
so i 'm gonna have to put it.
come like this and spoon, this beautiful muscle, i mean, look at this, before i even take it out of the pan look how beautiful that is off to die for so.
i 'm going to put muscles on the top and then made, look like a lot.
but there 's a lot of shell and that beautiful juice from the muscles comes out in the tomato is so good.
i , oh, i could eat this every day.
you do n't even have to have cost on this, you can get with bread french roll, anything once we have full dinner and in no time.
and i 'm going to put a little bit of fresh sorry home, dried parsley on hair curly parsley.
oh , my goodness.
that almost looks too beautiful to eat, but i 'm going to eat it anyway, look at how beautiful muscles, and tomato sauce.
i suppose you can call it lovely just with ingredients that you have around the house.
no , why no beer.
nothing fancy just stuff in your cover.
now , that is an excellent idea, and i have to try this, because i really ca n't wait, oh, my goodness, that is so good.
oh , you have to try that till next time.
