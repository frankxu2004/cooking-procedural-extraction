one of the most frequently requested recipes on the one pot chef show is full mashed potatoes.
i 've never quite understood why, because it seems like such a simple recipe.
i was surprised that.
so many people email me asking for this particular recipe until i did a bit of research and discovered that virtually no cookbooks or online sites have very specific recipes for mashed potato, they often requested for other recipes.
but do not actually give a specific way of cooking at.
so i thought i 'm going to remedy that situation by putting together a nice little video showing you how to make two different versions of mashed potato version that was pretty much everyone 's used to and a nice soft creamy version that suitable for piping or just having a nice sloppy version that everyone loves.
so it 's mashed potatoes other one pot chef, so mashed potatoes now.
the first thing that people need to learn when it comes to mash potatoes is consistency is everything you 've got to get the right consistency.
in order to make sure it all stays together nicely.
if you put too much of one thing or not enough of another, it 's going to turn into a mess, so, first of all, i have peeled and chopped one kilo of potatoes.
now , i 'll just this is in water at the moment so i 'm just going to take their one of these out as you can see.
it 's a very small pace that may be one to two centimeters square bad inch piece.
roughly you need to have small pieces.
smaller pieces will cook quicker and more consistently, it 's like any other carter cooking in the small of the food, the quicker and better it cooks.
so we put this in some water, just going to put the lid on and we 're going to bring that to the boil and let it boil for about fifteen to twenty minutes, at which point we can take a piece out test to see, if it 's cooked.
properly , the way you take it out.
give it a bit of a press with your finger, and if it 's sort of switches up, you know, it 's ready to go.
so it will start boiling this, and i 'll show you what to do next, well.
it 's been fifteen twenty minutes, and we just finished boiling the potatoes.
i 've dragged him off in the sink.
so first thing we 're going to do is just messing up with a potato masher.
we 've got rid of all the big lumps out of that as you can see because we 've cooked them the right way there.
nice and smooth for the moment.
so we 're going to throw in about a tablespoon of butter access offer.
and we just go to stir that through until it 's all melted through season with salt and pepper and still it through to boil.
it now, at this point, you can add some garlic.
if you want to make garlic mashed potatoes, you could add cheese to make cheesy mashed potatoes.
basically , this is your firm basic mashed potatoes done.
so you can serve as is if.
however you want to make it that smooth creamy stuff especially if you 're trying to make it a bit fancy, and you can use like icing piper or something like that to sort of make an arrangement on the plant then we can add something else you can use.
incra , i 'm going to use a little bit of milk.
we just add a small amount at a time about up to half a cup, at most and you just slowly add it until you get the consistency that you 're looking for as you can see.
i 'm just adding a little dribble of a tom, and you can already see that 's becoming a lot similar.
their own fluffier, who miss business that 's looking fabulous, just like that.
i will live and that 's looking just about right there, so i do n't think we 'll head anymore there.
so that 's about a quarter of a cup of milk cold, up there as i say, consistency is the key.
you just gotta add a little bit at a time until you get what you 're looking for.
and then we have perfect creamy mashed potatoes and perfect firm mashed potatoes first time.
every time, well, i hope you enjoy this recipe check out one of the videos at youtube dot com slash one pot chef show and until next time.
see you later.
