hello , ladies and gentlemen, this is chef grew from groos, cooking dot com with chicken curry in coconut milk.
i 've taken a band with three tablespoons of vegetable oil and will be adding half a teaspoon of mustard seeds to it.
we 're cooking at a low flame, and will wait for these mustard seeds to splatter when they crackle will be adding around half a teaspoon of jira or cumin.
seeds , followed by two whole red chiles will just let them into half and add them will add one bay.
leaf and one inch of cinnamon stick.
and we 'll add in one cup of chopped onions.
there is approximately around two medium sized onions that have been chopped finely and we 'll started this now, if you wish you may increase the flame from low at which we were cooking to medium flame will drop in around fourteen fifteen.
fresh curry leaves anne will sorted them together along with the onions.
if you wish to cook the onions at a faster pace than what they actually cook at you can add a little salt to this.
so we 'll add around a half a teaspoon of salt and we 'll sort of this mixture again until the onions turn translucent.
so when the onions are half cooked i have taken four cloves of garlic, two inches of ginger and five green chilies.
and i 've ground them into a fine paste, that is, what will be adding now to this onions that are cooking some people?
do not like, garlic so you may skip the garlic, but i 've used ginger garlic and the green chilies and together?
they make for an awesome, based.
so once we 've added this will give this holding a nice mix an sorted is together until the raw flavors of the ginger and garlic disappear after that happens around after five minutes, we can add one teaspoon of salt followed by a few more spices one teaspoon of coriander powder and one teaspoon of a red chili powder finally the last spice, that is half a teaspoon of garam, masala will sorted this together and mix it all up, make sure you have reduced the flame at this time.
because these prices may tend to get burned if you cook at a high flame.
so please reduce the flame at this time and.
let 's cook and sorted this for around a minute or two that would be sufficient.
so after around two minutes will add in the most important ingredient of this recipe, which is nothing.
but uh, coconut milk i 've bought a coconut milk that is scanned from the local store you can also prepare coconut milk at your place which is nothing.
but a homemade coconut milk.
so we 'll be adding a complete can.
now let 's do that.
so let me focus this is what i 've bought would be approximately around three fifty milliliters.
so just stare it with your spoon and add the complete can and please reduce the flame now, too low.
because the coconut milk tends to get burnt pretty quickly at a high frame.
so cook at a low flame now, there is a little residue of the coconut milk left in my can.
so i just added a little very, very little water to the thin, and i 'm just going to state it out just like this.
so please remember do not add too much water.
if you had too much water, your chicken pieces will not cook properly and the gravy will be too wet.
so we want a thick consistency of the gravy.
so we did not had a lot of water.
so we now steve this at a low flame and mix up everything after around a minute or two.
we will be dropping in the most important ingredient chick in.
so i have here with me five hundred grams of boneless chicken breast cubes, which have been thoroughly washed cleansed.
and i will add them gently here into our source that we have prepared.
we 've already added around one and a half.
teaspoons of salt before will add in half a teaspoon more obviously.
this depends on your test, so the total amount of salt that we have added in this scary is not to teaspoons.
we just give this a general mix and to cook this in case your coconut gravy dries up.
you may add just a little milk or just a little water at regular intervals, though you will see that i will not be adding any amount of water.
because this is the level of consistency.
i 'm expecting and the chicken pieces also released some amount of moisture while cooking.
so to cook them thoroughly will cover them with a lid and will cook them at a very low flame for around fifteen minutes and let this team.
do the magic?
the coconut milk that we added is pretty sweet, and, that is why to compliment it.
i 've prepared some tamarind shoes.
so after fifteen minutes will grab the lid and try to see the level of consistency.
we have with the chick in the oil.
has started to ooze out and you can see all the golden colors of the oil forming at the top which means your curry is now thoroughly prepared you can.
also , take one of the chicken pieces and grab them in between your fingers and try to press them if they are tender enough, you know, that the chicken curry is not prepared.
but like i said to complement the sweetness of the coconut milk we have a quarter cup of tamarind juice that will be adding here.
please do not add a lot of tamarind juice.
otherwise your korea would become very sore.
so one sixth cup of tamarind juice or a day maximum a quarter cup.
not more than that and to prepare this tamarind juice.
i just took a little tamarind, dropped it in a bowl, which is oven safe.
add a little water and in the microwave i kept it for around forty five seconds.
and then i had this delicious tamarind juice that i just extracted.
an added right now to the curry.
also remember whenever you add anything, sorta.
your carries at them at the extreme end as you have observed, we have added the tamarind juice in the end.
because if you add this in the beginning it would not have allowed our chicken pieces to thoroughly incorporate and gel with the curry.
so how to cook this pretty well will cover this with the lid and cook it for another four minutes.
once again at a very low flame and before, i do that, which is garnish.
this with some beautiful coriander, leaves this is an optional step.
but alive coriander, and i usually add them to most of my cories.
so well, cook this for how much time.
more is forty five minutes at a low flame.
so it 's been around for minutes, this beautiful amount of consistency of the gravy that we 've received.
now and the tenderly prepared chicken cubes within the coconut milk as you can zoom in with my camera and observe what else could we ask for vin served with rice, ladies and gentlemen thank you.
so much for spending your time on gurus cooking dot com with chicken curry in coconut milk all day.
