hi , i 'm holly grainger food editor at my recipes, dot com dinner tonight is cooking lights.
dijon , croak, monsour, this simple recipe, takes the basic ham and cheese sandwich up to the next level, so, let 's start combine mayonnaise and dijon mustard.
the dijon mustard gives the sandwiches spicy kick and add the spread to the bread to assemble the sandwiches top.
four pieces of bread with ham and then add greer cheese.
this is n't medici 's.
so , it adds a lot of flavor to the sandwich, and then sprinkle each sandwich with pepper and then just stop with the bread to make the batter for the sandwiches, combine egg substitute or just a beaten egg with milk and then dredge each sandwich in the egg wash it 's kind of like making french toast and add it to the hot skillet and depending on the size of your skillet, you may need to cook these in batches or if you have a griddle that works really well, too, let these cook for about three minutes on each side or until.
they 're golden brown and the cheese has melted.
the sandwich is just perfect.
and i love how well, grayer cheese melts like to serve it as a brunch entree or pair it with something like her covers green beans and a glass of wine for a fancier dinner.
i hope you enjoy this simple meal for your dinner tonight.
