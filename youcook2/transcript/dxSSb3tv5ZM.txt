so today i 'm going to teach you guys how to make galbi, witcher korean style short trips.
and these are basically just beef short ribs that have been marinated in a sort of sweet soy marinade, and then grilled.
so we 're going to start with some green onions just dropped two or three of 'em from the pole and we 're just make her marinade here.
so i would important component here, is actually?
pair so chocolate pear here.
and put in a few cloves of.
garlic , and we take my immersion blender.
just puree at all.
now what the pair does, is they contribute some sugar, and there 's a lot of sugar.
this marinade, but also i 've heard that the enzymes in the pair actually help tenderize the meat.
so we 'll add a few, a few tablespoons here of brown sugar again.
there 's a lot of sugar in this marinade and the reason for this is when you actually cook it, it sort of acts, like glaze, you get a lot of caramelization.
then we 're going to put in about, about a hundred milliliters of soy sauce.
here i 'm using to marry which is japanese.
obviously it should n't be in a korean dish, but i really love the flavor of tamari, and i are a habitat homes every video.
but you do n't have to use it.
you can substitute with brianne, swayze announcer.
any otherwise ask, but i like this stuff, then, lots of mirror here, we 're going to add about forty or fifty milliliters and again.
this is adding more sugar, and i like to add just a splash of rice vinegar just to sort of write it up.
it 's very sweet on its own.
but it sort of outside, then.
but a couple tablespoons of honey more sugar and then we 're just put some grants and black pepper and that 's pretty much it for glaze.
so you can just combine all the ingredients will give it a good start here and then just to finish off will just pour in a little bit of sesame E oil.
because a little bit is all i have.
so now onto the meat.
so these are just beef short ribs you want them cut across the bone, these guys are a little bit thicker than they should be.
but you can see the defining characteristics short ribs got a lot of intramuscular fat.
so they 're very flavorful.
but unfortunately this muscle gets used a lot.
so it tends to be a little bit tough.
so here i 've got about a centimeter.
you might want to go a little bit there that you want to keep them nice and thin.
so they 're not too tough to eat traditionally, what you do.
is you actually use cuts along a single ribbon, you?
butterfly the meat, but this way is a lot of issue is more popular here.
so for the zip lock bag and marinate for, please.
now or so or overnight, you can see that the meats actually turned brown there which means that they 're good to go.
so i live in a basement.
i have no barbecue.
so , instead i have to make do with my google cast, make sure you put them through definition and in this case looking to get fifty seven or fifty eight degrees celsius in time just above medium rare.
and this is the end result.
just garnish little green ions.
and you 're good to go.
nice easy supper.
hope you enjoy.
