shepherds pie my favorite dinner every year who grew up birthdays.
christmas do n't want talking about shepherds pie.
i made this back once a week.
i was make it in bulk.
because it 's really easy to make and really easy to store a great to zip out after work or after school when you had a long day do n't really fancy cooking.
so what i 'm going to do is take you over to the stove gas on i put a splash of olive oil in there.
so it fried onions are using quite a lot.
they are ready chopped ready for slow cooked in olive oil.
recommended by lots of top chefs, regions is literally onions olive oil, and, that is, it.
so , i think you thought, you feel quite justified in using some people find it hard to coconet buying a tin of onions or buying a packet ready prepared onions is going to make you help you cook something home cooked then, well, yeah, just do it, do n't feel guilty about it?
nice organic moments, today.
and this is just going into brown, it D clump.
and , once that, it 's all ground will put the stock in and anything slow cooked tastes amazing alright.
i do n't know.
sometimes you get minutes and it 's not properly.
cook , discovered brain.
it 's all clumped together, and it 's really horrible this way.
there 's no danger.
factors will just melt it down it 's just delicious, so that 's all nicely browned now say nicely does n't.
actually , that 's so we look at the isolator now the liquid.
i 've got some beef stock here.
i 'm going to pull that all in look at eight hundred grams of meat here in about eight hundred milliliters of stock, and i 'm going to corbett of tomato sauce in clash of liam, pairings , yum.
was just your sauce brings everything to life going to hilton at this stage?
just , put intend fell over the top lid big, enough and check it after three hours.
so my shepherds pie meat sources been bubbling away in the oven for about four hours, and i just checked this really reduce down nicely except lovely.
it 's ready to come out about halfway through.
i put some time in to get better flavor and some small salt and pepper when i text how it was cooking whether it needed it.
so that 's just going the bottom.
normally what i would do is have a mash on top of this, and then ridge it up and grated cheese on top.
yum , but today, i am going to use some cauliflower cheese, which is a kind of really different way of doing it.
but really nice and really tasty and all the flavors work really, well together and it also means you 've got your vegetables in your main dish as well as you do n't have to do anything else on the side.
so in here i 've made you if you followed last week you make cauliflower cheese and literally going to just put that on top and then you 're going to put crumbs and parmesan cheese on top and one of the nice things about this is.
because it 's quite a texture talk.
we bake it in the oven, is really crunchy?
so , i think that 's probably just the perfect amount going to make it just a small dish will be about half an hour until its public on top and heated all the way through.
but yes, delicious, oh, yum, yum, yum.
so i do n't know what we 're going to name this kind of cauliflower shepherds, cauliflower shepherds, college shepherds.
i should be only, yeah, it does anyway, let 's get some colleagues juice crunchy with that.
really where to go unusual twist on a classic cauliflower cheese on a ship, in spite bottom beautiful, try it.
let us know what you think so.
we 're sisters and together where crimes we both like cooking, and we love food and chocolate and red wine.
