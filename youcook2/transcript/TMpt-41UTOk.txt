hi , i 'm on ya welcome to my kitchen.
today , i 'm going to show you how to prevent kiragi.
this is a recipe.
i got from my mom, and we 're going to be preparing today.
payroll zinnias, which is V rocking with meat and those are favorite of sebastians, and there are.
so many different types of P rocket that can be done with meet with cabbage with fruits sweet, sour spicy whichever, whichever way.
you want to go you can go with pierogi, but today.
let 's make sebastian happy and have a look at the ingredients so you know, what you mean i am starting with my need.
i 'm putting it into the large part together with half of the onion.
my tried mushrooms.
leave few peppercorns and a teaspoon of salt.
and then i 'm going to add enough water just to cover the meat here we go OK and then on the.
medium , medium high heat.
i 'm going to be cooking it for an hour right and this is ready.
now it 's time to fish it out.
so we take our onion.
the dried mushrooms and the meat out.
then we let it cool it a little bit.
so it does n't.
but in our fingers.
but the stock you want to keep.
because you might need it later it 's pretty hot.
so i would n't use it for anything else, but we might need few tablespoon.
or a half a cup for the stuffing later on OK, i will put me to cool down a little bit.
and i 'm going to cut it into smaller pieces.
just so it 's easier to use the grinder later.
here we go and through the grinder calls to meet the onion and dried mushrooms.
now if you do not have a grinder you can use the food processor for that, as well.
you just need, just need to make sure that limit is very well processed.
here we go in ghost union and in my shorts and then on my frank pan, i have around the tablespoon of oil, providing my onion.
that 's the other half of the onion, which i chopped finely, and i 'm going to be cooking it for three four minutes until it 's nice.
softon glass just like that and now we adding our onion to the meat and then adding some salt and pepper.
OK , now we start mixing it, so, first i 'm working with my spoon.
and then i 'm switching to my hand i 'm going to be working on my meat for around.
five , seven minutes just needs to get elastic and in my case, it was a little bit dry.
so , i added a half a cup of the, of the juice again of the stock.
sorry , and then we work in some more, and now the best thing is to do the stuff in one day.
and then the P.
rocky , the other day, but you could do with right, right now, but for me that was evening.
and i just packed it nicely with the aluminium.
foil and i put it in the fridge.
now , the next day i started with booting water into my largest pot, other the teaspoon of salt.
and let it bring to a boil and in the meantime into my foot processor i 'm adding the flower is and then the spoon of salt and then i 'm going to process it just a little bit.
so the salt mixes with the flower here we go with pulses full-time sears.
he would go.
it 's done and then slowly here in the cup.
i have water which was just boiling.
it 's not boiling hot, but it 's still very, very warm.
very slowly, i 'm adding it into my food processor and as you can see when it starts forming a ball like this.
i 'm checking if its oft and then you should run it for another minute or so, and then it 's ready.
here we go with lightly flour the surface transfer, our donate and.
now i 'm going to need it few times.
but it gets elastic and not sticky very quickly.
OK , so now i 'm cutting it in half one half.
i 'm puting for later on into a zip lock bag and the other half we going to be rolling and it 's a lot of rolling and slipping that.
also , it does n't stick to the table.
here we go we wanna, roll it pretty thin between one and two millimeters.
it also depends how you like it, you might want it a little bit thicker, or a little bit thinner for me.
i like it around to millimeters.
i do n't like it too thin.
let me go.
and then with my glass i 'm cutting circles and then i 'm taking the remaining, though.
and i 'm going to put it added to the rest of the air.
we go to into my lip lock bag just so does n't try out.
and we can still use it now.
i 'm sprinkling with the flower.
because i do n't want my pirocchi to stick, and then i 'm putting water on the side, just my mom told me that in case might be rockier getting to dry, and they do n't want to close.
i want to put a little bit of water on the edges.
i did not have that problem.
OK , so i 'm picking up my dough very important.
the circles you want to flip it over.
so you closing it with the size, which was laying on the table.
you put one tablespoon of the staffing and then you nicely close it, and then at the end.
i added a little bit of a decoration there here we go so you stretch it out yet then you flip it and then tablespoon of staffing with squeeze it in kind of we stretched the door around here we go close it and make a low decoration here we go OK.
so when we done with all the circles, our water is boiling now.
so gently and carefully, so you do n't get burned you put all your pure oak inside.
now to not overcrowd, if you do n't have the big pot like this, just make it in, in portions play, with the wooden spoon.
i 'm going to steer it a little bit.
so they do n't stuck to the bottom and then when they float up another minute, and they already.
so i spread my serving plate with a non stick , spray.
and it 's time to fish out our pero game.
we , we go off to go OK and.
now we want to spray them on top as well, with a little bit of a non stick, spray and then there are many ways of serving pirocchi.
but one of them is just to fry them on a little bit of oil in this favorite of sebastian.
so that 's what i 'm doing here.
but you could just serve them from water with some sour cream, you could serve them with some flight on your own, or with some fried bacon and onion, different ways.
but today, we going to serve them.
that 's how it looks like i hope guys, you enjoy the recipe you.
please let me know what you think.
and i will see you next time.
