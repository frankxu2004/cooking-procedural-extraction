hey guys this day, but no risk required, and it is cinco de mayo.
so what we 're going to do is celebrate with a little bit of tacos barbacoa now.
traditionally , this is a really complex recipe that 's where the word barbecue comes from.
we 're going to, we 're not going to go traditional and put it in a pit trap and leaves all that craziness.
we 're just going to see rob some short ribs which is my favorite cut for one for these beef barbecue.
the meat becomes.
so tender and succulent super flavorful going to sear it off.
but most of the work is going to be done in the slow cooker, which super easy, put it in you walk, away few hours.
you 're all good and done today.
i 'm coming in with a few of my taste, made partners were all doing kind of these cinco de mayo recipes, look through them.
i 'm going to link to them, an i 'm sure going to find some other great recipes for parties for just a family night at home hey, even if you just want to pop open a few margaritas or down a few margaritas and cook some of these up i think you 're going to have an awesome time.
let 's go ahead and get started OK.
let 's get started on our beef barbacoa, tacos, i 've got a pan here high heat, or you can use a couple different cut to me i 'm using some boneless short room seasoned really well and i 'm going to start the recipe by actually searing them off in a pan.
now barbakow after barbecue comes around this is going to help give our tacos a little bit of that charge flavor if you want take an extra step go ahead and do this on the grill and just use a super hot grill get, it nice and charge if you want to skip this step go ahead and do that to turn out OK just a little different, you want to get nice and dark, do n't touch it for a couple minutes all sides then we 'll come back here throw everything in the slow cooker.
so i 've got our meat brown and while that happens i 'm just going to quickly, quickly, quickly char off at the CIA pepper that i cut in half and E seated i 'm not looking to get this like all the skin blackened, or anything like that i just want a couple of dark spots on it again it 's the kind of barbecue flavor that i 'm trying to go for here it will take about two minutes or.
so to get there into the same thing i 've gotten a dried hancho chili here actually i 've got three.
so i 'm just going to give this a little bit heat, you know, literally like ten seconds on each side right over the flame that 's going to release some of those oils and help the, help the pepper really kind of flavor are sauce in the slow cooker.
so i got about four pounds ashore room.
so i 'm moving in batches.
but let me show you what we 're looking at this nice golden brown color that 's what we 're trying to get to that 's going to super rich deep, dark flavors to our barbacoa let me finish up and then we 're going to move everything into the slow cooker OK.
so we 've got our slow cooker set up.
now if you want to do this in like a dutch oven on the stove you absolutely can we 've got that uhm, pacea pepper that we just fairly roasted like he can see, see just a tiny little bit of charter you definitely do n't want it all black i 've got the an shows that we threw out there as well toss them in whole no big deal i 've got a yellow onion and about five clothes of garlic that i just crush down you do n't need to be too fancy i 've got two cans of fire roasted tomatoes this is what one pound cans and that fire roasted it 's another way to get that charred flavor in there i got half a line will give it a little squeeze their lives, got no juice get a little bit in there a little bit of wister schuster shia, A touch of honey, which i think is really nice soil sweetness on there maybe two tablespoons and then for spices i 'm using TSP, a heavy teaspoon of oregano, and i can find it my kumon probably two tablespoons of kumon you do n't want to be shy there and then finally all that wonderful pan drippings from the, from the short room i just threw some chicken stock in the pan deglaze it picked up all of that yummy flavor and then we 've got our short rib pieces, which i 'm just going to add back to the pen and i will do it fast.
now i 'm going to add a little bit more water in here 'cause you want it and about halfway filled halfway up the meat with liquid and this is all kind of meltdown.
but over the.
next few hours we 're going to let it go on low should be just kind of barely simmering for about three hours, and this meat is going to go from super tough, an chewy right.
now to super, super tender succulent, all those flavors long fuse going to be absolutely awesome.
so depending on the thickness or the size of the chunks of beef that you got they will take like three to six hours or.
so until it becomes just fork tender and you can easily break it apart like that.
so yummy, anxious, absolutely delicious go ahead let the pieces rest kind of big pieces like that for ten or fifteen minutes before you do this and then just pulled apart gently, that 's going to be our taco filling as, as you wait you can reduce down some of that braising liquid and use that frankly as a source of the tacos that 'll be absolutely awesome OK.
let 's go ahead and finish up these cinco, tamayo, barba, koa tacos i 've got shredded meat here this, like i said, i reduced down some of the braising liquid little extra flavor there is going to make this absolutely awesome you do n't really want to think of it like a salad dress right, you do n't want swimming in that sauce just want a little bit extra flavor there to taste it one more time before you, before you serve it up this one was right on for salt and pepper play a nice hefty dose i have three warmed flour or corn tortillas here, compile that meet nice and high and then, you know, toppings use whatever you want i 'm gonna go with a little bit i ca n't resist, i gotta eat that low piece a little bit, if you could a guy on here right on the side let it overflow, i like serving on a board like this sometimes too you can be pretty cool make a whole bunch of random L out to the party and then why not, i got a little bit of guacamole on there too and this has been an absolute pleasure cooking for you guys on sink in a mile i hope you give these tacos to try, and i 'll see you.
