anybody the boys homas needs to watch this because it will taste fantastic.
and it 's going to taste much better than what you buy at the supermarket.
little blender perfect for the job can of drained chickpeas.
next up lemon juice lemon zest, i 'm just going to put in a little bit of the lemon zest outright groan and get a little testy.
it 's probably the best of half a lemon, do n't think we need the whole one especially with a microplane.
because you get an enormous amount of desktop.
but then we just roll that lemon just to sort of break the segments inside, just to release the juice, and i 'm just going to squeeze the juice of that lemon in obviously just using that little save.
because they do n't want the hips in.
next up half a clove of garlic and then this is denny, this is organic tahini, which is beautiful, and tahini is a ground sesame E seed.
so it 's ground into a paste.
but like peanut butter that 's essentially what it is.
so i normally put in a good spoonful of tahini 'cause i love the stuff and then a little pinch of mild paprika little pinch of salt george and then just a bit of good extra virgin olive oil just to get it started.
so just get it going and then obviously what you doing is make it into a nice paste.
so you can add a little bit more oil it 's probably going to be about half a cup of oil to three quarters of a cup by the time you finish, we want this to be a little bit lighter for this dish.
so just a splash of water and that will lighten it up and make it nice and smooth good younger right is n't it how easy is that.
so there 's the homas beautiful, easy to make and if you buy one of these little babies just put a lid on and check it in the fridge.
