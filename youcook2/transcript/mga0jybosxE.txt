are you looking for the most luxurious most delicious mashed potato recipe?
ever we 've come to the right place.
if you have i have a pretty fantastic recipe to share with you.
very simple, very delicious.
the first thing that you want to do is to peel and cut up into two inch pieces, two and a half pounds of uconn gold potatoes.
the great thing about uconn gold potatoes is there.
texture is fantastic.
and then make a really nice fluffy but slightly dense mashed potato.
and they have a gorgeous golden color that 's very appetizing to look at when you 're eating uncle to go ahead and use any redskin door.
white skin potato for this do n't go for the baking potatoes.
they 'll be too gummy.
cut the potatoes into two inch pieces.
approximately obviously it does n't need to be exact here because well, you 're going to kocaman.
you just want them smaller.
so they cook faster.
an even so, they cook evenly then put them in a pot and then cover them with water by about two inches.
just make sure they 're fully covered put them on the stove.
add some salt, bring it to a boil and cook it until the potatoes are really nice, and tender about fifteen minutes.
i have a cup and a half of cream here.
i 'm just going to heat it on the back of the stove while the potatoes are cooking.
so it 's nice and warm and does n't cool down the potatoes when we add them.
i like to check to see if the potatoes are done by just mashing them against the side of the pot and making sure they matched.
because when you 're making mashed potatoes, you need them to be completely falling apart.
not waterlogged but mushy.
so once there in which she drain them.
and then what i like to do is put them back in the pot to dry out a little bit.
so make sure you get ouf water as possible so the dryer they are the fluffier.
they 're going to be from here.
you can do one of three things, you can use a food mill.
so really, useful tool, if you make tomato sauce a lot of the time or pureed soups you can use a food mill.
another great tool is a reiser.
this is actually my favorite tool to use because you press your potatoes straight through here and the potatoes come out.
the other side really, really nice and fine and then your standard potato measure that 's going to give you a lumpy or texture a little bit more homemade feeling as opposed to that super high end potato today, i 'm going to use the rice.
so what you want to do is to take your potatoes once they 're drained.
scoop them into your rice are over the pot.
so nothing falls out and you can see that as they are cooling all the liquid, is evaporating there really, really fluffy.
you see, those little white things on top.
that , that means that their fluffy press them through the reiser right into the pot look at that.
so fun it 's like using one of those play doh machines.
this is already nice and fine.
you can just stir your butter.
one stick of butter make sure it 's room temperature so it melts really easily.
i 'm going to break it into little pieces anyway.
it pays to work quickly here.
otherwise , if your potatoes get cool your butter will not melt.
so just stir your potatoes until the butter melts, and then you can add your warm cream.
and in fact, you can start adding it now, even before the butter is completely melted and the warmth of the cream will help melt the rest of the butter.
i 'm just going to start with one cup.
really fine sort of restaurant style mashed potato here almost like a puree.
so if you were interested in doing this and you really wanted extra, extra, fine, after you add your cream you could pass it yet.
one more time through a sieve so that it 's super duper, silky and fine.
i am going to forego, that step because i think there 's super find enough having passed them through my reiser.
let me taste it.
i think it 's probably need salt, and i have to say the texture of this is good.
and i do n't think that needs any more cream.
and i only used about a cup.
so , do n't just go adding all the cream at once?
sure , you add a little bit and then add more if you feel like you need it does n't make a lot, but it 's super rich.
so everybody can do with just one or two little dollops, and if they go in for seconds, remind them that there was a cup and a half.
pre minute spoon up these luxurious mashed potatoes at your next party thanksgiving for instance, and watch everyone 's so cozy, but fancy at the same time.
