but you can use any meats seafood an or vegetables you have made available.
so you might be wondering why is the fried rice yellow.
well , i 'll explain that later on in this video and the reason behind it before i go on.
i want to clarify that this fire eyes is not authentic fire eyes that you will see in asian countries.
in fact, you will not find it anywhere except in america, this video is only a demonstration on what, and how the restaurant makes it started shouting and aborad in one teaspoon of sugar, one teaspoon of salt, one half teaspoon of chicken powder.
one six teaspoon of white pepper and mix ingredients together normally mono sodium glutamate is uses of chicken powder but chicken powder, gives the rice more flavor.
hence , the reason behind using it now let 's prepare the rice.
two cups or four hundred grams of long grain, rice, wash and rinse a couple of times to remove any impurities and talc powder if any.
let 's cook the rice, make sure to use a thick bottom part when cooking on the stove top at in six hundred milliliters or two point, five four cups of water, added in the seasoning mixture two tablespoons of oil and one fourth teaspoon of yellow egg shade this is completely optional store, an cover with lid bring to a boil, then lower the heat to the lowest setting cook for about fifteen to twenty minutes or until all the water are absorbed by the rice, then turn off the heat and let us theme for about ten to fifteen minutes with the lid on.
do not open the lid?
so what 's the purpose of the yellow egg shape or around the nineteen eighties at a mercury restaurant, used four and cheap quality long grain rice, to cook white rice and steamed the rice turn into somewhat light brown in color on some parts of the rice.
this of all white color, which resulted in uneven color, an unpleasant to the eyes.
thus they use the food color use a fork to fluff the rice to a large pan for cooling.
if you want the yellow color of the rice without using any blue color use either turmeric or saffron as a replacement, or you do n't have to use any L.
let the rice cool down to room temperature.
once cool to room temperature, refrigerate the rice for next day use.
let 's combine the ingredients to make pork fries.
you need onion dice, roast pork or trust.

also make roast pork specifically used for the fries, two hundred grams or seven ounce of colt cook flavored rice now.
let 's make the fire eyes.
he walked to spoken hot to prevent it from sticking and in two tablespoons of oil, and dice onions, sauteed onions, just before they are translucent and then the roast pork or the child support for any ingredients you have been available since the pork is already precooked.
just salted for about minute were until it 's warm.
next add into fried rise and cook over medium high heat until the rice is hot make sure to continuously move the fry rice around to ensure even cooking.
i do n't want to two tablespoon, or once berg of green onions, green part, only two tablespoons water during the cooking process the fried rice withdrawal pence the water is added to moisten device.
no additional seasoning is required as this rice is already flavored which makes this fire eyes easy to make ankh assistant in taste, every time you make it now.
it 's time to play, as i mentioned before the food coloring is not necessary ingredient to add in.
so leave it out by all means.
so why ca n't they use good quality rice that well, the answer is simple profit one thing, you have to remember is that their main customer base was lower income people, which means people who have little disposable income.
so higher quality rises which means higher price was out of the question, of course, this restaurant use this method, most of them still stick to the brown fried rice, which is much preferred fried rice.
so it 's up to each individual restaurant, also, if you like you can substitute chicken stock for chicken powder.
