hi guys, and welcome to cooking with comma.
now if you love a good spring roll.
but you do n't like the fat associated with deep frying them well this is a recipe for you today.
i 'm going to show you how to make them in the oven.
they come out just as stacy just as crunchy, so really hope you like them, let 's get started.
and i 'll show you how to make them first.
off , we need to great a carrot and zucchini.
finally , chop up some spring onions and finally, shred some cabbage taking, are fine?
rice noodles in a bowl.
we 're going to break them up into small pieces next we 're going to cover all shit talking mushrooms with some boiling water.
and cover al rice noodles as well, then we 're going to set them to one side for about five to seven minutes, then all we need to do is drain the water from both and chop up.
now she talking mushrooms.
next into a pan on medium heat, we 're going to add in some sesame E oil.
some garlic, and all about shredded vegetables give them all a good mixed together and then we 're going to keep them on the heat for about five to seven minutes until all of those vegetables have softened.
next we 're going to add in the mushrooms and the rice noodles and give it a good splash with some soy sauce, then mix together until everything is well combined and keep it on the heat for another one to two minutes.
now this is completely optional.
but i 'm adding in a little touch of oyster source, mixing that through.
and then we 're done.
then we 're going to pop out mixture to one side to cool completely next.
we 're going to take some water and some corn flour and mix them together, then taking our spring roll papers were going to go around the edges without corn flour mixture, then taking about a quarter of a cup of mixture we 're going to place it into one corner.
then all we need to do is roll over that corner and tuck it in roll.
it up to about halfway fold in each side and then simply roll it up to the end and repeat until their old done now, taking a tray that 's been lined with some baking paper will spray the bottom of the baking paper, with some oil and then the top of L spring rolls, then into the oven for about twenty to twenty five minutes turning halfway through until they golden brown a really easy and cheap meal to make extremely tasty and lovely and crunchy.
but a lot less fat than if you date fried them.
