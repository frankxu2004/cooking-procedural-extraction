hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with irish shepherds pie.
because we 're using irish cheddar, we 're using the authentic lamb and when it 's gone, you 're going to save yourself irish.
i had more all right to get started.
we 're going to put a little bit of olive oil and butter in a dutch oven on medium heat going to throw in a diced onion and lamb a couple pounds of ground lamb shepherds.
pie is made with lamb, not beef shepherds raise sheep, not cows.
so when you make a shepherds pie with beef, you call it a kottage pie.
that makes no sense, alright.
and you want to take a wooden spoon.
and while that cooks, you want to break it up.
nice and small.
there should be a lot of liquid that comes out lot of water do n't worry.
that 's going to evaporate and eventually you 'll start hearing it , sizzle.
and it will start to brown a nicely, ideally.
it leaves you a nice brown fonde on the bottom of the pan, all right, when it gets to that point, which took me about ten minutes or so.
i 'm gonna add, a nice big spoon of flower that 's going to make that beautiful thick gravy that holds all this together, and we 're going to cook that flower for just about three or four minutes.
and while we 're cooking the raw edge off that flower their seasoning we 're going to go with salt and pepper.
so fresh rosemary, a little bit of pep rica, a little touch of cinnamon, some ketchup, which i hear people in europe, love and some fresh minced garlic.
we 're going to stir that in and i know some.
that 's not classic, classic shepherds pie, but, you know, what the irish are very experimental people, and i think they would have proved.
so by the time we added our seasoning and stir it in the flowers been cooking long enough.
and we 're going to add are liquid.
i 'm adding water in broth, you can add beef broth.
lamb is a pretty strongly flavored meat, so really does n't add a whole heck of a lot alright.
we 're going to give it a stir.
it 's going to thicken up very quickly.
because we used a good amount of flour and we 're just going to cook this for about five or six minutes until it really thickens up nice, i mean, really thick, it should look something like that at that point, you can turn off the heat and it 's time to add the vegetables which are peas and carrots.
now since we 're using frozen peas, i 'm going to be nice and let you use frozen carrots.
did the frozen peas in the same bag as soon as the vegetables are stirred in, we 're going to transfer this into your casserole dish and he can add large baking dish will work?
i believe this is nine by thirteen.
you 're going to spread it out.
and you 're going to tap it down.
not the old tappa, tappa, we 're going to use the spatula just smooth it out.
so that 's all set, we 're going to set that aside until our potato.
crust is ready which is made from potatoes, the most irish of all ingredients by the way indigenous to america, you 're welcome, ireland.
i think you 've more than made up for it by sending us all those policemen, boil a couple pounds of potatoes.
i 'm using uconn gold.
i think they make a beautiful cross nice color nice texture.
so we 're going to boil those in salted water until tender going to drain them thoroughly tossing some butter.
some cayenne, some salt, of course some cream cheese and some irish cheddar.
i want to go to one of the big supermarkets and try to find irish cheddar.
it 's really, really good.
i 'm easy one called dubliner, which is not that hard to find.
if you ca n't find irish cheddar any kind of sharp white cheddar will work going to take a potato masher in mesh, all that together, and when that thoroughly incorporated, i 'm going to also add one egg.
yolk , then i 'm going to beat with a couple tablespoons of milk going to pour that in stirred in when that 's all mixed in go ahead and top your meat.
but here 's how you 're going to want to do it, place big spoonfuls on top.
do n't just dump it on top.
because you do n't want to mix the filling, the meat mixture into the crust.
so i 'd like to put dollops all over the top?
then take a fork and even it all out.
now there 's lots of ways, you can do this really rough, and rugged very similar to the terrain of the irish shepherd, or you can take a fork and make one of these kind of crosshatch designs.
i think that looks pretty cool, or if you 're insane like me, you can spend fifteen minutes mimicking the pattern on the wool sweaters worn by the shepherds.
once the toppings done, we 're going to put that in a three hundred and seventy five degree oven four about twenty.
five thirty minutes what you 're looking for, is this a beautiful crust?
you 're going to see that gravy bubbling around the outside.
something like this you.
gotta let sit at least fifteen minutes, but, you know, what i did n't wait i 'm going to admit it right now the sun was going down.
and i wanted to get the final money shots.
so i just said, i 'm going in with the spatula, but, you know, what it worked everything was fine.
in fact, more than fine, just amazing there 's nothing better than a well made shepherds pie that slightly gamey yet beautifully flavored lamb the vegetables that thick rich gravy and then the irish cheddar in the potatoes on the top perfect would be a great change of pace of that corn beef and cabbage for saint patrick 's day or have both even better.
so there you go irish shepherds pie.
i hope you give this a try head over to food wishes, dot com for all the ingredient amounts and more information is usual, and as always enjoy.
