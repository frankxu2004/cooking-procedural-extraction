hey dudes, i 'm hilah anne, today on hilah cooking.
i 'm going to show you how to make baked turkey meatballs.
these are like the trifecta of perfectness.
they are delicious.
they are fast in their healthy, so let 's get started.
and then will be done in a flash, and you 'll get to make 'em.
all right, i 've got a pound of lean ground turkey here.
so this is turkey breast.
make sure if you want to keep these low fat or whatever to get turkey breast 'cause sometimes it 'll be like dark turkey meat.
and then that often has just as much fat as beef would so anyway.
whatever OK, this is some oatmeal.
and i 'm just sort of crumbling up with my hands.
you can use bread crumbs or matzo meal crumbs or anything like that, just something kind of dry.
that 's going to like is orb that moisture from the egg, the egg moisture and some parsley and garlic and these are like, these are pretty garlicky the turkey is.
so mild garlic really sticks, sticks out and then also.
because we 're baking these instead of frying them garlic, stays a little sharper, which i really like especially with sort of italian food.
you can use these mixed in after their baked mixed in with some warm tomato sauce and served over spaghetti favorite things to do with these is, while they 're still warm, wrapped them up in some napa cabbage leaves, or some big lettuce leaves with like, like it 's a heaney sauce and some radishes and cucumbers and stuff like that, and almost, almost make like a, i do n't know like it 's healthy it 's a rap.
let 's a rap, you know, what i mean yeah, you can do lots with them and they 're even good cold the.
next day, so one of become like one of my go to recipes.
now then i 've got some grated carrot, and i graded this on a microplane.
so it 's like super finely grated i 've also done this recipe using grated sweet potato i like the fine whole greater, just 'cause it gives the finish meatballs and more delicate texture.
but you could probably use the regular cheese grater.
probably , probably i 've never tried it, salts.
and sometimes i 'll also add a couple tablespoons of parmesan cheese to the same mixture.
if i 'm doing like a nick cerrone from pepperell, it guys.
i finally got a pepper grinder.
so i do n't have to like grind it by hand like the paleolithic era or something or she proud of me OK.
so , once this is mixed up, well, i 've got a baking sheet here.
but i 'm just lined with some parchment paper, and i 'm going to use my little cookie scoop just to portion it out.
you could roll it by hand.
but this is way faster an like really in the grand scheme of things who wants to spend time making sure that their meatballs are perfectly round.
i do n't you might need to like.
put them close together depending on how big your cookie sheet is 'cause you 'll get probably twenty four meatballs out of this mixture, OK, awesome that last one is little shrimpy.
but now i 'm just going to put these in the oven at three fifty for about twenty minutes until they 're nice and firm and they 'll be a little bit golden brown.
OK , so twenty minutes later it 's given me just enough time to cook some spaghetti and heat up some just plain.
tomato sauce marinara sauce.
so they 're done their set, so i can go ahead and clock on my bowl here.
