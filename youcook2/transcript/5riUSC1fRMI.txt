update , Z, what 's going on guys assignment.
welcome back to the dire kitchen.
i am back with my good friends at nasa food to bring another delicious recipe, and it 's a favorite of.
i 'm hoping many of you 'cause.
there 's a big favorite of mine.
it is of course, it grilled cheese sandwich.
i am going to be taking you through my personal ultimate way to make this the best possible grilled cheese sandwich.
so , yeah, just remember if you did like the video click that, like by and at the end and subscribe if you have n't already.
because i have loads and loads of recipes alot probably in the hundreds without further ado list on a recipe first thing is of course, the bread now.
this recipe is completely adaptable to how you want to customize it for your macros.
this would be the lowest calorie option possible that i 'm making today.
so i 'm using low carb, breads about ten grams of carbs per slice of twenty grams in total and what you want to do is the first thing you want to do.
this is optional.
as , well, guys if you do n't like mustard completely, leave it out, take some taking english mustard here and just spread a thin on one slice of bread.
so , if you do n't like mustard guys, you can use any kind of chutney you like AT and caramelize onion.
chutney or something like that will go amazingly with this, but just more macros obviously mustard is pretty much.
calorie free, yeah, damn right.
and we 're going to go with next is the cheese.
so today i 'm going with the new muscle food zero fat cheese.
yeah , is the macros are amazing per hundred grams?
you 've got a hundred and seventy seven calories two point two grams of fat point seven grams of carbs and twenty eight grams of protein.
so damn, damn good.
they 've got mozzarella and the cheddar, and we 're going to go with a mix of both today.
there will be an offer to go along with this video limited time only to check that out in the description box below guys like i said completely adaptable.
if you ca n't find these kind of cheeses then use a lower fat cheese or a full fat cheese use.
if you like absolutely anything, so what we 're going to take.
i have thirty grams.
the bread, you might need to use more cheese for a different type of bread that grams of each sixty grams in total in here to this.
we 're going to add in a pinch of oregon are just that much going to add in an eighth of a teaspoon of smoked paprika.
some freshly ground black pepper in there, too, and then just give that a little stir together.
i would definitely recommend going with two types of cheese and matter what it just gives more dimension and depth to the flavor and.
let 's add this onto one slice of bread as you can see packed full of cheese.
so amazing as you know, that stuff going to melt out everywhere and be delicious and then we 're going to take the other slice of bread and this is another key to an amazing grilled cheese is take a bit of butter i 'm going for the low calorie kind.
today , of course.
but use whatever kind of like fire is full of micronutrients guys a lot of calcium in there as well.
so do n't be afraid to use butter you can brush on some olive oil if you like it 's completely up to you and just spread that really fairly you do n't want to go on that and this is actually going to be pretty outside of the grilled cheese sandwich, perfect, and then.
let 's move over to our pan area.
so this is a dry pan.
is nothing in it at all?
we 're going to put it onto a low heat, so, like that, much, you want to quite like you want to cook it low and slow and.
let 's wait for that to heat up OK, that 's nice and hot and, we 're going to place it butter side down.
so the side that we butted earlier, just pushed out down in japan at little bit as part of the other side a little bit now.
now we 're going to place a lid on top.
so it helps steam and melt the cheese without burning the bread and we 're going to leave that for about a minute and then we 'll check under the other side to see how it 's toasted.
so it 's ready to flip, look at.
that , that is amazing.
a little press down on this side, and it was another minute on the other side, and then we 're done all right.
i 've just checked underneath and it 's done.
so , let 's head over to R chopping board ansi that melted goodness wireless cut in the middle.
yeah , he 's in our nicely right is perfect.
cool , i 'm going to get stuck in you can see like the little mustard as well beautiful alright.
i 'm going to start going guys.
video showed macros, and i 'll take that taste as well.
here is the beauty itself, i ca n't wait to try it.
so good, so nice those flavors.
just they just work all of them work perfectly together awesome.
chutney in there as well.
anything you want like guys the butter on the outside makes the bread so crispy, but yet just in front of it the bread stays release.
often just called that gooey melted cheese and other cheeses like the best way in the world.
i really hope you try this recipe guys and let me know what you think.
