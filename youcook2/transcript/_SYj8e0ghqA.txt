how about some pork fried rice tonight everybody i was getting kind of hungry.
and his pork chop it 's been thought at my refrigerator for a few days.
it 's been a zip lock bag.
so what i did was i just cut it up.
i 've been having internet bowl marinating in some, uh, soy sauce and some black pepper.
but a half an hour got a better like i said, you guys left my videos.
it might be three quarter cup of frozen peas and carrots.
but i have a an onion white onion.
green onions will be good, would n't it?
i do n't have any here 's about two day.
oh , ross is been frigerator, so i thought i better use it for something.
i can let it go.
spoil , whatever i want to use one egg lots.
i 've seen lots of people use two three sometimes three eggs.
there 's a lot of eggs anyway.
i got some old heating up right there and i look in there, got me a walk that 's right.
think it might be coming up probably in a couple tablespoons.
let 's get her pork.
but in there, yeah, i thought this guy printed day on my and put it down keep that for cooked up coming back on the heat back up to that medium.
i do n't know if your electric, so that more about in between six and seven alright.
so since you sitting here watching it cook will be back alright, so are pork is finished.
it 's been cooking, for about five or six minutes against on pretty high heat, so it 's finished.
i will pull it out.
i see it might be easier to do likely.
it places to the side now right here.
i see a lot of people say clean your walk.
take out your whop it down, whatever.
why there 's no bacteria in there.
it 's like that, turn the heat back up.
but those onions cook for a minute or two, been a couple of minutes.
the onions are certain, gets a little bit brown.
but steel real, crispy and in your frozen vegetables, cook them with the onions there that DM guys get to know each other, pretty good, well, those are starting to look a little bit.
hail heavy selling beer, hey, you know, since you guys sitting watching somebody cook pork fried rice for twenty minutes i do n't know why, it lately.
i 've just been getting on my nerves.
i do n't like long videos, keep them short people pay.
attention people short, that 's why i 'm keeping this would show it two minutes, two minutes.
i see it.
could you crap out of the way form over in the same plate with your pork, open their wrist, do n't walk?
you walk out.
leave it alone.
add a little bit more.
all i had your ice in this case days, old rice not just worn is n't two three day old rice.
it 's already been seasoned with salt and pepper when i cooked it.
but right now i work with them garlic powder in it.
you do n't like garlic powder, do n't put it in there?
it 's alright, but what you like in it.
sure boo, if you watch a video with somebody that 's something that you do n't like do n't do it ai n't no big deal.
all right now while that rifle we 're getting heated up, it 's a good time to add some sugar, not a whole lot, OK, good healthy pinch of sugar first main that makes it good steak in there.
you do n't want sugar, do n't add it?
i tell you make supply dries pretty damn good alright.
take it away.
all right there add a little right in center of it, is like that, it 'll rig crack it proper in there, just like that, that guy scrambled up.
make sure you got to see what i 'm doing.
yeah , you can see zoom in any you have to work how far off there you go.
how about that, skip the eggs scrambled up.
yeah , maybe you 're bored at now.
i do n't care.
but then he cook for a minute or two or less start, getting at ross involved without eggs.
that 's right, as always.
i guarantee either better way to do this, but this is my way.
let 's get our meat in our veggies that guys.
