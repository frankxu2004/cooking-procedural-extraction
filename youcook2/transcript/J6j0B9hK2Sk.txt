i heart recipes dot com, so, let 's get started.
i have my shrimp here.
this is cook shrimp that i got for my deli.
remove the shells from details.
and i 'll also be using my crappy this actually imitation crab, but if you want to use real crabmeat you certainly can, i chopped it up.
but i left it nice and chunky and over hear myself talk, i 'm going to start boiling my macaroni.
i 'm going to boil, it in lightly salted water, and i 'm using large elbow.
but you could use shells or small macaroni.
if you choose while my pasta is boiling by the way, i 'm going to boil until it 's nice and all dente, i 'm going to chop up some celery green onion.
you can use yellow onion if you choose, and i 'm going to use the green and white parts i sent it to the side.
and i 'm going to make my dressing.
i 'm going to use some best foods.
mayonnaise AKA helmets as well as yellow mustard and this is similar to my potato salad dressing, but we 're going to use different spices and stuff.
i just poured in some lemon juice that is necessary and now we 're going to mix everything until well, combined.
so now we 're going to spice this up with some cajun seasoning favorite occasion seasons.
i 'm using tony chatteris.
i think that 's how you say it always.
i always say it wrong.
but i 'm also going to use some old bay spice.
and , once that is, in there.
let 's put or start sprinkling in some freshly crackled black pepper and now, we 're going to mix this, and says well, combined.
i almost forgot.
i 'm going to add in cement garlic as well.
so at that, in there and now, we 're going to load this baby up with lots of shrimp and crab.
i 'd like to leave my crab.
nice and chunky, the folded in until everything is nicely coated with my dressing.
i 'm now going to start adding in my onions and celery.
and i 'm also going to be using or adding in some black olives and my hours are sliced up.
but some people like to leave them whole you can do that if you choose.
course , i suggest you make sure they 're pitted once the noodles.
or my pasta is all done, i 'm going to let it cool down.
of course, i drained it.
and now i 'm rinsing it under cool water to stop the cooking process, and now i 'm going to start adding my pasa into the bowl.
just make sure the pasta is called before you added with the other ingredients.
so fold saying make sure is well combined.
and i 'm going to add some parsley flakes to add.
color , that is completely optional and once i 'm done, mixing everything.
i 'm going to refrigerate this until it 's nice and cold.
and once it is nice and cold.
i 'm just going to remove it out of the refrigerator, place it in my serving bowl, and i am good to go this is perfect for your upcoming barbecues.
