lenore will bees with me today, and she just got married pregnant, or you got married before they got married, over year ago.
so how are you feeling.
i feel great good and what are you saying what are you feeding your husband.
these days take out really which is why i 'm here to learn how to make something turkey meatballs, and spaghetti anna, nice, nice tomato sauce with debbie nice delicious, and you can eat almost anything right.
now right, and a lot of a lot of it, and this is one of those meals that everyone can enjoy kids adults, pregnant women.
so delicious so lenore starting this sausan you have about how much oil in their three tablespoons, three tablespoons of olive oil in four cloves of garlic and refine leemans that after that 's cooked your add five cups of crushed red tomatoes and these are the strain variety 'cause you do n't you do n't want any seeds in the sauce and we 're going to add dried oregano about a quarter, or half a teaspoon turns on how much you like there if you have fresh oregano, you could use that and also a quarter teaspoon of thyme, leaves some pepper freshly ground black pepper and some coarse salt.
now do use kosher salt at home.
i do n't think so whatever is in the little shaker.
oh , really allowed it to get into the little shaker.
did anybody put it there?
yes , larry, oh, he did.
OK , well, you can admit that larry is more of the cook.
then how long do this, this could come just simmer it away until the cover on it looks like that, so, yeah, you bring it to a simmer and you 're going to cook it for covered thirty minutes while i make the meatball mixture.
do you want a great some cheese?
and you can just create it right onto the board here.
and we 're going to put in the bowl for the meatballs.
one large egg we 're going to make the sort of egg mixture first.
and some milk authorative a cup of whole milk, we can just missed this together.
we have one white onion that 's been peeled and finely misses a large white onion and you can add that to the mix and bread, crumbs and the bird comes to get nice and softap in the milk, and we have two thirds of a cup of plain white bread crumbs and a half.
a cup of parmesan cheese, which is a very nice addition to turkey, which is a bland meat, but it 's a low fat meat.
and people really like that you can put that parmesan that 's going to be further pasta right in here if you like.
and we have wonderful fresh turkey meat and it is one pound of ground turkey, you can use dark meat of turkey or white meat of turkey.
but this looks like the dark meat of turkey you really have to season turkey.
right , yeah, that 's why we 're adding fresh pepper lot of parmesan cheese and could you just dump in the parsley and a half.
a cup of finally chopped fresh flat leaf parsley.
and if you do n't have flatly if you can use curly people are always asking, why do you ask for the flat leaf i think the flight leave has a nicer taste?
but , you know, that from around here right i do right so here.
i used to mix this by hand, when i would help my mother.
but here i 'm going to give you some put your hands in the cold water.
OK , now i 'm going to put this in your hand now just roll it into a little ball.
how do you know, how big to make them while making it this big scoop?
i 've never seen right here put him here.
OK , that 's a good idea.
that 's a good thing saying they do n't stick to your hands.
they 're very late hope.
you feel how white.
they are people say, oh well, you work a martha stewart.
you must know how to cook really.
well , i said, that 's not my area.
i do crafts and out another nice thing about these meatballs if you notice we did n't brown lemon oil where we did n't put the bread crumbs on the outside we put them on the inside.
you will go right into the pot and then anytime that you use raw meat.
you have to always wash your hands well in hot water and proceed with the rest of the recipe, or you can wash your hands.
i think cooking techniques are a lot of fun to teach, you can turn the water off looks like lynyrd spends a lot of time in the kitchen.
i can very easily distracted that 's my biggest problem.
OK , well, i 'm dropping these very gently into that beautifully simmering sauce to take this home tonight, and i do n't know.
yes , bring the sauce to a simmer and cook the meatballs for eight to twelve minutes.
look how great these look those go in the spaghetti, well, they can go in, or you can serve them on top and.
