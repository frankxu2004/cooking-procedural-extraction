all right, we 're going to start by adding some butter into a large skillet.
let that melt.
and then we 're going to throw in our onions now, sometimes.
i even add in some celery and some green peppers.
that 's really good.
but today we gotta, keep it simple.
and just throwing those onions and next we 're going to add in some garlic alright, just let that cook for a bit.
and now just pour all of that into a bowl a large bowl butter, and all going to leave that button.
now do n't bring that butter alright.
so now you 're going to add in your lean ground beef at that, right in there with the onions and stir it up a little bit.
and i have some slightly being eggs.
go ahead and pour that in and next we 're going to add in our spices that you want to print this recipe out.
and you want all the measurements and all that kind of stuff.

i have tips and all that good stuff.
so , we add it in our spices and now it 's time to add that barbeque sauce.
i 'm using sweet baby rays.
i love that sauce.
but you can use whatever kind you want, and they also add in some of that chili sauce and some worcester shire sauce the milk, keep it nice and moist and.

or you can work gloves whatever i like to touch my meatloaf.
i have to it 's just not natural not soon.
so you go ahead and get that nice and mixed in bam just like that perfect right.
now i 'm going to use that pan that i cook my onions in.
i 'm going to like a little test patty just to make sure that the seasonings are on point that is flavorful and that i like and if you do n't like it go ahead and add in more spices or whatever.
but i thought it was perfect.
so it is ready to go.
i 'm going to go ahead and take that meat and just add it to my loaf pan palette on in there and using my rubber.
spatula to kind of press it down to get out any air pockets and.
now i 'm going to make a simple, little false to go on top just some catch up and chili sauce.
i mixed together and next i 'm going to use some char grilled barbecue sauce.
if you ca n't find char grilled barbecue sauce, then you can just add in some hickory smoke to your regular barbecue sauce or some liquid smoke, and it gives it kind of like a grill charcoal type flavored too.
it 's really good right.
so go ahead and spread that onto the top of your meatloaf, OK, i use half that mixture read that on just like this beautiful, beautiful OK.
now my oven is already preheated to three fifty, i 'm going to pop this in the oven for about thirty minutes, and after thirty minutes, i 'm going to pull it out and put the rest of that sauce on there OK and then let that cook for about another thirty minutes or until it 's done all right.
and it will come out looking like this beautiful thing.
i sprinkled it with some green onion flakes, you can use parsley or just leave it playing.
do n't really matter?
and now after it has set for awhile you want to slice it up and big old thick slices is how we like it in my family.
nice thick slices and this meatloaf is so juicy but yet firm is full of flavor.
