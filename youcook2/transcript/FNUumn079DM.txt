great make caesar dressing the croutons to rose that she came to make everything look absolutely gorgeous.
so let 's start first of all, we have two rows, the ticket to cook the chicken.
i have a pun here.
i will start preheating my band.
we need to give a nice golden color singing and i need through gloves, put them on.
i need the one bold some olive oil pepper salt two cloves of garlic and a chicken just make sure this is money is going everywhere in my pants should be HAWT by now.
so i will add the chicken ever.
garlic and the only thing that i want now is to give a nice golden color to the ticket.
i have one loaf pan here, and i will stack it with lots of heads.
i have some time here.
some oregano and i will make a little bed for mighty, king look at this, this is the best way to cook chicken in the oven.
now my chicken should be ready from one side, flip them over given nice golden color from the other side, and it 's impossible to cook the chicken to the panel will have to put it in the oven, i already preheated my open to one hundred eighty degrees cells.
you set to fun.
i will add one tablespoon of butter.
let it caramelize with butter and put this lovely chicken over the herbs.
look at this.
now take all this butter and put it over the chicken and garlic put the loaf pan inside the oven and cook normally normal size of chicken, needs fifteen minutes.
but this at least twenty.
but it 's enough time to prepare our dressing.
this is addressing.
i need a tiny food processor.
i will add just one clove of garlic some olive oil.
their answer is this is the secret ingredient inside this recipe, now pick them come.
kill the garlic completely dissolve.
now any the ball in the juice and desist from one lemon normally this is n't set up there is no zest arm adding some cyst to give something more.
this is alan and if the lemon is very true, she do n't could a whole lemon.
would half of it i will add some more?
that should be enough.
and the last equation my onus, you need to buy a good quality.
magnus put in my engine.
this makes it empty.
it stays time perfection.
so caesar dressing goes into the fridge and we carry on with the croutons.
i need one more pound.
and we are making one hundred percent homemade caesar salad.
so we have to make our homemade croutons, nonstick pan, am at some good quality butter to your ball?
at least two tablespoons for that amount of bread now cut your bread into good cubes and do n't try to make your homemade croutons.
so i will add some other gamma tool salt and pepper, we almost done.
the sources in the fridge, the chicken is in the oven, the croutons are about to be ready.
when the croutons are done set them aside until the chicken is cooked so probably in ten minutes.
we 're making our salad so everything is ready to prepare our salad.
the chicken is rose to perfection.
homemade andrew, stick the perfect dressing for caesar salad, i have some mice back.
here parsley and parmesan let 's combine everything together.
first , the letters i prefer using iceberg becaus iceberg does not become, so give when we had them ionis.
no cut it too big tongues slice them like this big tanks, and inside the board ranchi and nice i 've made more dressing than necessary.
but you can store it into the fridge, at least for one month.
there is no problem.
add all the letters inside, and now it 's time for mister.
parsley translate is not necessary for the recipe.
but giving nice color and nice taste not allowed parsley inside, and for this amount of salad i need about three tablespoons of caesar dressing mix, mix here.
do not add more dressing than required just to quote the letters be cause if we had a lot of dressing the salad is not nice?
so now it 's time for mister chicken now.
some parmesan flakes that should be enough, makes a little bit everything give some color to your salad, with some parsley and class at the croutons who can resist in this piece of art.
