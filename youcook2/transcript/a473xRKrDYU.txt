hey , everybody welcome to the wolf there, today, i 'm going to show you how to make original buffalo wings, and we 're going to grill him instead of crime.
if you like him, fried you 're going to love him grill so let 's get started original.
buffalo wings do n't have any seasoning.
so i 'm starting with three pounds of naked wings that i 've cut in half.
and remove the.
tips , i have the grill do n't preheated to three hundred fifty degrees and the wings are going to grow over direct heat for about fifteen to twenty minutes, flipping about every five minutes.
and now for the original buffalo sauce, i 'm going to start with butter, granulated garlic worcester shire sauce apple cider vinegar, the original recipe has white vinegar in it.
but i think apple cider vinegar has much better taste to it at last.
but not least franks red hot for a full printable copy of this recipe and many more visit the wolfpit blog, and here we are after the first five minutes, we 're going to go ahead and flipper wings.
the smell and flavor you get from cooking these wings over direct heat with that fat, dripping right down on the kohl 's is amazing.
that 's a lot of additional flavor.
now , as a sauce comes up to temperature, it absorb that nice smokey flavor.
now , after a total of fifteen minutes and a couple more flips or chicken wings are about ready to be sauced.
i 'm going to heavily sauce each wing and then put it back on the grill for five.
more minutes continue this process until all the wings are coded for an extra layer of flavor.
i did the wings into the buffalo sauce.
one more time, and after a total of twenty five minutes or wings are done.
and there you have it a beautiful plate of smoky grilled buffalo wings with blue cheese carrots and celery.
these turned out to be the best buffalo wings i 've ever had or made and as you could tell my daughter, and i tore through these like animals.
thank you guys very much for watching.
i hope you give these a try and i 'll see you next time.
