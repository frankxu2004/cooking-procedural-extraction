it 's a british classic or irish, depending on which one you talked they, all claim it.
we 're cooking with practically everything.
you already have at home.
the other thing you should have to go out and buy his ground lamb other than that you have all the stuff, you could use ground beef if you want.
but that would be a college by same thing just a little bit different flavor.
so we cook with today.
we got our potatoes.
you got one and a half carats.
a fourth cup of peas half an onion, two to three cloves of garlic, a fourth cup of flour ground, lamb.
we got some pepper.
we have a port wine.
some catch up.
we 're just going to throw in their mix of rosemary thyme and bay leaf.
i think it 's actually pronounced, i 'm cody know, it 's time.
there 's a TH at the beginning, but in time will agree to disagree alright are chicken.
stock , two egg yolks are parmesan cheese and just a salt pepper mix.
so we 're going to do first is we 're going to peel their potatoes.
an are carrots.
now if you want to start with people in our potatoes were, going to do is just kind of peel them and to leave out one fourth of the skin on them.
you want to leave a fourth of the skin on there.
yeah , you want me to cut it in four pieces and just not peel one of them.
no , no, just, just peel it and leave about a fourth of the skin on their part.
istic said that are n't very good.
potatoes , and while he does that i 'm going to peel some of our carrots that a quarter a little more looks good when we 're done feeling these taylor i 'm going to cut the potatoes into force, and i 'm going to great all our vegetables and the reason.
we 're grading our vegetables so they get really machine there.
it almost be like a puree.
you do n't even really know there in there like baby food that 's right, sounds like a pickle.
so when you get really small like this, you know, kind of be careful of your fingers, do n't cut yourself grieving, garlics, the hardest part of it.
so small now there are potatoes are cut up.
now that are meet just about brown.
go ahead and add are peppered.
they stared at around make.
sure it gets season all around.
now we 're going to add it all, or veggies that we cut up, we shredded like that you got a nice color in there now.
how 's it going, you know, it 's cooking.
it 's the exciting part wait for it all to come together.
so what now cody we waited on veggies to get nice and bushy, and we 're just about at that point.
so we 're going to mix in our flower.
we 're going to their real, well, make sure it gets in all the meat baskin be the base for gravy.
now we 're just going to put two kinda heavy shots of ketchup, really makes it in there.
just like we did with their flower going to make sure it 's all nice and mixed in there, so i have the women, one now no limit.
i do n't know where you got no lemon.
where did you get a limb?
the counter we 're not using everything that we 're going to do a heavy shot of a pork loin.
anymore , of that, so after you cook out your wine, you 're going to throw in all your herbs once again.
mix , mix, well, that 's the key to this recipe, just mixing it all in, well, alright, we 're waiting on our potatoes in our meat.
ahead , and separate are egg yolks.
so if you just want to crack it, you know, separating you just crack it and then pass the yolk back and forth and the way to fall out, yeah, there you go good job , job.
my friend i 'm going to check on the meat alright.
all right, so we 're going to hit it with chicken stock, and that 's going to make our gravy.
we 're only going to cook it for about two minutes, 'cause we do n't want to reduce it too much.
it 's already starting to thicken up all right, so we 're just going to put it right in here, and we 're going to spread it out.
nice and evenly OK.
so you have a nice and spread it out spread out yeah, yeah.
so what we 're going to do is have you killed the heat on our potatoes.
an , you know, strain it.
so you go do that now and spread it, spread, it, spread it 's fine.
it 's fine OK, so, now i 'm gonna.
have you take all of our extra leftover ingredients without the except for the egg whites and make them all into this bowl right here.
so i 'll get these egg whites so you do n't forget going to just start throwing them altogether which one should i do first.
probably start with potatoes.
that 's pretty gross.
but so what kind of texture we looking forward this your basic mashed potato.
it 's not going to be as creamy.
because we have the cheese in there in the eggs which are really sticking it together, and we do n't have the milk or the butter.
but basic mashed potato texture screw bar potatoes, right into our piping bag, which you do n't have to do this at home it 's just for it will just be for presentation only you can just spread it on evenly.
but i 'm going to make it look nice fancy.
the fancy, fancy is good.
so just little, little bit will be spread evenly throughout kind of like tetto flower buds, exactly, taylor that 's our final product.
but throw it in the oven for about seventeen minutes.
it 's preheated to three hundred fifty degrees.
he said pie, it 's just not it 's, it 's a meat pie.
it 's OK, it 's fine.
it 's fine trust.
me , that it will be good.
it 's just not what i was expecting would be good OK, alright OK.
all right, that 's what we want with a nice golden brown tips alright, so there 's only one last thing to do, and that 's DJ.
go ahead and let us know how it is.
