hey , i 'm hila welcome back to highly cooking, so this is episode.
one season, three, and it 's pretty awesome that it 's season three already.
and i 'm really excited to be back.
i had a really great summer.
i hope everyone else did too.
i had a lot of hot dogs.
among other things, but this is a really fun way to make hot dogs.
and i started doing, and i thought i 'd be a fun way to start off season three.
so today mexican hot dogs away.
now you may be thinking what the mexican hotdog, hila are you being racist, but let me assure you that i am not mexican.
hot dog is something that was actually originated in the state of sonora in mexico, that 's like just south of california.
so sometimes it 's called a sonoran, hotdog.
and basically what it is there 's a couple of different things so it 's gotta.
have bacon wrapped around it let me see here.
look , bam, they can hotdogs you happen to make and then you got some green salsa and mayonnaise.
those are also essential things people to go.
i like to put that on there.
i like mustard too.
and then these roles these are called bolillo rolls.
are like a mexican french bread roll, roll soft, you can use regular hotdog buns, but these are delish?
an if you want to you could also use like a big soft, like french bread.
and like cut it into chunks and use that, but i got these 'cause i live in te haas.
so i 'm lucky enough to get that stuff.
OK , so i 'm going to show you start with some preparations with some bacons and some hot dogs, OK.
so we 're going to take our bacon pieces and wrapped each hot dog in bacon to make a little spirol.
like , like so just kidding, that 's raw OK.
i 'm going to do that, and then cook him.
OK , so i 'm going to turn my skillet on here.
i got my trusty cast iron as usual, and go ahead and put my little guys in.
and i want to kind of try to get it so that the little like the ends are on the bottom as much as possible metal help.
it stick together a little better as you cook on the bacon is very likely to kind of unroll a little bit that it 'll stay on good enough.
so it will be still be totally yummy, so just relax.
so we 're just going to watch these fry for a little while.
probably ten minutes, or so more rolling around a little bit.
and then will put him on the yummy rolls and unique condiments.
so this is in about seven minutes or so of bacons.
all crispy my hot dogs are all like getting a little burned up on the ends, which i like will not burn.
hot dogs , too.
i cut my bangs on the top that look real cute when i fill it up with stuff.
i 'm just going to kind of can get a little bit toasted and also soak up some bacon grease.
so now it 's time to dress these up, i 'm going to put some mayonnaise and all that stuff on it alright, so, first, we got the mayonnaise, which might seem weird to some people.
but it 's kind of required unless you totally hate mayonnaise.
i guess you could leave it off.
OK , and i guess in the yellow mustard, and this is preferred over like any kind of fancy.
think , you know, whatever just get the yellow mustard.
it 's good for you got to work correct, then hot dog for me hot dog, for me ann, from the screens also, which i put the recipe on the website i just, i mean, it 's really easy to throw some stuff and put in a blender.
you can do it some of the good guy, oh, which i think i 'll also put this on there, which is also just cutting stuff up, and mixing it together.
and sometimes you might put avocado on it, whatever.
and then i also have some pickled, jalapenos.
oh , my god.
this is embarrassing.
exactly , geez, i should 've been working out over the summer also apparently so emily, emily, emily 's mom made these so thanks.
babe alright, throw some of these on there.
and , uh, some little pickled onions, too, yay, alright cat and, get some.

so have some napkins ready.
OK , i 'm going to try that i 'll put it up in the site with all the salsa recipes and stuff.
