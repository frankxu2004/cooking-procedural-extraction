let me tell you because we will be putting butter and this plus will be using heavy whipping cream in this, so this is like a real punjabi dish.
so just wanted to let you guys know that tall mckinney means doll, that is black worth with kidney means that the general thought it does n't go in this recipe show, you recipe, which i have from my childhood.
and this is my mother signature dish, plus whenever you will go to pajama to any java that setup hostile doll i 'm going to present you guys today.
so let me to introduce you to the ingredients.
today hit, does you, you see, i have already soaked this stuff with some kidney beans so, i have used around one cup of doll with the, you can say like half, half, half cup or less than that of kidney beans.
so not much of kidney beans.
but this is the doll which i have already solved from four five hours.
so we 'll be just putting it in pressure, current give like one or two faces, then it would be done, then what else we need, for this is will be putting.
some long that 's gloves close in this with some ginger in this.
so ginger should be in this way, it should be like a string, you can cut with your hands, or you can create it like a strings, then four thirty car, that is for tempering will be needing some jira, that is khuman seeds.
some finally chopped fresh garlic.
some onions, some cilantro, then here is the fury.
i have already put it around four tomatoes for medium sized tomatoes.
fury actually gives a nice texture and color to the doll mcnee.
that 's the reason we 're using puri and here is my butter.
as we needed, some salt, some garam, masala at and some red chili powder with some heavy whipping cream.
so ginger i 'll be using in the pressure cooker.
so let 's start the process.
so whenever you soap doll or anything like kidney beans also use that model only to give, you know, pressure of pressure put the doll use that water.
only do n't take that water out.
so i 'll be using this water, so here goes with all i have already added.
do you often it so you have to use around.
eight , nine clocks in this if you want you can use latterman big cardamom.
you can use that too.
but i am avoiding this is like for daily use.
so if it 's a party time you should use that to it will give a nice flavor.
so here goes the.
it 's around one cup of thought.
i would say and around three cups of water in it and here goes changer.
so you have to use ginger this way only, and some oil in this some people put turmeric in this.
but signature dish of a job does n't have any turmeric in it.
so marky doll, that is, doll mcnee note american.
it so here i 'll let me close the cooker, and i 'll just put it, put it in a high flame, and i 'll put it on a high flame, and then you do n't give it a vessel two or three visitors, then it would have been done in the meanwhile.
i 'll just start making turkey off this task.
here goes my butter about two tablespoon of water that it get melted.
then we 'll be using ginger and all door, let it brown.
so i 'll be using some cumin seeds human.
see it 's actually, it 's optional.
so i 'll not be using much of him in season this and ginger, i have already put in my pressure cooker, and you can see it 's already on a high heat.
here will not be wasting time will be making circle in the meanwhile are the alice getting pressure cooker so my gender khuman seeds are done.
we 're both the garlic.
so you was around one tablespoon of garlic degeneres in getting a tarkov.
because punjabi circles if you will see my other recipes, you will sleep in java.
servers are always we use a lot of circles like and here goes my onions.
so i 'm using around one medium sized onion.
so that 's the reason i 'm again saying.
we have to be generous in using all the things in this.
my garlic is done is those onions just tutor for the adele.
it 's like a golden brown.
the onions are done so here goes my freshly, freshly done the from outer beauty.
so i 'm using around for medium size tomatoes.
if like you have the more quantity of car so you can put more tomatoes in this, so i 'll just recover this better let wake up five minutes.
and once it will was it will exert water.
sorry oil from it, then it 's done around like five to seven minutes, and you can see it have to has already lost, the it has started losing oil from it.
that means it stands masallah should be properly done.
so now i 'm going to put some salt in it sort, according to your taste, i 'll be using around one teaspoon of salt.
some red chili powder, if you want you can use more, i do n't use much, and you can use green chilies also in the meanwhile.
my just cooper will be getting reserved as my who could have just gotten vessel i can get the room up ginger and cloves from my marquee doll that 's just nothing.
it 's just getting bored so once you will make this way, you will get that aroma from this.
so my muscle is almost done.
i 'll just give one more whistle to my doll, and then i 'll just put the doll in the circle.
let me see, how my god looks like look at the texture look at the kidney beans over here at some ginger over this.
so we 're just gonna take this doll and put it to in my saucepan in better have already done.
the tampering so i 've just put all the doll in this, and i 'll just keep it owner between medium to high heat for around fifteen twenty minutes.
the actual way of making doll in pune jarvis.
we keep this in the morning, an it 's it will be done by the evening.
so what we call it as in punjabis, carnal, carnal means we have to put it on a slow or between low heat and let it cook, you know, slowly steadily and gives a nice flavor and color till.
but , yeah, if you want a good texture, keep this after putinga, tempering in all this, keep this for around one hour or.
so to get a royal taste.
but i will not be taking much time.
i 'll give like fifteen twenty minutes.
and i 'll just cover this with a lid and let it cook on medium heat for awhile.
it 's around fifteen minutes till he had and it 's still on like medium heat, and i 'll just give like fifteen more minutes to get professional.
the it just like thirty with all, so what i have to i 'll do is right now to get a good texture.
i 'll be using the spatula, and i 'll be mashing some doll this way.
so this will give a very nice texture to the doll, and this is the way the dhaba people make darlington job.
so you can use the masher, but we 're not matching.
all , but we 're mismatching like some work, done in this, so it will give a thick gravy also and hertz value.
and adds flavor to the dog, so i 'll just cover it with a lid for another fifteen minutes, check back in fifteen minutes.
we , gotta, i want to show you guys.
a professional royal doll mcnee, tallest like on slow cooking for around thirty minutes.
now look at the texture look at the colour.
so this is the consistency of the doll, which we actually need and which.
we actually have in the darbas.
so now it 's a time to just turn off the heat and use your heavy whipping cream.
first , i 'll be using some cilantro.
it was some cilantro, and now put some heavy whipping cream.
