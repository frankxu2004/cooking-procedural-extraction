hey guys, it 's lauren anne.
i finally have the sour kraut video for you today.
so i 'll show you how quick and easy, it is to make your own homemade sauerkraut.
so , the first thing you 'll need to do for making your sauerkraut is get out everything that you need.
and first you 'll need your cabbage so that i 'm using a green cabbage today.
and then we have caraway seeds.
there 's sort of they look and smell, kind of like human seeds, and then.
sea , salt and then a quart size mason jar with a lid and this one.
i actually have leftover, brine from my last batch, which you can reuse, and it 's actually helpful to reuse your leftover liquid from your last batch.
because there 's already, that, that lactobacillus bacteria in there, and.
so it helps the fermentation process.
go a little bit faster in your next batch because it 's already cultivated.
and then, the other thing you 'll need is a bowl to put this in, you want, like a good wide bull.
because you 're going to have both your hands in there.
so you want to have a lot of space to move around the only other thing.
you 'll need is a little like piece of tape or some kind of label to use to label the lid, and will put the date that you started your batch on the lid.
so that you can keep track of how long it 's been sitting out or how old.
it is after you put it in the fridge.
so we 'll start off by taking a little piece of cabbage off of the top because will be using it later when we get everything in our jar.
so i 'm just gonna it does n't matter.
it does n't have to be pretty, but you just peel off this top, and you can just put that to the side, OK.
and then we basically just want to take the core out of our cabbage and start shredding it up.
and you can either you to use a food processor for this, or you can use your knife to cut this into shreds.
and i 've done it both ways.
and when i use the food processor i find that it makes a lot smaller pieces.
and when i do it with the knife i can control the size of the pieces better.
and i can make it.
so that i get, like longer, longer slices, longer shreds of the cabbage and after doing that i find that i like the texture of the longer shreds and.
so i 'm going to cut this up with a knife and just cut it into nice thin slices and you can cut up into whatever size pieces you want.
but the smaller the better.
because that 's what 's going to give you that sauerkraut texture and it 's going to ferment faster an it 's going to help the process of getting the water, the liquid out of it.
so that you create your brine for the sauerkraut process so, i 'm going to go ahead and cut this up OK.
so we have the cabbage all shredded up here into nice thin slices just how i wanted them and you 'll see that this takes up pretty much the whole bowl right now.
but what we 'll do next, is at our caraway seeds an R salt, an will mix that in and then we 'll let it sit for like thirty minutes to an hour and what will happen is that the cabbage will begin to wilt.
because both the caraway seeds and the salt help to draw out the moisture from the cabbage and then at that point we 'll start to massage it.
and that will bring out more of the juice, more, the moisture.
and then we will have our brine.
are fermentation process.
so we 'll just do a tablespoon of the caraway seeds and then i have two tablespoons of sea salt ground up and then just lightly incorporating that trying to sort of spread it throughout all of the cabbage, and it 's fine if it does n't reach all of it just to help the wilting process?
we want it to come in contact with as much of the cabbage is possible, and like i said, the bigger the bowl better, she 'll have more room to play with here and you could even divide this up between two different bowls.
if you want it alright, so we have let our cabbage sit with the salt and caraway seeds for about an hour now, and you can see it 's.
that 's gone down about a third.
so we 're just going to start massage ing it now.
so getting your hands right in there and just basically squeezing cabbage and what we 're trying to do here is work out.
some of that liquid some of the juice from the cabbage and will cabbage a little more, and this is going to get a lot smaller and.
so much moisture will come out that will actually be able to put this in our corn size jar, and it will be covered in its own liquid or its own brine.
so i 've been massage, ing this for just a few minutes, and you can see there 's a good amount of liquid that 's come out already just from a few minutes of massage ing after we let it will put the salt and caraway seeds.
so this is about halfway there you can see the cabbage is really getting will tee it, almost kinda looks mushy and.
so we just want to massage this a little bit more alright.
so i 've got the cabbage all massage and there 's quite a bit of liquid in here might be able to see that and definitely is covering the top of the cabbage.
so i 'm going to transfer it to my mason jar which already has some of that leftover, brine in it i 'm going to start by just spooning in some cabbage with a big spoon, and if you got a particularly large cabbage, you may need to use another small jar, which is totally fine it does n't really matter how many jars it takes OK.
so i have my cabbage and brine packed in here do you want to you can use your hand.
or you can be like a pounder and just try and pack it all down to the bottom so that the water rises up and covers the top.
and then from here you want to get that cabbage leaf that you took off in the beginning before your shredded your cabbage.
you just wanna get a piece or two big enough to cover the top of your cabbage inside your jar, and then this actually stays down there, really good on its own.
this is basically to keep any college from rising to the top and being exposed to the air 'cause that can allow it to grow mold and you do n't really want to do that.
you want to keep it submerged, underneath the brine, and.
so this is actually staying down just fine on its own.
but you can also use something of way like you can put like large stones on top of the cabbage leaf, or i 've even used the shot glass before that.
i use for like my wheat grass, and i just stick the shot loss in there, and then screw the cap on an it, it gives enough pressure that it keeps the cabbage leaf down there.
and then we 'll just screw the lid on.
you want to have a good, you know, inch, or.
so at the top left of space for the air to be.
because air will be coming up from the bottom as it ferments and.
so you want some place for that to go.
so you do n't have an exploding glass jar and.
so the last thing that you want to do is label the top of the jar with some kind of label or tape with the date that you started this batch that you actually screw the top on, and set it on the counter.
so we have our cabbage packed in here and are cabbage leaf on top and our weight on top on our lid on tight with the date marked on there.
and now we just want to sit it out on the counter for three to four days, and that 's why we label it with the dates that we can reference that to see when it 's time to take it off of the counter and put it into the fridge.
so , after three or four days sticking it into the fridge and then you can just leave it there indefinitely.
and this stuff will last pretty much forever.
because the process of fermentation is actually a preservative method and that was one of the main reasons is used in, in cultures, originally was to preserve vegetables.
so i hope you enjoy this video.
and i hope you have tons of fun, making your own homemade sauerkraut.
and i would love to hear how your recipes turn out.
and i will post more videos of fermented veggies, and kimchi and maybe even some fermented beverages so until next time thanks for watching.
