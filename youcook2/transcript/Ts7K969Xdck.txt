welcome to japanese cooking rubbers.
this is yuri today.
i will show you how to make miso soup.
mississippi is something that 's japanese people eat everyday.
and you may be able to find mississippi in japanese restaurant in the united states, but this is a little bit different because this is more authentic.
basically , you can use any vegetables basic.
one is which means popular one is tofu and watt comment, which is seaweed and most likely you can see those ingredients.
one in japanese restaurant, but if you put more vegetables, of course takes much better.
so i 'm going to use today.
yellow zucchini, squash and onion, and this is diakon radish.
i already peeled and cut like half inch and force me so, and this is soup stock from combo, and this is how i cut it.
those are diakon radish.
i peel like that, and this is peeled.
and like half an inch fitness, and i just sliced them this, is onion?
i do slice thing and only unusually make suitcase reader.
and i 'd like it very much.
i usually make any visions same size.
because it 's easy to pick up that way.
so let 's see, this is almost same size that diakon radish, and i guess i will use three cups of dashie today.
and you are going to boil this dashi stock.
OK , it 's boiling.
so i will put all those ingredients in here vegetable already cooked and i 'm going to put me.
so now but before i put me.
so i turn off heat why i, i 'm doing that.
because misa has very good sent and also flavor overcooked.
that 's kill both of them.
so turn off the heat first.
then put me, so put me, so this is about one tablespoon and two tablespoons.
and you just put me so in there and just leave it for awhile anna miksis.
mix it later, or you can use do n't stuff and put me so in here and dump in the meso soup in mix with it in that.
is the other way too liquid for this kind of solid?
so , but if you do n't have it, that 's fine just dump to me.
so inside, and maybe thirty seconds, we still going to dissolve and gently mix.
do you still have this one, so, like that, then, when me.
so is dissolved, this is the mississippi and you taste it, and if it 's two week put more missile, and hopefully you do n't put too much, miss O from beginning.
but if too strong, which is too salty maybe you have to add more water or dashi stock?
so this is how to make authentic japanese meso soup, and basically you can use any vegetables from your refrigerator, and i recommend mushrooms, mushrooms taste very good and also fried tofu, which is very good, and we do n't call me.
but we sometimes put pork and that is very good because of flavor, but anyway, this is how to make very authentic very good taste.
japanese mississippi and i hope you enjoy this video, and this is japanese cooking lovers in this, is yuri?
thanks for watching.
