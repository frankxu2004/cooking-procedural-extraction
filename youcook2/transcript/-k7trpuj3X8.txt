hey dudes, i 'm highlight welcome to hilah cooking today.
i 'm going to show you how to make fried calamari like i learned how to do it from old greek lady anne.
it 's really easy and there 's only a few ingredients, but man, after you make this like as an appetizer at a party.
people are going to be like holy shit.
this is amazing.
and then it 's going to be gone like that.
so make sure that you actually get to taste them before you take it out to your guests tip from media.
here 's what we need.
so i 've got some calamari tubes and some flour salt pepper and some lemons.
but get outta here, lemons.
we do n't need you right now.
do is put the flower in our salt and pepper in the bag, and we 'll talk later on later?
and then so i 've got these calamari.
and these are just the tubes.
because my ding dong grocery store did n't have the whole squid.
so i ca n't show you like, how to separate the squid tubes from the tentacles.
but , but if you had the whole lens, and you just like pull out the beat, pull out the guts and then cut into.
both leave the tentacles hole, and then slice the body parts into the little ringlets that you see it like olive garden.
another fancy places alright.
so we want to cut these two about half an inch, thick, and we want to use a sharp knife and all the way through.
and then we got these little tubes, little ringlets.
alright so just thrown in your flour mixture a few pieces at a time, shake him up, and get it coated.
and i just got a clean plate here that i 'll set my little dredged rings on and just.
kind of use your hands to shake off the excess back into the bag.
cool , let 's try these puppies.
alright so i 've got my oil heated up here two three sixty five.
and i 've just been kind of monitoring.
and , adjusting it with the turning.
the heat up and down to keep it stable.
and i 'm going to drop these in new some tongue.
so that i can kind of like hold'em open like this.
so that i end up with little fried rings and not little fried blobs that are stuck together.
so and it 's going to double check my temp to make sure it has n't dropped two minutes make sure i do n't need to adjust.
we were still like three sixty so that 's good, and they should n't take more than two minutes.
that 's the key to not ending up with tough chewy, calamari, like.
so oftentimes happens it 'll probably more like a minute and a half or something and they 're popping and like fizzling a lot right now, and you 'll also notice as they start to cook and just happen magically right then, a lot less sizzling, and popping goes on.
so just kind of shoot him around.
now you do n't have to mesa phone.
but it kind of gives you more of a purpose when you 're standing here, slaving over a hot stove just kind of flip them over they get evenly round anyway.
but , you know, it 's something to do all right.
so you can see like compared to when i first dropped him in.
and they were all like, like little volcanoes, squirting everywhere, and they really, really calm down a lot.
you guys are really maturing annuar behaviors.
gotten a lot better since you first went into the oil.
so i 'm very proud of you.
OK things are done.
check it out.
it 's like golden brown and stuff like that, and we 're all crispy.
and it 's like a little ringlet, you OK.
so i just got a little paper towel.
then i 'm going to drain him on for a split sick OK.
so , these really do n't need anything but a little bit of lemon, and i think that 's really the best way to serve him.
just let him cool off for a second.
so , do n't burn, the heck out of my, you know, what my mouth awesome.
that 's a great little will snack appetizer or whatever it says fresh as a day at the beach.
but like when you first get to the beach not, when you leave.
because by then you 're all sticky and covered in sand.
so there 's how to make fried calamari, bloop, bloop alright, i hope you try it, and i will see you guys later.
