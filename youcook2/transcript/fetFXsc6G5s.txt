i 'm going to add two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and i 'm going to mix them all, well, and i 'm going to add luke warm water and mix it to adore.
so since i 'm using a fast action, east, i need not soak it in warm water.
so i 'm directly using it if you 're using the ordinary east.
check the specification and use accordingly also do n't use cold water.
then it will not activate the east at the same time, if you 're using very hot water, it will so finally i have a sticky dough.
it should be a little bit sticky so that you get solved nonce.
now i 'm going to apply some more oil on the top grease.
it well, and i 'm going to allow it to race for an hour if your place is a little bit chill, then you 'll need to two three hours.
usually i put it in there oven, so that it rises in one hour and now it is perfect, has doubled in size, and it is very sore next.
i 'm going to start rolling out their nonce.
first , i am going to duster worked up with some plain floor, and then i 'm also rubbing some floor in my hands.
and i 've taken a small ball of dough in my hands.
i 'm going to roll it out just a little bit.
if you want you can use more flow to does the surface and after rolling it to a small circle i 'm going to flip it in my hands.
so that i get there or will shape as in their rest torrent, and.
now my non is ready.
the next important step is i 'm going to apply some water on one of the sites.
and i 'm going to spread it with my finger, so that the entire area is covered with water.
you can use more water if necessary, and.
now i 'm going to put this water cider non on that tab, a use, a very hot ever.
so what is dripping the water side goes on their java.
only a very hi heater cover will give you good nons, so, after a few seconds, you will get bubbles coming now at this stage.
i 'm going to turn my java upside down with flame at high and i 'm going to cook than on other side on high flame and you can see non is ready.

i am grating one clove of garlic on top of their non and then i am dusting it with some floor.
so that the moisture from the garlic is absurd.
and i 'm going to gently roll it again a little bit, so that the garlic gets pressed inside their non.
and now you turn it to the other side, and apply water on the other side, do not apply water on their side, where you have applied there.
