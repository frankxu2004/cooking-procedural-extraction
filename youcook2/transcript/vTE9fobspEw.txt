hi , it 's stacy from one hungry mama making healthy corn dog bites.
so i 'm a total sucker for carnaval food.
i love it.
funnel cake and ice cream and best of all corn dogs.
the thing is corn dogs are n't really the healthiest thing and every once in awhile.
that 's fine when i really craving a corn dog at home.
i want it healthy and well portioned.
and that 's where this recipe came from to make these healthy baked corn dog bites.
you 're going to need cornmeal flour sugar, baking powder eggs.
yogurt milk, and of course, hot dogs you start by whisking all the dry ingredients in a bowl, then create a well in the middle and add the wet ingredients.
you want to get fancy.
you can mix the wet ingredients first and then add them, but honestly, these are corndogs.
let 's not be formal.
and when your batters done it 's going to be about the consistency of pancake batter.
once you have your batter, you want to make sure it is spray or mini muffin pan with foil.
so that these do n't stick then print it 's a little bit of batter at the bottom of every, well, that way your bites have a nice bottom to them, and i space drop in a little piece of hot dog.
pieces are about this, like squid that was half an inch thick, one hot dog will cut into about six pieces.
then cover the hot dog with the rest of the batter.
you bake these up for fifteen minutes, and they 're ready to go when these come out.
you have a moist kind of sweet corn muffin on the outside with the taste of salty hot dog on the inside.
it 's just like being at the carnaval only healthier, be sure to check the description below to see everything you need to make these healthy baked corn dog bites for more easy tips and quick family recipes you sure to visit me at one hungry mama dot com and do n't forget to subscribe a new video comes out every other week.
