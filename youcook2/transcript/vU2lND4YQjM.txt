in this video, i 'm going to show you how to make delicious temporal problems.
we 're going to need to marinate tempura prawns is some fish source.
some soya source, some thick teriyaki sauce, some season oil and some garlic.
and of course from real problems now what i 've done here is i 've cleaned the prawn and left the tailpiece on.
and now what i 'm going to do is cut three little slits here, here and here, three small slits.
one in the here one and one of the middle and one of the other end.
so that when you deep fry, it does n't curl up.
now keep that prawn straight.
now that i 've cut all the prawns, you add them into a bowl and you had about two tablespoons of fish or 's one teaspoon of soya sauce one teaspoon of thick teriyaki source half to one teaspoon of see some oil three cloves of minced garlic you mix allowed to marinate for about least minimum two hours to make the tempura mix simply mix one hundred grams of ready made tempura mix flour with one hundred sixty milliliters of water like.
so and there you go.
now to fry the temporal problems what you do is you pick it up by the tail dip it in to the mix into the japanese bread crumbs and then enter deep fryer, you can do, about two or three at the same time, do n't overload it and you want to the common nice golden brown this is about the colour were looking for nice golden yellowish brown, beautiful, temporal bones.
