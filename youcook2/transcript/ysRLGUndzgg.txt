hi , welcome to my home kitchen.
i am bona and today, i 'm making hot sweet and sour so it 's a combination of hot, spicy, sweet, sour.
and , this is the indochinese fusion in virtually very quick way of making it, so here i have the part.
i need the part.
i 'm going to add the olive oil.
you can use anyone, you using in the cooking but olive oil enhances.
the flavor of the you can make either hot and sour or sweet.
but i kind of, like combination of hots meeting.
so this oil is there and here i have some vegetables that i have that evenly sliced this all vegetable.
so that it cooks.
but i have the green bell pepper carrots onion i 'm using red onion.
but you can use any onion you how an i have the cabbage.
now for the vegetables the list goes on and on you can use any vegetable set you like the endless possibilities for adding vegetables here, i have the minced ginger, and garlic, an i have here, the noodles, i 'm using the instant noodles.
because this soup is going to be quick soup and this instant would also it is this guy usually by from indian grocers it 's actually curry it comes at the brand is top ramen curry and it 's a spicy tasty has it comes with the spices and i 'm not going to use the spice.
but i 'm just trying.
so i 'm using this instant noodle and here i have my alsa sees in everything.
so we 're going to start adding first, particularly i had apart into the path the first goes onion and carrots bell pepper, and here i have this cabbage great thing cabbage, you can see that.
so all the vegetable cooks at the same time, and we do n't want to overcook all over with tables or on a medium heat and get a quick stir add just a pinch of salt here i had the vinegar.
so this predictable, i 'm going to add this model and here i have the vegetable stock broth one cup, give me disturb again you can use water instead of a vegetable broth or stock.
but if you want to really flavorful soup, then always use the vegetable broth or stock here i have the minced garlic and ginger here i have the soy sauce about a tablespoon or that 's all i have actually, yeah, hot, sauce mine is not that much hot.
so i 'm using.
but half teaspoon.
but you can adjust your taste here is my sweet and sour sauce, you can use as much as you want.
because this is nice taste so, i 'm going to add about couple of tablespoon alright you disturb.
now we can increase the temperature again into a little bit higher medium to high, i 'm also going to add sesame E seed soil.
nice favor, just a little bit not too much.
now you want to bring these two rapid boil.
so i 'm going to cover it, roll my eyes now so wonderful here.
so i 'm going to let it boil there a bit here.
i have this make it make this soup thick.
i 'm using today error powder.
i only share if you want to make the gravy or any sauce or any soup.
if you want to make it little thick, or you can use the cornstarch all the error.
now if you ask me the question which one is the better than i would say error powder.
because it 's more healthy to use the error powder it also gives the shine to any recipe and little glow that you see like, that 's why this is the, you know, most share if you prefer to use error powder or cornstarch.
so i have your dear old powder that i 'm going to use to make this tape to make this soup.
little think now my intends to make this soup is.
i want sometimes i would like to eat lots of tofu and sometimes i would like to eat boiled egg or anything that can add little protein to your diet.
that 's, that 's where these silk comes in for me.
i mean, you can use anytime you want, but that 's what it is usually if i have to eat tofu.
i can eat just as it is i had to add model spices to it.
otherwise , i can eat the tofu and i would love to add that to my diet.
so these are some of the ways that i have found that i can it to full and the vegetables.
sometimes i love to eat mushrooms.
so i and a lot of mushroom do this soup, so, anything that you can think of you can just have your own imagination.
your own creation, and you will love this soup.
however you make it alright.
so this is coming to the bottle at this time.
i 'm going to add this error root powder now this eric holder, you can simply add directly into the interview.
any recipe you do n't have to dissolve into the water just like cornstarch that you have to do.
so i 'm going to bring it down to the low again and look at this.
super already looks nice color, so, i 'm ready to add this powder and quickly try to starve, and this will make the soup take.
see how it 's getting thicker quickly look at that.
see if you want to add the boiled egg.
but i normally do i boil the egg in a separate pot and then cut into pieces, and i add those pieces into this soup, you can simply use kinnear, even if you want premier.
but if you looking for healthy diet, then tofu or the boiled egg is the best option.
and of course vegetables i 'll be here any materials that you might hear.
i have the toll full, now.
i have a, i was trying to cut very thin, so i have the pieces do n't look good.
but that 's OK, so into my soup, is it looks perfect at twelve full?
you can add as much as you want, so look at this soup, i 'm going to just a couple of it since i added a tool for now.
and i think i have left is the spring onion the green onion, or the scallion.
there are usually sprinkled on the top, you can also add while you cook other vegetables.
but i kind of, like the war chest of it, and still.
let 's see how to soup is doing gorgeous look.
so young, so i have my own bowl and that 's just for me.
so this also this for me this whole part is for i 'm going to check out.
came to my.
balls , very hot in, that is, if you want end on the top here, i have the chopped green onion, you can use to finally chopped cilantro if you do n't have the green onion, my super bowl looks.
so yummy i ca n't wait to try sometimes i also add the garbanzo beans.
because all i want is just a protein with vegetables, and i really love this soup and part.
so we usually i make the vegetable spring rolls to go with this soup.
but today it was.
just me myself so i got lazy.
and i just made the soup, and this is just all about the hot sweet and sour, cereal soon with the next great recipe.
