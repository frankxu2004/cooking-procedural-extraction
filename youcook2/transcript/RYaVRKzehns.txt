i want to make some visulas.
we 've been working hard.
i 'm out of the rubber gear as you can see it started to get a bit cold actually.
so i 've changed out of that.
but i still got these muscles his muscles marine year are classic, and the whole trick not to do too much to a muscle because these will be beautiful.
we need a big old cast iron pan on the fire there with a splash of oil piece of garlic just like that really set off of the north pop that, on the board there, and, we need him a little rough chop there long is a nice and small worst thing in the world is a big old chunk of garlic between the two back teeth, straight into the pan.
but this is n't a that small onion, and we 're just talking them up into little squares and into the pan.
there 's some heating it far right now, i want to.
i want to put a little bit of lemongrass, and i think the lemongrass we 're nice flavor.
it 's kind of a tie kind of number really lemongrass beautiful peppermint, spearmint, kind of feel to it pop him in the fire disc E.
but taking over just letting the flavors out of the garlic in the onions.
it 's all about these muscles.
they look at these beautiful, we had the same muscle in the UK.
we use them a lot.
but there more about this size.
now that their goal plump muscle and i 'm really interested to know if this long growth period.
because of this cold water make some maybe more tasty or something like that anyway straight into a hot pan.
so they were there.
now just taking away and.
now we need to give him something to steam up with.
so little bit of seven jan block here.
and we really just need to splash or two of this.
maybe one more, i guess and let them to sit for about a minute.
and what starts to happen.
they start to open, look at that they are big fat and juicy ca n't wait for that.
you could sit here waiting for your muscles to cook all day long ever changing landscape, anyway.
there 's a sizzle coming on these and that wine is starting to make those muscles open up so as it starts to happen.
we now need that cream to go and so just a little bit of cream comes off the boil at that stage.
and they sort of half open.
we now need them to fully open.
they just give up their juices they give up that little bit of C, and you end up with an oyster.
mussel soup, in the bottom of some plump lovely muscles to eat off the top.
it 's not really the way they have it here in the screen and julius was saying that they often put into a soup with some other types of seafood.
but i think this with, uh, a bit avail crusty bread, you know, every once in awhile one of those icebergs out there cracks or rolls over or something.
i do n't know, but it 's a really eerie sound such a magical place.
it come back to the boil now.
the cream is boiling away all the muscles have opened up in this spring open releasing those juices there just perfect for serving.
i can smell white wine.
i can smell attach agalloch.
but mostly i can smell those muscles going to serve these up into a big old bowl.
i do look good.
big just pour a bit of that over the top like that, big old chunk of crusty bread like that bowl and muscles like this.
i gotta taste one delicious really.
like those big flavor big muscle flavor.
nice and plump beautiful.
