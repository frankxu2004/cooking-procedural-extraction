hi , it 's jayden from steamy kitchen.
and we 're making vegetable egg rolls are also known as spring rolls.
but my mom has always called them egg.
rolls this is.
the filling is delicate and full of vegetables like bamboo shoots.
chinese black mushrooms, bean sprouts, cabbage and carrots, and of all recipes i 've ever made this is, by far one of the most popular with cabbage.
i 'm using napa cabbage, but you can use regular cabbage.
whatever you 'd like if you 're using napa cabbage, go and cut it down the middle just like this and go and start shredding you can also do this in the food processor.
but , you know, what i found it 's just easier to clean to shred them with a knife than to use a food processor for the carrots.
julian them with a knife or food processor, or you can buy already pre cut matchstick cut carrots or you can use my favorite way with this five dollar, oxo, julian tool, which does very, very quickly.
i use a fork to anchor down the charatan, look how thin and beautiful these julian slices are just going to cut down the length.
just a bit.
these are canned bamboo shoots, you find them in the age, and i live drained them.
and i 'm just going to run my knife through them just to make them similar shape.
and size as the carrots.
now for the mushrooms you can use fresh shataiki mushrooms if you like or really any type of mushrooms, you want.
but these are dried chinese mushrooms.
they come and ride form just like this.
and you rehydrate them by soaking them in water at incredible flavors as savory deep mushroom flavor that you really ca n't get with just fresh mushrooms.
so that 's why i love using.
dried chinese mushrooms discard the tough stem and the chop up the cat.
these are being sprouts.
there 's a tail and there 's ahead and what you want to do is pinch off and discard.
the tales, which is really the root and keep the rest of it when i was little, my mom used to make me do this, all the time.
it was so incredibly tedious.
so , you know what i 'm sorry, mom.
i 'm not going to do it.
you throwing it all in he.
does he walk, or a large saute pan.
an adding your ginger, garlic and green onion keep your heat on low, you do n't want to bring these aromatics, cibles, everything.
but the bean sprouts add bean sprouts in later.
because you want them to stay crisp and crunchy stir fry.
and now when it 's almost towards the end of the stir fry it adding your bean sprouts season with soy sauce.
here 's a secret tip.
once you 're done with the stir fry lay everything all the vegetables out on a baking sheet.
this cools down the filling very quickly.
the reason why this is important, is because if you try to use hot steaming hot filling to rap with?
it 'll make the skin of the egg roll.
also another tip, prop up the baking sheet.
so that any extra or a sauce reduces collects at the bottom and you can throw that away, discard that any extra liquid this helps prevent your egg roll again from being soggy makes coolwater with cornstarch to make a slurry.
this is sort of your glue.
you can also use an egg wash if you want.
but i like using cornstarch and water.
this is my very favorite brand of egg roll wrappers or spring roll shells.
you get these at the asian market you 'll find him in the frozen section annual defrost them in the fridgerator overnight or just.
leave him out on your counter for about forty five minutes.
credibly , thinan, very, very light.
and they crisp up like crazy rappers that you can find at regular supermarkets that are not frozen there.
usually near the tofu in the vegetable isle.
i do n't like those at all.
they 're too thick.
they bubble up and they 're just, too doughy.
so i always buy these rappers.
other good brand that i also buy is called spring hill tip.
keep them wrapped up in plastic wrap or a damp paper towel because they will try out very easily.
and it 's very hard to roll make sure your work surface is dry and clean.
that 's also very important in your wrapper in a diamond shape at about a heaping, tablespoon of filling you.
do n't want to add too much because it 'll burst if you add too much filling roll them up super, super tight?
put your finger right there to make a fold.
a nice hospital corner, fold and again on the other side and roll all the way up.
now this is what you do not want to.
do , do you see how it looks a little wide there, and there 's basically an opening?
will oil can seep in it?
make sure egg rolls very oily, so you want to make sure that you 're folding them so that there 's no air bubbles.
no pockets and no holes paint the remaining corners with the cornstarch slurry and roll all the way up came back tugging back just a bit every time just.
so that you 've got a very tight roll and that is it OK.
i 'll show you again.
step one is to wipe down your surface, lay down the egg roll wrapper.
you have diamond shape and add just about a heaping, tablespoon of filling into this corner bottom corner, right here and roll up tightly.
roll up that corner and tug back.
just a bit just to make sure it 's tight, use your finger to pinch pulled over a pinch.
fold over an roll.
the west rest of the way up paint.
the two corners with the cornstarch slurry.
i 'll show you what it looks like it should look tight small.
maybe about an inch and a quarter in diameter and no visible holes put them, lay them flat on a baking sheet can make sure you cover it with a damp towel.
very , very damp towel or plastic wrapped to prevent them from drying is another tip.
if you 'd like to freeze them, freeze them just like this, or just make sure that they are on a single layer turned out to have them touch freeze them first.
and then once they 're frozen, you can gather them up and put them in a freezer bag.
if you try to squish them too tight or have them overlapping while in the freezer will just freeze in a giant clump, and then you wo n't be able to get them apart and to cook them frozen.
all you have to do is put them directly frozen into the hot oil just be very careful.
you do n't need to defrost them OK back to the fresh egg rolls.
i 've got some hot oil and i 've got a baking sheet with the racks.
and i 'm going to make sure that the oil is hot enough.
here 's a tip that i learned from my mom.
take a uncoded, chopstick or a wooden spoon.
the handle over wooden spoon.
it , in the oil i promise you 're not going to damage your chopstick or wooden spoon place.
it into the oil and if you see no bubbles, it 's not quite ready, yet when you do see bubbles, that 's when your oil is hot enough to fry called, the ancient chinese thermometer, you can see here that it 's not quite ready.
yet OK, a couple minutes later you can see bubbles come now.
it 's ready and the egg rolls very carefully do n't make sure you do n't flatter yourself and just fry until browned.
remember they filling is already cooked inside.
we stir fried that earlier, so it really all your doing is browning the outside.
but when i also wanted to tell you how my dad likes to enjoy the egg rolls, you take one bite from the egg roll and pouring a little bit of chinese black vinegar or, if you do n't have chinese black vinegar, just a little bit of balsamic vinegar in the sweet tangy sharpness of the vinegar, oh, it 's for chinese egg rolls for the full recipe, or if you have any questions at all, head over to steamy kitchen dot com, slash one twenty one more easy asian recipes head over to steamy kitchen dot com or pick up a copy of my brand.
