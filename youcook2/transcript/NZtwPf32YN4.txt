i 'm going to show you how to make the most beautiful creamy scrambled eggs.
you can imagine, and these scrambled eggs are the perfect a compliment to mighty smoke salmon to begin take the eggs.
so i 'm using free range eggs, crack about seven in here.
but it is to crack the eggs on a flat surface.
not near to the bowl, and you reduce the chance of getting eggshell in the mix, OK, now that i 'm going to add such a milk.
some double cream.
this is just add a little bit of richness without making it too creamy.
and then a little bit of butter touch of seasoning and then just give it a light wisc i do n't know.
where is this too much story?
incorporate too much air into the mixture and then just place the bowl over a pound, or very lightly simmering water there.
we need to do is just be patient and stir the idea.
here is to click these eggs loan slow, and that 's why i 'm put in bold set over the water is much more delicate heat.
we 're looking for.
is that egg mixture to start to thicken almost to a custard?
and then form very delicate creamy lumps in it, it should take about fifteen minutes.
i want to finish these scrambled eggs with a few drops of burnsed 'cause it is butter that 's cooked until the proteins the milk solids start to caramelize and you get this wonderful nutty character to it.
so it 's simple to make this is a really good example of how you use all your senses in the kitchen.
what happens the button will start to sizzle.
and as it sizzles what 's happening is the water containing the butter is evaporating once all the waters.
evaporated there 's nothing there to keep the bottle call, so the button will start to get hotter turn.
and then develop this beautiful, so nothing characteristic would be very careful.
age is black bottle which is burned and not very nice.
OK , that bus stops his limbs, even smells wonderful nutty aroma just skim off the impurities.
the phone from the surface and then pass the whole thing, i 'm using a coffee filter paper, but a jay cloth will do the trick coming through.
there is this beautifully golden nutty butter based in there for the smoke salmon.
all i 'm doing is just taking some of the sound.
i 'm just going to slice it.
we 're looking for with scrambled eggs, is to be creamy as opposed to trying grainy, add the smoke salmon to the scrambled eggs.
just combine it put it on to the toast and then to finish few drops of the burners act.
and this is drop.
is sherry vinegar?
