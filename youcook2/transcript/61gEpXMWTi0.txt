and she 's asked me to make some cold cannon, the irish classic, and one of my favorites, so let 's gets done he 's got persian nails mind.
they want you wo n't food friday.
what else can we share and snickers, henschen letter, satisfying meals opera.
so guys, the first thing that we 're going to get started on our coal cannon is cook our potatoes.
now i 'm using two potatoes for this.
i 'm using just ordinary white, washed bleach potatoes.
but i 'm also going to be using a sweet potato.
because i want the contrast of the two flavors.
now just into a large part.
here i 've got some boiling salted water, and i 'm going to add in our potatoes, and i 've just cut them up into chunks.
now i want you to try this making mashed potatoes.
OK , i want you to cook the potatoes through over this boil so it 's a medium to high heat.
and we 're going to cook this for about eight to ten minutes until those potatoes are nice and soft.
and we can match them.
it goes with the same, mesh them.
we want that real rustic sort of chunky look.
we do n't want to smooth potato puree so that 's where i want my potatoes done.
so i 'm just going to leave them in the bowl and let them cool down.
and while they 're cooling down, we 'll get started on our cabbage, and also on our milk mixture.
so with our cabbage, what i 'm going to do is just cook it very, very quickly.
because i still want to cabbage to have some crunch to it.
play part of simmering salted water.
i 've got some green cabbage here that i 've just shredded up and this is only going to need about five minutes.
that 's all over a medium heat here.
now , over here on a smaller source been what i 'm going to be doing.
is making a milk and spring onion or scallion mixture so just into a pen here over medium heat i 'm going to be adding in some milk and just for some real fantastic.
flavoring , and it will just all work, when this is done.
i 've got some ground nutmeg that i 'm just going to adding to the milk and of course, i 've got some green spring green onions or some scallions.
but i 'm just going to be adding to the milk as well, for about three to four minutes over high heat until that milk.
swarm through and those green onions just start to soften slightly, so this is all our cabbage needs.
so i 'm going to now drain this off the heat 's off.
and i 'm going to drain it now as you can see here.
our milk is starting to just boil around the edges now when that starts happening.
i 've just got of butter here and i 'm just going to place that in the middle, and i want that to meltdown.
and that 's going to give this milk mixture here with a spring onion.
a real creamy, velvety texture, so, that is now done.
OK , well, that 's exactly where we want it, so we 're going to turn the heat off now, we can assemble alcohol, cannon.
so we 've got everything here.
we 've got our potato mash.
we 've got our spring onion milk mixture an hour cabbage, just here.
so what i 'm going to do first is grab our cabbage and place it now.
and then i 'm going to pour over our milk and spring onion mixture, and.
now i want you just to mix all that together.
so we just got some charge in the middle, and i want to sprinkle over some more spring onions or scallions, just over the top.
so guys they have it, there 's my version of colcannon, i absolutely love it.
and i love the way it looks.
it just looks with the chives in the spring onions like those potatoes are just still growing in the ground, and you just want to get stuck into that cabbage.
the two types of potato and man that 's one exactly what i 'm going to do right.
now get stuck in.
so a real personal favorite of mine is called ken and i absolutely love it i had it.
so many times growing up as a kid and i 've changed it over the years and this is my favorite tack on it so, here we go as always such good flyers and that combination of the sweet potato the normal potato work really well, and it 's just.
so tasty and more she just want more and, more, and, more and you can have this as a meal by itself and if you really wanted to get creative with it had some bike into it, you know, it will just bring it alive again.
so many different variations you can have it as a main meal, or as a side dish it 's up to you.
but in any case, you gotta give this a try.
so called cannon i hope you give this one a try it is, so.
so good and i love it, it 's one of my personal favorites all the ingredients are below.
so check it out i 'll see you this friday for another fast food recipe.
so until then, you take care.
