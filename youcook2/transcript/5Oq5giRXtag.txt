hi , everyone today i 'm going to show you how to make your own buffalo wings i am using chicken wingettes and you want to coat them in lori season salt, you do n't want to use too much 'cause that 's a lot of salt, you may look like i 'm using a lot.
but i 'm not really using that much, do you want to prepare your better i 'm using about a cup of flour a little bit of purp rica a little bit of black pepper and a little bit of cayenne pepper, oh, and also a little bit of salt.
now using seesaw.
because i could n't find the regular stop, and just want to mix that in really, really good, then you, wanna get a zip lock bag, and you wanna put your chicken wings in the bag they 're gonna answer flower to it and give it a really, really good shake.
so that all of the chick in is lightly coated with the flower then you want to take it out and put it in a container or put it on a plate and then you want to cover whatever you put the chicken in covered with saran wrap and put in the refrigerator for about thirty minutes one hour always do thirty minutes.
because i 'm always ready to eat wow that 's in the refrigerator, you want to start making your buffalo sauce and to make that always use hot sauce.
i really like to use franks, red hot pepper sauce.

garlic powder melted butter.
