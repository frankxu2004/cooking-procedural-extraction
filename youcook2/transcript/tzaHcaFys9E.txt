hi , my name is like me.
i 'm going to show you how to make sushi with nikki lee sushi maker.
what it does, is basically a mold?
so you stuff to rise sushi rice instead of the mold and then press it down.
so this makes two sushi instantly what you need is a ball of water in order to keep your hands wet, so the race wo n't stick to you.
of course, you need sushi rice.
we have nori, which is seaweed and fresh summer masotti.
and so she ginger, well, first of all, you need to cut sushi mary into a strip.
this is how you do it as you can see.
there 's a lying running along the nori.
this is how you fold it along the line will come apart by folding with half like this, now.
take this piece, you need scissors for this one.
just make very fine strips of about one centimeter.
this is going to bind the social together with the summer at any time.
keep the seed away from the washer.
otherwise it will shrink booking.
i think we 're ready to make sushi get the mold get your hand wet.
to keep the mold slightly wet.
i think in a towel.
so he wants rice wo n't stick take some rice and start stuffing and then take the pusher and push it down simple, as that.
take this out and when you turn it around you have tabs one on each event so you just gently place thumbs over the top and press.
just push it down like that.
now you have couple of centuries, they might be slightly jointed so just take, take him away.
next thing you do is that blower, sabi on the back of the fish, then, turn it upside down, said wishabi side is hidden in order to make it pretty are also to make it bind together.
so they wo n't fall apart.
is to have serious trip over it and then gently rap it around, there will stick naturally.
because of the moisture that 's coming from the rice and fish here?
we are put them into the plates and serve it with sushi ginger on the side and so sauce.
