OK , i 'm originally from sheboygan, wisconsin.
and that happens to be ground zero for brought worst period.
i believe the correct method for making brats is genetically imprinted on my DNA, so this is not just my opinion.
it 's science, so we start with the braatz.
now there are thousands of types and some are good.
most are n't first thing.
do not get precooked, brats, you can find good ones?
if you 're lucky, lokoli.
but johnson ville, brotz are available all over the us, there made in sheboygan and their excellent.
another thing is the role in the sheboygan area make the perfect hard roll.
these are not readily available and an acceptable substitute is a kaiser bun.
i suggest staying away from the white bread hamburger buns, and those things called brought buns 'cause those are just hot, dog buns anyway.
if you ca n't find a real hard roll, go for the kaiser bun now to cook them, charcoal is recommended, but a gas grill.
and it 'll do whatever you do n't close the cover.
you need the braatz.
of course, tongs a squirt bottle and a beverage.
remember , this is man land.
so something you do not need is your spouse telling you how to do it.
so you want your fire one called deep not terribly hot, maybe six or eight inches below the great and on, they go, oh, one thing do not pre cook these in any way.
we do n't boil them first.
they go rala right on to the grill, i mean, they do n't boil your steak before you throw it on the grill.
do you because there uncovered you 'll occasionally get a flare up?
that 's what this court bible is forum now.
these are looking good.
now this one is not quite ready to turn with the right fire.
we want to do about five minutes per side.
all four sides about twenty minutes, total.
let me tell you.
there is nothing like the smell abroad smoke on a summer afternoon when they 're all nice and dark brown.
they 're ready to come off, and it 's time for the next step.
OK , now we 're going to simmer them in beer for a little while.
and you do n't need your expensive microbrewer import for this.
just about anything will do.
you can also put a little butter in here and some people even cut up onions and put those into, but remember we 're going to simmer not boil.
if you did this right there are already cooked as i said earlier hard rolls are hard to find.
but here 's what one looks like now, we for little butter on the role and for me a slice, iranian.
and it is ready to go.
i guess ketchup and mustard and sauerkraut are OK, but i usually only use that stuff at the company.
picnic , when they 're making precooked using or braatz or something like that, you know, just to cover up the taste.
and it 's also best to eat him outside, if at all possible and there, you have it.
