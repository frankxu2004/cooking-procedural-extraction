they want to draw being mixed up.
never going to divide it into, say tennis ball size meatballs, once we got the meatballs done talking to make the source.
OK , we 're going this hot source from there or, in some extra virgin, olive oil and put it in their large brown onion.
OK , they 're starting to go brown not gonna add in a seven hundred gram jar, or pesada sod is just a really nice tomato source that i 'm going to add in a eight hundred gram, ten of crushed tomatoes.
salt give me a good stare.
OK once you brought, it to the boil, then we can apply.

and we 're gonna let it simmer for forty, forty five minutes.
OK , well, the source is simmering got falling water.
and we 're going to add in some salt.
they were getting flight hundred grams of spaghetti.
we 're going to cook that until it 's al dente in the past.
