put this quick and easy recipe.
we 're going to start off by boiling potatoes in a big pot.
i 'm using a lot of potatoes because i am making a big batch of these.
so you can use as many as you want, in a mixing bowl, you can start off by putting two and a half cups of all purpose flour, along with the flower, you can also add one tablespoon of cumin seed saw is literally the preference of the person.
but we 've added two teaspoons of saw in this.
then we 're also adding a quarter cup of oil as of right now.
you want to go ahead and start mixing.
and you want to mix all the oils and everything to the point where if you were to moshe in your hands you start to get chunks in AM.
we need the dough to be hard and not soft.
so we 're slowly adding water to what we want to do with it once under the flower has been just combined together.
you , wanna go ahead and start meeting this on a counter just.
so you can break everything down completely and makes everything in your hands and this is how the consistency should look if you can get a wet cloth and display sit on top of that it will be great.
because that 's going to avoid it from getting hard at the top.
now for the filling you 're going to need salt, khuman seed and red chili pepper.
the other ingredients, you 'll need or freshly, chopped cilantro freshly chopped mint, and you 're going to need some green chili peppers.
all of these vegetables came from a frozen packer can pick these up at a local grocery store in the very inexpensive.
so i am going to be using green beans, carrots, and peas.
then you want to go ahead and start mashing all your potatoes up.
but try to keep them to the point where you 'd have chunks in AM.
now in a frying pan.
you want to use quarter cup of oil.
then , you want to drop in all of your khuman seed and let it fry up on top of that.
you 're going to add in all of the vegetables and disturb them around for about five minutes.
once you 're frozen vegetables, have already you can go ahead and add them into the mixing bowl with the potatoes?
add in your pepper, your saw and the freshly chopped up herbs makes everything very well.
because you want all other flavors to be distributed evenly throughout the samosas to start with the rap of the symbol.
so we 're going to be rolling our dough into little golf size balls, and then we 're going to flatten them out to the texture and the softness in the flatness and everything to the size of a tour.
tila keep rolling until the dough becomes really, really flat.
if your app is imperfect, you can go ahead and just cut off the edges to make it a circle and then cut it in half.
so you have a half of a circle and then you want to put water around the straight edge and fold them together into a little triangle make sure you place one flap over the other and then you wanna press against the flap.
so when you deep fry them they wo n't open up in all of the vegetables wo n't come out of it.
so press as hard as you can.
so they completely stick together, then you 're left with this cone.
start flying debt in with the potato mix, using wider again.
we 're going to be applying that on the rim of the samosa and then we 're going to close them together.
have grabbing one end of the samosa in bringing it forward to the edges that were connected to the flaps that were connected, you want to keep that side on the front close, the back of it tored the front, and then this press against the bottom and you 've made a samosa.
now deep frying is pretty typical?
you just turn on the stove and let the oil heat up and then just deep fry it and there.
you go that 's your.
