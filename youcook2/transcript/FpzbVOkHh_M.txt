so come to childless kitchen today.
i 'm going to make a very authentic up speciality dish of officers, called cinema sala chula, vassallo, you can say, or chickpea, masala.
it 's not a rocket science very easy to make an relieve.
even jabees love chair over summer know and really a mystery people, they want to have like china masala, every model.
it took days.
i 'm not from a mercer, but i am married on this.
are , so, i know how it is so let me introduce you guys what ingredients?
i need for this recipe because we will be making it the restaurant style adversary style.
so i want to tell you all the ingredients, we need for this because we do n't want to compromise on the ingredients.
or we do n't want to compromise on your taste.
so if you want the job it is.
so let 's see, what actually, we need here is the chick pea.
you can say chile, which i saw overnight, just gave one missile in the pressure cooker.
and it 's done.
so , if you will take in your fingers mash it, it 's getting matched, so this is what we need in there to lay.
there 's some people put in a pressure cooker there.
put some two three D backs in that, along with that, they 'll put this card a masala that is barely some clothes and some black cardamom in it.
i do n't do that because i like to add karama sala in my circa in my tapping.
and for the D backs i 'm not.
i have not used teabags in this what i 'll do, is?
i 'll microwave with some water in it.
this is like two titties phone of tea black tea.
i 'm using i 'll piper with this for one, one, one minute and then, i 'll show you how reporting in this it will become really black.
so the secret of this recipe i would say blackness comes from this TI platea and custody maybe this is really super.
ingredient for this recipe, and for our tempering will be using bay leaves graphs around ten to twelve class.
and around three to four black cardamoms so you can break black cardamom this way, i 've already break broker, it, it 's really hard.
so we need around half medium sized.
finally , chop onions see it 's really finely.
you , if you do n't want to shop it, just fury it and fury it the way.
i have to write this tomatoes, so i have around four to matters because the again secretive in this recipes tomatoes.
automatics will use more, you will get the time nist flavor, so form for medium size tomatoes, freshly period.
some sort, the sun, red chili powder sub sugar, then chana, masala porter, this is a real secret.
so her out two tablespoon of chama salon using in it sometime we could based and some amateur border that is, try mango powder anardana that is forming grade seeds, and for garnishing we need less choppy ass that is clutcher onion cut in this way.
you get this, this will used for garnishing with the lengths by sliced ginger in it.
restart the process once your journey, or, boy it does n't take much time to get this dish time so my oil is already heated up here.
i have used around two tablespoons of oil here goes my day leaves some people really do n't like it.
but i like to use if it 's party special or if it 's not party special, then also i like to use this paramus, alasan here goes black cardamom.
i 'm using around three blackboard ones in there just give it a still there and will like, stare this for one minute that, when your cloth get popped up, it, it means it 's done here.
it goes the onions.
no garlic interest entity but gender, yeah, we will be using at the end just from garnishing more human seeds.
nothing in this, this use onion share.
this , and it 's like folding browns, then will be footing our theory, it will take like two to three minutes to get it down my onions, are done there?
it just makes it we have to cook until at least the oil from the sides.
i 'll be putting some sort and fundaments in it right.
now some sort, according to taste.
so i 'm using i would say for one cup of chickpeas.
because i 'm using it on one cup of chickpea.
i 'm using around one teaspoon of salt.
some rachel recorder, yeah, if you guys like green chili, you can add accordingly, i do n't add.
so i 'll just cover this for five minutes and will check back after five minutes in the meanwhile.
i have already put my T over here.
if you have tea bags, i do n't use teabags.
that 's reason i 'm doing this way for one minute, and it 's like five minutes.
i would say it 's gonna take more five ten minutes.
i would say so.
we want really, are tomatoes to get cooked well.
so that 's the reason it 's going to take time.
because the recipe secret again is tomatoes should not be under coach.
it should we all looked, well, so, so look at the masallah.
is it looking like a it have.
started , leaving oil so that means it 's done at this point, up front.
we 're going on port at channel.
we do n't want to, you know, put more water in this because this is never watering.
just search enormous allies like it 's like a semi gravy so we do n't want a much crazy.
so i 'll be just hoping this by hand because i do n't want to put further along with will put water slowly in it.
so , once you put all the chinanet at this point of time i like to use my tea black tea.
so just train it in a strainer.
so it will take a time to like get it color in it.
so at this time, i 'm going to put all the masalas here, was my channel?
here goes my amateur border.
and , and are donna, pomegranate seeds.
OK , go some sugar around half teaspoon of sugar.
here go some tamron, facetime using this adds a flavor, some tanginess and sugar.
add some, you know, sweetness to this dish.
if you feel it 's not very black.
you can just put some more tea just to boil it in the microwave for around one and a half minute and put it the way you want.
so i 'll just check back.
because it takes some time to get the color, so, check back.
i 'll just cover this with a lid for around five ten minutes and check will check back and it 's one commedia feet.
i would say ten minutes.
it 's cooking, and do n't you think it 's look at the color is n't it.
looking unnecessary toilet.
so i 'll give like five more minutes and at this time, you can check any sword or anything you wanted to add earn.
so just, you know, stick to the ingredients.
i have told you if you ever have channa, masala you can add on more on two quarter, that is tried.
michael porter, and more of like if you have ginger border in your house use that it will add flavor to it if you have the numbers are like nothing yes, you know, nothing is special.
you want in that, so just i 'll cover it with a lid again and check back after five minutes.
so it, it 's ready, it took me like twenty minutes to get it free early kuttan, get the color, the texture.
because when we put the black tea in the way i have told you, it needs some time to cook in it.
so at this point of time i 'm just turning up the heat.
put kasturi, methi, a nerd, and here goes from the church gas, the crunchiness of this little piers.
it 's really amazing is some ginger.
i had put some over here because i want some to be cooked with my charlie.
here goes a ginger.
some sliced lengthwise, flies cut ginger, and it 's done just for some cilantro and ready to serve.
you can say china masala this is what color.
we eat over there.
it 's never read, you know, oranges in colored so yes.
you definitely have to put in keypads annette.
grant enough so that you can recover try out the way.
i have told you it 's not so difficult, very easy to make money real good party dish.
