we 're here in west hollywood at luke or legendary chef.
an author of the slanted door charles span is here to share his famous spring roll recipe, which has been enjoyed by jake gillenhall, ashton, kutcher, mila, kunas and even.
michelle obama chef.
so excited to be here, and i understand that you serve over eighty thousand spring, rolls every single year at your restaurant, people must love this thing.
we actually, in the kitchen, still, this thing every day and i 'm not sick of it and the second one is chicken noodle soup, so.
but this is really like your secret weapon, i mean, this is what kind of started the restaurant, yeah, yeah, and it 's this rice paper.
really you do n't fry it.
you just dip in water to get all pliable so you get it at the store like this, and then use hot water to make it soft.
OK was smooth around an.
you got lettuce noodle.
this is traditional with shrimp or mom poodle aioli in there at low fat in there, and that 's really the secret because everything is so lean poured.
this is rice noodle.
you would hydrate from a store that you bye jeff.
why is this one of your favorite, go to dishes to make especially around the holiday?
season is so clean and simple.
the sauce got a lot of flavor.
it 's just not overpowering is something, you know, how you like matzo ball.
soup is so clean and simple sort of same thing, the flavor just pure and.
so i got the noodle them in i think what i love about this dish too especially when you 're entertaining as you can get your friends and family in the kitchen, helping you make these i 'm sure when you were little, you would help mom and the kids, this is, where they are free to break it and they just target really hard.
so it 's almost like i 'm making a burrito.
but super, super tight and we put the shrimp up top, face down at several actually see it right then, you just cut it and do n't get fancy do n't were serving with this.
it 's a penis sauce with me, so and chili, and it 's got glutinous right in there to make it creamy.
so without it, you probably just have skippy, and chili, so, no.
i cannot wait to try this.
and i ca n't wait to make this holiday season for my friends.
and family chef, thank you so much.
thank you, thank you for having a church.
