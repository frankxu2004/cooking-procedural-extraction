so i have n't been doing a lot of cooking tutorials here lately because it 's been getting in the summer and summer time.
it 's more about just eating fresh stuff a lot, and not so much.
i get off the meat a lot in this summer and definitely do n't cook a lot of big meals in the summer.
but those german recipes on the, on the site, you know, those seem to be.
so far like the most popular, and i thought i 'm going to make some a hankering for some schnitzel since i did make some.
so i make pork schnitzel.
i do n't even deal at all.
i have n't ate veal since i was a kid.
and i saw some documentary about what they do those pork house.
so , i mean, i know all meats bad but fortunate soul is really good.
you do n't have a screener, schnitzel.
and that 's veal.
what i just use pork.
these work frozen.
i buy a pack.
you have seen him in the grocery store, their boneless pork chops basically first thing i want to do is.
i want to get all i get all the fat off of it i pushed it so and pork chops.
i might leave that sat on there, but for.
not fish mad.
so i do n't want any fat at all on this pencil.
and i 'm even going to cut off this little end piece all the way off, you know, as you.
if you 've ever seen in my videos i have dogs.
so cook that up.
and they 're going to love that OK.
so do the same on here.
now this thing we 're going to pound it, and it 's going to be quite a bit bigger than it is.
right now, OK.
so here i 've got my two pieces batoff, and then you need one of these pounding things you start how i do.
it is i start with the big teeth.
there 's big teeth and small teeth, i start with the big teeth.
one side, the other side, and then what this does.
it just kind of loosens up the fiber of me.
if you start right in with the little one, sometimes it ends up falling apart.
so i do this first, like.
so now i go back at it with the little one.
there 's a thing about sissel is you want it to be pretty much like paper thin.
i just remember i do n't have any fresh lemon, either.
so work that 's, you know, this is what it looks like now, it 's very large and very thin going to do the same with the other one, flip it.
so this should be normally, you know, in like the one more OK.
the reason i did that a little one works i picked it up.
and it felt too sick.
so it should be very thin almost in a little bit thicker than paper OK, so here 's a step.
one next step is we 're going to read it.
and then we 're going to frighten some oil.
and then you serve it with a little lemon butter.
OK , i 'll be back in a bit to show you the breading.
not him back then i 'm on to the next step.
here this is the same breading technique that i use on the porch ass.
if you watch that video, the only difference on this is i do n't add any garlic in this case.
so what i have already i really my little work station setup flower here.
i 'm going to crack an egg.
now if i 'm only making two.
so i 'm not using much.
but you would want to adjust your proportions a little bit north of little bit of milk, and always.
and i 'm writing stuff.
i always just throw in a little shot of soy sauce, too.
i do n't know why i got into that habit.
OK , so i 've got over here.
flower eggnog, tiny dropper soy sauce and then the third step is usually on a normal circumstances would be just season breadcrumbs.
but i 've been doing this mix lately.
and i 'm really liking this mix.
i was forget that you have a dry fork to mix it up.
so i 'm going to add a little bit of season breadcrumbs.
a little bit of that would be italian season, this is wheat, wheat bread.
crumbs whole we playing.
and then panko, panko rocks man tanko is some good stuff.
i mean, it looks kind of funky now.
but it really does given a really nice kind of crunchy texture, snitzel, i mean, i 'm making it was pork when i was in germany, practically every other item.
on the menu, and the restaurants worth little sniffle, sniffle, so they make it all sorts of different ways and different things on it.
i learn how to make it from her.
she was the schnitzel, schnitzel queen.
so shot out to mary ann alright, so here we going to do these two.
i 've got my thinly pounded out pork loin.
i 'm going to get a nice coating of flour.
throw it in the egg do the same with this, just sit in the flower for a second here.
whoops , sometimes in this, you might have to use your fingers.
i 'd try not to, i do n't want all this group on my finger.
that 's gross loud man.
i kids are going up would make two.
i 'd make you know, they would just die for this stuff.
we discovered it up.
there was one of our favorite dinners, we had it probably once a week.
so that 's there, and i 'm going to get this one coated with flower.
see under pork chops.
i also rubbed some garlic on.
but i do n't put the garlic image that soul is that 's how she did n't do it that way.
so i kind of just i pretty much stick to her recipe other than the soy sauce here and the panko mixture thing here i have this on a piece of wax paper, and i give it a coding.
sometimes it helps, loops.
sometimes it helps if you kind of press, press that, breading down on there i find really get it 'cause i like a lot of reading.
this is pretty much, you know, fried breading.
the little bit of meat in there.
so there 's one and i 'm going to do the same with this one and then all it is, is you 're just going to fry it up in a little bit of a little bit of oil, i think she used olive oil on this.
but i 'm not going to.
i 'm going to use canola.
we go get it in there, she can see give it a sprinkle on each side.
i think i have enough here and try to, try to make that work.
i do n't like goofy hands.
so i 've got it on my fingers and stuff.
and then have to really wash my hands out really good.
if you 're going to have to wash your hands out, you know, with anti bacterial soap in the whole, the whole bit, OK.
so i 'm just going to give this a little bald spot there.
get it make sure it 's really coat if, OK, so here we have normally when i was amazing, this had a stack.
this high of bush that sells bad just me.
and this is i 'll probably eat one today and save one, so here it is these are the finished ready to fry.
and then we 're going to move on to the next phase of fry him up, and top with a little butter and lemon.
i did n't get fresh lemon.
so i 'm going to have to maybe use lemon juice, i know.
but i 'll be back to show you the frying process in a few minutes.
OK , so i 've got some oil.
it 's got a couple drops of water in it.
that 's why it 's doing that noise stuff.
so i 'm going to go ahead and get my script solves hard time.
have to get it into the pan as i said.
earlier , i 'm just using canola oil.
i think my ex mother-in-law used to use olive oil you can use whatever you want i think i know love is just better for this kind of thing there 's some things i like i 'll go on but just saying one of 'em.
OK , so i got it in the oil.
i 'm going to crank it, and i 'm just going to run into on both sides.
so just keep an eye on it.
and then when it 's brought on one side you take your fork and flip.
and then it will be around on the other side.
subject , back in a few minutes when it 's completely brown, so here is just a couple minutes later and think this tools are dumb.
this one is definitely on the other ones.
not quite is brown, but that 's OK, because i 'm not going to eat it.
both today, so then this will be when i warm it up.
i 'll probably warm up.
in a toaster oven or something and it will have a.
little , little room to be browned on coming to scoot over here and show you.
too since i 'm not going to eat this one.
today , i 'm just going to not do it, but normally how we always did it was my knife.
soon as it hot out of the fire.
you put a little tab about it on it right away.
and then that melts and then you add fresh lemon.
preferable , but i 'm going to probably have to use some just a bottle of lemon juice, so you have to add butter melt down there.
and then you put a little lemon on it, and it 's boulevard.
i was going to say many feet.
but i better these three men and save under a moon river, OK.
so now, you know, how to make pork schnitzel enjoy.
