welcome to japanese.
cooking one, oh one today.
we are making yaki, udon, yaki do n't need stare fried boudin noodles with meat and vegetables, it 's a quick and easy dish that is great for a weekday supper.
here are the ingredients.
we have some boudin noodles.
we defrosted the frozen kind this time under running water.
but you can also boil the dried noodles for the meat.
we are using pork cut forced air fries for vegetables.
we have carrot green, bell pepper onion and cabbage.
we use vegetable oil for stir frying and salt and soy sauce for seasoning very simple.
first , we prepare the vegetables just cut it up anyway.
you want we cut carrot into things, dicks, and roughly chop cabbage and take some seeds out of the bell pepper and slice thinly, and onion sliced thinly as well.
now heat the pan at medium high heat, and at vegetable oil first, cook the meat.
we like to use pork for flavor.
but you can use any meat.
you want chicken pieces or thinly sliced.
beef would also be great when the meat is cooked at vegetables onion and harder vegetables first.
just simply stir fry in the pan just like making stir fried vegetables at cabbage and continue frying this is a great way to use up any leftover vegetables.
you may have in your refrigerator when the vegetable get slightly wilted at boudin noodles and keeps their frying boudin.
is of course, grating soup.
but these noodles have very nice texture when fried and very filling, after a couple more minutes, we are going to add seasonings just sprinkle?
some salt and soy sauce usually we use very simple seasonings for yuki don, you can also use were sister sauce instead of soy sauce.
if you like more savory flavor, we like to keep it simple.
but still tastes really good.
serve it on the plate, and if you like top it with some bonito flakes for some extra flavor and pickle ginger.
when you want to finish up leftover ingredients in a backup double frigerator and to eat a quick but tasty meal this is the one to try.
