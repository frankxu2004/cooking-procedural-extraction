today , we learn to make her real food with my friend, joyce.
so happy to be here, pretty send an awful yeah.
but for years on young, if you do, well just good and.
so where are we cooking, then we 're going to make a very simple dish.
you can make it like a day in advance, you can make it that day, but, yeah, it 's, yeah, we have like a really nice setup fee here, pretty TC, and this is called prove ogi pull cody were making guys full corgi, what does it mean for books probably, i guess, literally translates to pumis fire anko guy is just meet.
so they are mean, so fire me cook meat.
hook me up with me.
full game people were working with is that easy very, very easy, which is going to dump everything together, wait and then cook it, sure when do we eat this in korea, like, is it for max, or dinner occasions.
it could be for occasions.
but this is the kind of dish that 's just great for, you know, you can eat it even her practice, but usually lunch dinner.
it 's like people make it at home and make it at home, you can go to a restaurant and have it, it 's very just everywhere.
it 's very popular.
korean aspects, i divided by the way, did you guys see my queen input very priority?
this is a gift yes by her side with my friend asking thank you.
actually want to bring another one OK.
so here we have about account of this is tenderloin.
you can use sirloin.
actually , you can use any exactly because you see my face.
it 's just that 's the point you can use any kind of meat.
so thin, that even if it 's a very tough cut, it will still be tender.
because it 's OK, and if you ca n't get it very thin.
that 's OK, because you just marinate it for longer.
maybe we had it in like thin slices not very thin, and then you marinate it.
OK , so, first we 're going to prepare a few ingredients.
this is just one carat.
we 're going to kill it, i mean, that 's easy.
very easy, so we 're just going to take a greater and use the big models wow, nice carrots.
next , we take a small onion and we 're just going to kind of make a puree used by breaking it with the really small holes.
so this is how it 's going to look.
yes , it 's like a puree of onions, basically one more ingredients to prepare the kiwi, kiwi, yeah, guys.
there 's kiwi in this meet.
yes , the kiwi is actually really great for tenderizing the meat.
when you told me this of like really, so they use kiwi to tenderize meat so it 's very soft.
i think it 's a little bit of sugar.
little bit of tartness.
so awesome OK.
so we have our key, we were going to slice it in half.
and this is like an avocado that way we 're going to take out the meat just going to as you remove.
it , with a spoon, yeah, i 'm just taking the skin off and then you have this trick.
right , yeah, we 're just trying to get a little bit, we maybe need like a spoonful two spoonfuls.
so , let 's do the marinade.
first , we have the kiwi.
and some brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic minced sesame E oil.
then , we have some onions that grated.
then , some ginger powder, yeah, he 's a lasting june rock.
yes , in korean food as well, and then you have some salt to taste maybe like pinterest not too much because we have the soy sauce.
this process is very salty.
there 's also just a little bit.
and then the same with pepper.
just a little.
pinch , and then we 're just going to whisk this together, really.
it 's not good at smoke.
great exact gingery and sweet at the same time, all of these flavor go into the meat and just make it super, super.
so now, we add the vegetables carrots.
we created the green onion, and you got like this funky mushroom look at this shit, talking mushrooms.
ship , captain mushrooms, funky mushrooms, but you can use any mushroom that you have or if you do n't have mushrooms.
you just do n't have to put them in is going to mix it all together we 're going to throw in the meat as.
and look up and we 're just crank.
it altogether moroccans bad hand mixing just to make sure.
the marinade gets all over the meat and everything is really well coded.
well , that looks pretty well, mix so that 's good.
so we just marinated in the fridge.
yes , you can do it in the fridge for like thirty minutes to a day that you do n't have to worry about internet for very long.
so you can do thirty minutes, or you can make it the night before and then cooking for dinner the next day.
i 'm sure that 's a perfect like easy dinner, even freezer and then cook it.
michael month, later, you can freeze it too.
and put it later.
OK , now we put in the fish and then we cook it later.
so this is what we have here after what 's it been like thirty minutes, thirty minutes.
we marinated it for thirteen yummy, you can see some of the sauce and started to kind of gather, and that 's going to be really means is like it changed colors, and it looks a little bit the spices in it up.
drink up some of that marinade.
yeah , so we, cookie found heat up skirts, and it 's very quick very thinly.
slice , so it 's not going to take very long.
do that OK?
so we 're just heating up the skillet throwing in some vegetable oil, and then in goes the pru, kogi.
this killing has to be hot.
right , yeah, you want it to be fiddling yummy and this cooks very quickly, so you do n't have to really worry about overcrowding.
move it around everything cooked so you can see that it 's cooking really quickly and almost done and this juice here.
you do n't want to drain any of that, that 's like a sauce keeps out of the juice here.
and when you put that on rice, the rice soaks in those juices, and it 's the flavor is just amazing.
yeah , this is basically ready, but it 's like two minutes, right.
it 's very, very quick.
and you do n't want to overcook it because then the meat is going to turn top.
so we 're just going to transfer this to a serving dish it smells amazing.
it only took like two or three minutes to cook this query class.
so in korea, we just take a little bit of lettuce and put in some of the meat.
so we have this like, yes, korean sauce.
