hi , i 'm anoop NFL coming to sanjeev, kapoor, cortana and a warm welcome to a series of cooking for beginners now.
let 's make a very basic chicken curry, chicken curry is something that can be made in so many ways every region has its own peculiar.
recipe this one is a basic recipe made all over india and there is no specific name to this is just plain simple chicken curry, and i 'm sure you 'll love this recipe.
so let 's quickly see what all we need to make this basic chicken curry we need.
chicken pieces, which are cut on the bone grated onion fresh tomato puree, oil salt chopped coriander, leaves red chili powder.
turmeric powder, cumin powder garam, masala powder, garlic paste ginger paste coriander powder cinnamon, stick green cardamom, cloves.
so let me first explain to you.
what is an indian chicken curry indian chicken curry is quite high in seasonings in spices.
so there are a lot of things that actually attribute chicken curry, hit preparation now?
what happens is that we use some fresh ingredients and we use some powdered whole spices.
so i 'll just explain to you in case of fresh ingredients.
i have onion and tomato, which is going to be my base of the gravy but to make this even more tasty.
i 'm going to be adding some whole spices and some powdered spices so primarily.
i 'm going to be using onion, onion here is grated.
why grated because that is the easiest way to process an onion.
you rate is even easier but since we 're using pureed tomatoes, we need not use pureed.
onions cause you need that little bite, or you need that little chunk in the chicken curry so onions.
we have grated and tomatoes we have used.
nice bright red ripe tomatoes, which we have pureed, puree is very simple.
just cut the tomatoes and cut the eye of the tomato further cut it into two to three pieces and blend it in the mix.
see , so you have this tomato puree.
and you have the onions.
so , first of all will force, take oil, then i prefer to work in a non stick.
pan becaus it really saves, the efforts, and secondly nothing really sticks to the bottom of the pan.
so you not really worried about their chicken curry or any other preparation getting bond unless you really leave it in the pan for hours and forgot totally about it nothing, like this is going to happen here, so, once you add oil to this will add some whole spices in whole spices will be using.
cinnamon , cloves, and green cardamom, indian preparations or indian curry 's are full with whole spices, as well.
and these ingredients import a lot of flavor today.
but you do n't need to add lots of it.
maybe a small piece of cinnamon green cardamom and some clothes.
so as you add this to the oil automatically get a very nice aroma and this will be there in the curry all the while.
so it 's very important to add whole spices.
and then there is something that is known as garam, masala powder, which is a powder or a masala, which is made by grinding whole spices.
not just these three a lot of other and their lightly roasted, and then they 're powder.
so this is a grammostola which is generally used in all indian preparations across india.
so after you added, the whole spices add onion, now.
what happens is after you great onion, it kind of leaves water like this, so try and squeeze out the excess water cause.
if there is water in the onion, which means it will take awhile to brown, and in the chicken curry, you need nice brown onions.
so just squeeze out this excess water like this.
so when you squeeze out this water browning happens faster, and you added to this oil, and you start sorting this till the onion starts browning now, sometimes what happens is while fourteen jewel observed that the oil has already got absorbed by the onion.
because initially we had not added a lot of oil, you can easily go on and on with this much oil, as well, if you are quite calorie, conscious, if you think you can easily carry it off by adding some more oil.
you could add it, your or in this case, if you want to make it with very less oil, you have to keep on sorting this in starts browning once onion starts browning we will add the other ingredients all the other spices should n't be added before the onion browns.
because once you 've added everything else onion will not brown, it will only stay white, but since we want the onion to brown, we will not add anything.
right now what is basically browning of onion, onion has got a lot of sugar and when it comes in contact with heat like this.
it 's caramelize is, and, that is why braun onions always stays street.
since the sugar has got caramelized sweet, and it also turns golden brown.
so , that is a very simple logic behind browning of onions.
and , of course, it also gives a very good flavor to the curry.
most of the beriani, suc have per brown onions.
garnish is only be cause it gives good look at the same time.
it also tastes nice.
and in case of chicken curry we have to brown the onion because in case of onions like this it stays quite raw.
it does n't give a good mouth feel.
so , once you brown the onions, it 's combined with all the gravy, and it does n't separate from the gravy.
you 'll always notice if onions are left raw, as in if they 're not really sauteed, well, they will always separate 's, and you have a tomato gray on one side, and you have the onions on one side.
so it is always important to sort out the onions to an extent that it starts browning OK.
so you see the onion has already started browning now is the time to add other spices.
will first start off with ginger garlic paste?
after you add ginger, garlic paste will now add turmeric powder real address.
chili powder, actually powder, would depend upon the kind of spicy food, you eat at home will add some khuman powder and some coriander powder.
now after you add the whole spices.
there are chances that it may born.
so you may add very little water and just mix this or is the spiciest.
would have all got burned since there was very little oil that we had used in the masallah?
OK , so now this needs to be sorted for about a minute after you have done this.
we have to now add tomatoes and tomatoes are in pure it form so we have pureed the tomatoes will add all of it.
you 're you see after you add the tomato puree.
the color changes, and it goes ninety cent bright red, i mean, this case if the tomatoes were not read, this would not have looked very good.
it would have given an insipid look and apart from that the red chili powder also that we have uses the kashmiri one, which is not very spicy, and it imparts could color.
so as far as possible try and use kashmiri chili powder and bright red tomatoes.
so this way you will have a very good nice bright red chicken curry now.
after we 've added the tomatoes will now add salt.
there should also be added soon after the tomatoes becaus that way the tomatoes cook faster.
because once we add salt to tomatoes it automatically leaves all the moisture and once all the moisture in the tomato is evaporated.
the tomatoes are done so here.
the actual cooking happens where the tomatoes have to cook as in tomatoes, if they 're left raw, the chicken curry does n't taste too good.
so onion has to brown and tomatoes have to cook well, things if they happen properly.
chicken carries a hit.
so , while you have tomatoes are getting sorted.
you can actually get the flavor of the tomatoes.
we just slightly raw, an after a while once the oil starts separating jewel automatically come to know what i mean by cooking of tomatoes.
so right now we have to sort this for some time till the actual raw flavor of tomato goes off.
so now that the tomato is done you can see.
little , little specks of oil, which is seen on the sides like this.
so which means the tomato has already left and it 's.
now time for us to add the chick in.
so we have chicken.
which we have views on the bone.
so all of this in this after which we 'll add little salt we 've already added some salt who the tomatoes we should keep that in mind and not add excess in that case of chicken curry will go quite salty, and right.
now will add some coriander as well.
cause fresh coriander when you added in the gravy.
it imparts very good flavor.
so , after this, just makes this nicely.
no do n't add any water right now.
because chicken also has a lot of moisture in it and it will also leave all the moisture and giving the curry the required consistency, so just mixed.
is in, like this will add some garam, masala powder yo?
this is available.
most of the grocery stores once again will mix this if needed.
will add water, but that will be towards the end and water whatever that you add to the curry will have to be hot cause?
if you add cold water here.
the gravy will go low and the chicken may go tough so it 's very important to add hot water to any curry, so let 's make this.
well , yeah, that 's perfect and after we have mixed this.
we just going to cover it and let this cook chicken.
curry does n't take very long to cook.
it will take somewhere around twenty minutes and.
so will cover this on medium heat for twenty minutes, and by the end of it chicken curry will be ready, OK.
the chicken also looks cool so all of this looks perfect.
now if you feel the carries thick, which even i feel what we can do is, we adjust it by adding some water.
but after you add water, you have to just give it a boil.
so that it mixes well, and that 's it then do n't further hooker.
because again it is going to take and as far as the car is concerned.
this is done we will garnish this with some more coriander just like this.
and it 's good to go if it 's thick like this, you can serve it with nice parameters, which i 've already shown you, or you can make the simple boiled rice and serve it with that just amazing to have hot chicken, curry and a bowl of plain steamed.
rice make this recipe.
just the way i have made it and you will be very proud of yourself.
