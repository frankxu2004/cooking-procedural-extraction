hey guys, this was a requested video by subscriber.
i 'm going to show you guys how to make korean style spicy pork AKA.
teeboy , typically, we just stir fry it with spice, but i like to boil it first to join the fat out.
so it 's a little bit healthier.
alright , let 's get started.
OK , so i have my port hearon.
i slice it in the middle, so it 's smaller pieces typically.
i do n't like port.
i use chick in so.
if you want you guys can use okie, dokie so we have our green onions an regular onion, i will list the specific measurements down below.
so make sure you guys check that out.
i have hot chili paste low sodium soy sauce.
we have sucky.
this actually eliminates the smell of pork when you cook it.
we have pureed garlic, and then we have hot chili flakes here.
and then you 're going to need a large bowl to mix everything up later on.
then i have my lettuce, which i love to eat my pork.
also , my tofu, which one are boiled so i forgot to mention this earlier, but we do need another large bowl to make our hot chili paste.
here i am adding ten tablespoons of hot pepper flakes if you guys are sensitive to spice, i would probably use six, or seven, or maybe even five.
but it all varies on the brand that you purchased the brand.
i purchase for this one was extremely hot, and i did n't know about it until after.
but even when i was cooking, the port when i was talking it i knew right away that it was going to be super duper spicy.
OK , so now we 're going to add one tablespoon of hot chili paste to our hot pepper.
flakes now, we have to add five tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce to our bowl.
you guys can use regular soy sauce if you want.
if you guys do n't have low sodium, but i prefer low sodium.
so now just going to mix everything up together, so it 's all blended an evenly distributed.
all right now it 's time for the good part we 're going to be adding two tablespoons of.
saki , to our mixture, OK, so now that our water is boiling.
let 's just add in the.
poor , you drain out the fat, if you guys want to come.
you can repeat this step two take out the extra, extra fat.
but i will do it once only for five minutes 'cause we 're gonna be.
sauteing it later on, anyway, alright.
so , after five minutes we 're going to drain the greasy, greasy nasty water.
and we 're going to rinse the porch with cold water and put it to the cipher of it.
alright next step we 're going to boil our tofu for five minutes, while our tofu is boiling.
we 're going to add.
are pork to a large.
bowl , and add three tablespoons of the chili paste that we made earlier now.
we 're going to need half a tablespoon of sesame E oil.
now we 're going to add one tablespoon of garlic.
now we 're going to need a half a tablespoon of ginger and what i need four tablespoons of brown sugar.
now i 'm adding one whole onion and just mixing everything up.
there 's not really a specific measurement to the black pepper is just up to you.
guys your preference.
so i 'm going to add one teaspoon of bamboo salt las.
finales the green.
onions , i have just three stocks of green onions, but it 's up to you.
guys after we will there, so we 're going to slice them up into little bite size.
pieces , like so OK so we 're almost done i 'm just placing the tofu or on the plate, you guys do n't have to do this.
i just do it because i think it 's pretty.
and then i 'm just going to finish off by topping up some green onions and sprinkling someone tough now it 's time to be.
bauer , this thing, OK, so now i 'm going to use my lettuce and place my work in there and eat it.
like so a lot of koreans use lettuce, and they also eat rice, but i 'm cutting out the rice for tonight.
i 'm just going to eat it with my lettuce.
and my tofu so what you do with the tofu is you just cut it in half into little bite size.
pieces , and then place a piece of meat on top and eat it.
