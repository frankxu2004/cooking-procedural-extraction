now a modern day burger chain known for their delicious burgers and today, we 're going to make the original shake shack burger join us on.
get the dish where we find out the secrets behind signature dishes from famous chest and eateries and show you how to recreate them at home.
shake shack is known to have lines lasting over an hour just to get one of their shack burgers.
the juicy flavorful and cheesy burger.
all starts with the meat.
now we 're using three types of meat for this.
burger , sirloin chuck and brisket now you can get this at your grocery store, and most butchers will grind it for you.
if it 's not already grinded ground sirloin is a leaner cut of meat using standard ground, be and it offers a certain tenderness to the burger ground chuck, which is the most popular comes from the shoulder and neck of the cow.
it has an immense amount of flavor and then.
really , just has this dynamite, big hearty flavor going to give these little mix.
make sure they 're all mixed together.
and then i 'm just going to get right in there with my hands, an form it into a disk you wanted about two inches high and two and a half inches wide it should really kind of mirror a hockey puck, i always use this part for two inches.
so i still gotta keep going.
and , then just flatten the top perfect.
i 'm just going to place this in the fridge and let it set while we toast our buns.
the shake shack uses martin sandwich rolls, now if you ca n't find these, you must use potato rolls their squishy and soft and have a distinct sweetness.
and they 're also the perfect vehicle for soaking up the shake shack sauce.
now i 'm just going to lightly butter each side of the bun.
and then we 're going to toast it until it 's nice and golden brown right into our skillet the secret sauce is really what makes.
this , a shake shack burger, and not just a regular cheeseburger super simple to make into a food processor.
i 'm just going to put our half a cup of mayonnaise.
one tablespoon of ketchup, a tablespoon of yellow mustard, not four slices of kosher dill pickle, a quarter teaspoon.
garlic powder and a quarter teaspoon of paprika and just a little pinch of cayenne pepper.
and then we 're just going to blend this up until it 's nice and smooth there we go that secret sauce.
this is really where the magic happens all right.
let 's take a look at our buns.
oh , yeah, nice and golden brown great now let 's make the burger.
what makes the shake shack burger so different is the hard crunchy crust on the outside of the patty.
this is a special technique that i 'm going to show you.
so i put a little bit of oil in the bottom my skillet and i placed.
it , on a medium high heat, you want to wait until right before it begins to smoke.
and then i 'm going to season are patty with salt and pepper and then i 'm going to place it seasoned side down right into the skillet and then using the back of the.
spatula , i 'm going to press down on the beef puff.
you really want to smash it down.
this is what 's going to help get that night.
thick crust right.
and then the season, this side of the patty with a little bit of salt and pepper when i took this for about two minutes until chris brown, crust is formed.
then we 're going to flip it over and at archies and cook for another minute look at that nice brown crust that 's exactly what we want now going to put our american cheese right on top and then leave.
it , in the skillet for about a minute or until your cheese has melted alright, it 's time to assemble are burger.
so i 'm just going to place this patty with the cheese on to my bottom bun.
now i 'm just going to put this sauce, which i put into a squeeze bottle just going to drizzle it right across just like they do it, shake shack, then i 'm going to put our two slices of ripe.
plum tomato anna, piece of green leafy lettuce.
i 'm in top.
it , with the top bun, oh, yeah, ah, this burger is really something else, i mean, from the crust on the patty and that sweet, sour, slightly hot sauce, i cannot wait to despite into this.
mmm , oh, my god, i feel like i 'm in new york city.
now this is so good.
i can certainly see why people wait hours to get one of these.
