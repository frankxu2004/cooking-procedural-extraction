get everyone and welcome today are making one of my all time favourites, and it is.
so delicious and.
so easy to make at home.
so for starters, you of course need some chicken.
now off, cut up a whole chicken here into pieces you can, of course by the chicken pieces precut, i 've got a couple of drumsticks.
the thighs the wings with half of the breasts attached and the other half of the breasts i 'm using a one kilo chicken for these.
i find that larger chickens take too long to cook.
and the outer coding becomes overcooked.
so stick around the one kilo mark now for the seasoning.
i 've got one cup of plain flour.
one tablespoon of salt a teaspoon of ground, black pepper, about a quarter teaspoon of cayenne pepper now this does n't make it hot.
it just gives it a bit of a kick half a tablespoon of garlic powder, a tablespoon of onion powder a teaspoon of dried mixed herbs.
now for the secret ingredient that will make it super crunchy i 've got some instant potato mash powder.
and i 'm going to add in half a cup of this, give this a good mixed together and it 's time to prepare the chicken.
so here i 'm just taking a piece of chicken and i 'm just going to dip it in some egg wash, which is just a couple of beaten eggs mixed with a little bit of water and then into the flour mix and onto a plate and i 'm going to repeat this for all of the chicken pieces and set it to one side for twenty minutes, and then it 's time to do it again.
so into the egg, wash back into the flower and what this does is it gives it a lovely thick coating and this will help make that chicken super crunchy.
so can just repeat this for all of the chicken leave it one side for twenty minutes before cooking and it 's time to fry it.
so here i 've got some canola oil preheated to one eighty celsius or three fifty fahrenheit, and i 'm just going to gently place in half of those chicken pieces you do n't want to overcrowd your oil here, and i 'm going to cook this for fifteen minutes, turning it every three to four minutes and this will ensure the chickens cooked nice and evenly, and once it 's done i 'm going to remove it from the fryer and place it onto a rack to remove any excess oil and just repeat this step for the rest of your chicken and this is what you get guys be sure to leave it for about ten minutes or.
so before digging in so, you do n't burn your mouth and enjoy.
now this recipes.
so delicious that extra crunch really tops off your standard fried.
