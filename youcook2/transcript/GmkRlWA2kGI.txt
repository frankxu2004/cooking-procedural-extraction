hi guys, this is my new kitchen.
so i 'm really excited here and welcome to my youtube channel, and today, making a very yummy dish.
it 's called beef goulash.
it 's an eastern european dish, but originally comes from hungary.
i 'll show you very easy way to make it, an.
i hope you press all your family friends, partners and so on, so we 're going to be needing four hundred grams of beef cut into slices.
i 've got here two tablespoons of flour, one teaspoon of paprika, one tablespoon of tomato puree, half of pepper, you can use red or green.
i 've got two baileys.
one onion, two cloves of garlic, then here we 've got about three hundred meters of beef stock, two hundred grams of can tomatoes, which is about half a can, i 'm using hundred milliliters of red wine, any cheap one.
so pepper cram fresh or sour cream two carrots and about four hundred grams of baby or new potatoes i get first of all, we 're going to brown on beef.
so prepared my pan, heated up.
now it 's very hot and we 're going to brown the beef until it 's very, very dark in color and then take it off your pants.
you should really hope once you go color on all sides just take it out, OK.
so , once the steak is cooked from all sides and do n't leave it to overcook.
because it 's going to become really chewy and we want me to be varisoft, just take it out into plate and put it aside this smells.
the whole house smells like absolutely amazing, you can see it 's been simmering for about one and a half hours.
it became like a solid liquid source.
now we 're going to do.
we 're going to add, are potatoes and let it cook for another half an hour?
and then this ready to go.
just makes those in.
i 'm really hungry.
i ca n't wait to try this.
i 'm before you put salt and pepper taste a little bit, see how much you need.
because usually all the flavors from vegetables and the medes and obviously the red wine source.
it 's very, very salty already from natural sugars.
so just add a little bit tried and let it simmer for more.
it 's all done look at this, all we got is amazing, really hungry.
