hey guys, i 'm april mckinney.
and i 'm excited today to show you a recipe for general sows chicken.
you probably seen this on many of the chinese take out restaurants on almost every menu of those restaurants, ann usually it 's deep fried then tossed in a really thick survey sauce.
it tastes really good.
but it 's not very good for you, so i came up with the recipe.
that 's a lot lighter, but it still tastes great.
it 's really easy.
and this is one of those recipes.
i think all the recipes that i, that i do for videos are good video.
but this is one that i really felt good about as soon as aiden, i thought OK, this is a home run.
so if you do n't try any recipes need to try this links.
i think it really like it.
so now i 'm going to mix up the sauce and what i wanna start with is actually a quarter cup of low sodium chicken broth or stock, either one works and if you did n't have chicken stock, you could use water to replace this and wo n't be quite as flavorful but, it will still work.
the next thing.
i 'm going to do is two tablespoons of rice vinegar and this in the asian section of the ethnic section of the grocery store, or it may be in the vinegar section just depends on what store you 're at.
but really easy to find very inexpensive in a great ingredient for asian cooking.
the next thing is two tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce.
i always use the low sodium because soy sauce has a ton of salt in it.
and i like so i sauce.
so i do n't like to not use very much this way.
i can still use two tablespoons and not worry too much about the salt content.
the next thing i have is a tablespoon of brown sugar, and this is just going to add a little bit of sweetness because you 're most asian.
food does have a little bit of sweetness and a hot nishana, sourness.
it 's kind of got all these different flavor components so we do need a little bit of that in the ground.
sugar is going to be great because it 's got a really rich flavor.
more than just a white sugar would.
so we do n't have to use quite as much the other thing i 'm going to do is, i have got two cloves of garlic that messed up just going to put those right in here going to add a lot of flavor and.
now a pinch of red pepper flakes, probably about an eighth to a quarter of a teaspoon pens on how spicy.
you like it, general sows chicken is usually sort of spicy.
so i like to do about a quarter teaspoon of the red pepper flakes and the next thing is kind of an interesting ingredient.
this is actually fresh ginger.
it 's ground up normally with like a jar of garlic or something i do n't really recommend using those 'cause they do n't taste as fresh.
but for ginger, because i only use it really rarely usually have used a little piece of it and then end up throwing the whole thing away indiana.
still taste pretty good.
so i 'm going to do about two teaspoons of this ground, ginger pleasantville, a lot easier to use this then to peel, and mens up ginger.
so , let 's just get this twist up.
and this is really our sauce.
the only thing i 'm gonna add.
is about half of these scallions the rest?
i 'm just going to use her garnish on top of the chicken, and that 's perfect.
it 's easy as that really simple easy to find ingredients so that parts done.
the next thing we want to do is word.
obviously , we 're not going to deep friends.
you 're probably see probably anything deep, fried on my recipes so what i am going to do though is.
i 'm still going to give it a little bit of a crust and it 's going to be really easy what i have is a cup of regular all purpose flour.
i 've got a pound and a half of chicken breasts here.
and you could see the size there, about maybe a half inch cubes of chicken that i just cut up if i can get these in her about spelling am there.
we go perfect now.
this field is up.
i love to use the black bags for this kind of thing, you can just throw it away.
you have to worry about cleaning it.
and then you just going to give this shape alright each of these are coded with a little bit of the flower.
now , and so what i 'm going to do is head on over to the stove and i 'll show you how to put this.
all together all right so here i have a large skillet.
i 've got a tablespoon of canola oil that has been heated up.
it 's over medium high heat.
i really want this skillet to be nice and hot because i want to get the sizzle.
i want to make sure that, that flower gets nice and brown.
so we want to have that fried effect on this chicken, even though we 're obviously not frying , it.
and it is going to be a lot healthier than other versions as you can see.
i 'm sort of certain attorneys over one is just to have a slight golden color.
but like that, that little gold color and then you can turn it right over on the other side OK, these ones perfect, they 've got the nice color to him on all sides.
it really sort of forms a nice crust that is going to make this taste like the real thing.
just take those right out and then will add in our sauce.
and i 'm actually going to cook it for about a minute or.
so just to kind of get it heated up and let the garlics off in a little bit.
and then we 'll add back in the chicken sauce.
now let 's get the chicken back in, and what i 'm going to do is just begin to toss this around, and that soft is going to thicken.
because the flower will put on the outside of the chick in, we do n't have to use car cornstarch or anything.
because the flower is going to thicken up that sauce.
and i 'm just going to toss it around , well.
it 's on about medium heat until everything is coded and all the chicken is cooked.
three alright are general sows, chicken is done.
so i 'm just going to put it in this little serving dish and that looks fantastic looks great.
and you looking at that you would think this is not a very healthy data.
but it is really light in a promise, you it tastes fantastic almost as good as stuff in the restaurant and really it takes better to me.
because you know, you 're not eating just complete crap.
you 're eating something that 's really good for you.
so i 'm going to sprinkle these scallions that i reserved right over the top to make it look pretty just like they do with the restaurant.
this is something fun to do.
you can make this, you see.
it 's really quick to do you could serve with some brown rice and maybe some seemed broccoli, or snap peas.
and you 've got just a chinese meal that 's really healthy and easy to do it.
you can feel great about so.
i have got to get a taste of this.
i cannot wait any longer love the stuff.
true is a little spicy.
turns a little sweet and certainly does n't taste like it 's healthy so, i think you 're really going to like this give it a try and join and it 's spelled T , S.
oh , so if you like me, you probably gone through a lot of variations of how you say it.
sometimes i use a general sows with a T in front, sometimes general sounds i 've just gone all through the vocabulary with this work.
but it is actually general sows no team the TS silent.
so just a little tip for you.
next time you order it.
