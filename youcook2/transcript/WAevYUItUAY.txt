hi , i 'm larry.
this is total outdoor programming and today.
we 're going to talk about grilling another one of my really favorite things to grill is brought worse, if like me, there are times that you do n't think far enough ahead and you have to buy frozen brought worst again the bun warmer is perfect put your frozen brotz up on the bun warmer close your lid and in about five to eight minutes they will be pretty well, thought, and then you can start cooking him near the fire i never ever put the fire directly.
i used the indirect method because i want them to cook slow and be more flavorful, also turn them off.
and you do n't want them king real, fast and getting burned on the outside.
i believe the most important thing to remember when you cook a brought is not to pierce the skin that will not only cause a flame up in your fire.
but will drive the meat out and make them.
people will say, oh, yes, is a terrible brought?
when it maybe have been a good one especially from one of your local folks who makes them fresh.
and you 'll just have a lot better brought.
do n't break the skin number one do n't use your ford to turn the braatz over use?
the tongs do n't grip them real tightly when you turn them over.
because the talks can break the skin when i 'm cooking brotz.
i will normally closed the lid.
but in a half at a time when i know there safely not near where the fire is.
because that acts more like an oven din and gets the heat around him , quicker.
i think that to make a good bra.
it will usually take fifteen to twenty minutes.
because you want to cook them slowly off, and you can start you brought 's first and then do your hamburgers or hot dogs after that, if you 're doing a mixed grill for a family gathering brought worse or pork products who want to remember they need to be cooked to one hundred sixty five degree internal temperature have a meat thermometer to check them with when i 'm going to server brought i do n't use hot dog buns, i use broad front gets a big piece of meat put it on a big bun.
i use again.
i love mustard and onions and then i try to have cast iron skillet that i use and i 'll fry sauerkraut right in esculent over the flame, while the brazzer cooking in and out put sauerkraut on my brother.
this has been total outdoor programming.
keep on grill and, and it 'll get better and better all the time.
