let 's prepare some salmon sashimi.
this salmon is being bought from a supermarket.
i always choose sam and that is got along sell by date on it.
then , you know, what you 've got the freshest if that means reaching to the back of the shelves in the chill cabinet boy not lovely, fresh, he should smell the fresh of the sea, should n't smell of fish?
so this is how we do it first of all, we cut and try to do it in one stroke along that way again there.
so what i try to do is cut and avoid the darker piece of meat there and then take the cut the longer skin in long strokes by that one set and then start a little bit higher there and then bring it down and then in hold the salmon together and in long, the strokes there they have a nicely laid out salmon sushi, reset and he would serve that literally by displaying them on this side, slightly separating them like that anyway that range those on a knife plate with some diakon, radish grated.
then that 's it salmon sashimi.
