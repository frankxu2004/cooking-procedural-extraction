i 'm claire harrison, cuvees development chef, today.
i 'm going to show you how to make perfect mash.
so here we have some potatoes.
these potatoes are bought specifically form mashing their am R phone are potato.
but there are lots of other varieties, you can use we start by giving the potatoes a thorough, thorough wash.
it 's very important when using dirty potatoes that you really do wash them and wash all the surfaces that the potato come into contact with, OK, we 're going to peel the potatoes, then i 'm going to cut them into not too small chunks.
because it 'll take on too much water.
but government quarters.
it 's about that size.
all evenly size.
so that all cook at the same rate we 're going to pop them in japan at cold water.
so salt with a little bit of salt will have to taste and adjust the seasoning when we 're making the mash.
but always, put them in salted water.
have them and bring them to the ball very, very slowly until, until the bubbles just break the surface?
and then we simmer very gently until they 're just tender for every day, eating i would put a very small number of butter in and a little bit of warm milk.
but today, i think are feeling indulgence.
so we 're going to add a lot more butter a little bit of double cream and some whole milk, and of course, salt, and pepper.
so we 're going to have a look and see if these are cooked.
and easiest ways to get a knife and just put the point of the night in the potato and it should go in very easily which it does drain them thoroughly two flash, then put them back in the pan and then we just going to put the lid back on, and leave them there for a couple of minutes in the mean time.
i 'm going to take this milk.
i 'm going to heat this milk up.
it 's absolutely essential that the milk is the same temperature as the potatoes when you add it at the wise.
it makes the starch go cold.
and it gives you lumps in your mashed potato.
so what are hot milk care boiling milk here, and our potatoes.
now they 've really dried out beautifully.
take our potatoes will fill press over it goes this is the gadget.
i prefer it 's called a potato press.
it makes a great smooth mash.
so we put some potato in and then an op of your better squeeze it through.
and so it starts to incorporate in with your mashed potato at last couple of seconds where you put the lid on, and leave the potatoes to dry out.
really important is hit in here that they 're really dry and fluffy another novel flutter, remember, this is a special treat mash.
it 's not for every day.
this is not direct match, and with our trusty wooden spoon, start just too ruled potato together.
it almost looks like so much like pulling doubt together little bit of milk.
it 's a light meter little bit, and with a spoon double cream actually to make a really indulgent mashed potato add clotted cream it 's heaven.
tiny bit of luck path not too much.
because we do n't it to overpower, play for the potato lyrics pop it in a fish, give us a little bit of color.
i 'm going to chop few chives, which go very well, with mashed potato.
