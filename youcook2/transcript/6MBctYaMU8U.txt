how you guys say decided to tackle this pot sticker recipe.
a little, once, one papers totally wrong.
this took me forever to make i definitely recommend, buying it.
so i 'm going to start making the little one time sheets or paper will need some flour, and a cup of hot water.
and you also mean like age of salt, and we 're just going to make this together until it makes like kind of a big lumpy little ball.
and we 're going to need it for about five to ten minutes.
i just dusted my work surface with little bit of flowers, so it does n't steak.
and we 're just going to do this until kind of more of a smooth ball.
after you get it into a more smoother sheep or just going to cut it in half and then make little donut holes or just like a donut shape with the dough.
and we 're going to let that rest and put that to the side.
and i see it being such a difficulty making this donut.
but it was just, it was some experience to make like these little, make your own little longtime papers.
but definitely like i said, by your own.
because this took me like these two hours to do like the whole thing hours of leave.
so i 'm finished making my doing it, and i 'm just gonna play some surround rap over it and let it rest.
and then we 're going to work on the meat selling, which is going to be pork, and i 'm just going to add minced garlic to this, and also i try to put the garlic or the sorry.
the ginger in there, too, but it was kind of a struggle.
i was just too lazy to cut it.
so i thought i could just put it in this thing.
but , i mean, a little bit came also is fine, then i have a baby.
and i just have a few of the leaves, and i 'm just going to chop this up really finely and just add it to the meat mixture.
and then i 'm just going to add some green onions that already have chopped now.
i 'm just going to add the flavorings and things.
i think this is the system the oil bug tablespoon, and also adding baking powder in.
i think cornstarch i will list the recipe below for you guys.
and i have these salt, and pepper also adding some sugar, they have some soy sauce, and it also added some rice vinegar as well, to this and a little bit of water and we 're just going to stir this in one direction until everything is combined an looks kind of peace, like, like the meat will start changing its texture, and in just a sack, OK.
so i 'm just going to dust my surface with flour.
and we 're just going to start dividing these up, and i believe it makes about and own.
it makes about sixteen pieces so i had like two.
and i 'm just going to cut them like so hey, on to the fun car, i did n't have a rolling pin.
so , just used a cup instead of by all means if you have rolling pin definitely use that.
and we 're just going to get this like almost as thin as possible.
because we are going to kind of fry them and also steam them, and we do n't want to have it too thick.
so they will like taste like a super gummy tasting.
now for the fun part, is to start filling them?
i was very, dinners with the first few, but typically just build enough for it to not be that much where it 's going to be overflowing.
and i 'm just going to pinch this and make it into a squiggly line kind of pattern, and we 're just going to pinch the end.
so nothing will fall out.
and it took me awhile to get the hang of it.
i mean, my first couple of times will print a janky.
but , i mean, all it 's going to look really nice when you put them together.
so i 'm just going to start making helpful for you guys to see.
here , the dumpling that i finished i actually had extra of the paper wontons.
but i guess that was really generous with the meeting with a lot of them.
and so, these are the finished ones.
and now it 's time to fry them up.
so i took about it tablespoon of the coconut oil, and it 's good to have like the layer of oil on the bottom, and i 'm just going to start filling up the pen with the pot sticker dumplings.
and we 're just going to make the bottom of these golden brown.
is to that level.
we 're just going to add some water to it and then place it over, were delayed.
so it can steam.
but the crying time is probably like five ten minutes on high heat.
we just like i said once the bottoms to be golden from some.
here you 'll see, i added the water in his bubbling just bit under covering it up.
maybe like half away or not, even an then i just put my lid and just let this cook a little bit longer until everything is nicely done.
so , once you get this desire consistency, we 're just going to play this up and you see the bottom is like a golden brown texture.
so , once you have them cleaned it up.
i 'm just going to just a little bit of these sesame seed oil and talk about play some green onions, and you can also do sesame E seeds as well, or just use whatever you like as your taste preference.
and then i 'm also going to make a chili sauce which is some ace with soy sauce and amusing me light sodium.
one and then you guys have it.
i hope you guys enjoy it and try this things watching.
