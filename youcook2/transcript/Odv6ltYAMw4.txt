in this video, i 'm going to show you how to make it very, very, very simple.
five , ingredient if you include, salt and pepper hummus dip to my food processor i 'm going to add a can of garbanzo beans or chickpeas next time.
it had a whole bowl of roasted garlic.
now all i did this is the green garlic that i got from my CSA, so it 's not as strong.
at least i do n't think as regular garlic, all i did is wrapped in some tin foil through it in the oven, cooked it for about an hour.
and then this does n't gush as well as some of the other, but what you can do with roasted garlic is.
you just squeeze it and it comes out as a paste again.
i do n't think it 's a strong, so i 'm actually going to use two bulbs of it now.
i 'm going to salt and pepper.
it just to taste and add some olive oil.
i 'm probably going to end up adding more, thanks our texture looks.
so you could do this in a blender wherever key would n't go until you get the texture that you want probably going to add a little bit more.
may i add a little more olive oil, but here 's the texture that i 'm working with right now taste it?
see if it needs anything else.
that 's pretty good.
is it super simple?
right makes a great, great dip and here, is the finished product you could add roasted bell peppers or really?
anything you like to your.
hummus , but this is just a very simple, roasted, garlic recipe.
if you have any questions let me know.
otherwise , i hope you enjoy.
