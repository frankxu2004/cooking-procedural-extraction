i ca n't think of a better example of the french influence in vietnamese food.
then the bond me sandwich thin crusted, baguette, braised meats, pickled vegetables, fresh herbs all in one sandwich in this video, i 'm going to show you on my favorite bond me, with sweet and savory red cooked pork.
the first step for this bond.
me is to make red cooked pork.
this is the southern chinese technique of cooking pork in soy sauce and spices.
we have a one pound.
piece of pork shoulder cut into two pieces dark soy sauce light soy sauce.
these are really the ingredients that give it the color.
hence the term red cooking chinese rice wine, two sticks of cinnamon and some star anise three pieces lastly, i 'm going to add enough water just to cover the pork after that, all, i need to do is, bring up to a boil as it comes up to a boil.
i want to make sure that the pork is submerged if it is n't, i 'll just add a little bit of water to make sure it is covered.
then i want to skim off any of the phone, then we 'll lower this to a simmer for about an hour until it 's nearly tender.
one other element of the sandwich that needs a little advance prep as our carrot and icon pickles.
no need to cook him really simple to make first thing.
i 'm going to start with is playing all distilled vinegar.
a half cup of that in a half cup of granulated sugar, half teaspoon of kosher salt.
the list that a bit you really do n't need to whisk it until it 's dissolved the next.
i 'll add my carrot and diakon the carrot and icon.
julian could be cut by hand or with a mandolin.
i just need to give it a stir.
now , after these are stirred, i like to marinate them for at least thirty minutes.
but really no longer than twenty four hours if you see there 's still some granulated sugar just come back and start in about twenty minutes.
and it 'll be fine after the pork been simmering an hour.
i want to test for done this what i like to do is give it a little push it to be firm.
but it should be able to be peeled back a little bit.
now that check that it 's tender , enough.
i 'm going to add my sugar.
i want to cool it in the liquid.
so it stays moist and succulent, then going to add six tablespoons of the pork simmering liquid to the measuring cup, two tablespoons of fish sauce.
we use that to season the sandwich at the very end.
now the carrots.
and i kind of picked up that pickling mixture.
i 'm going to drain them get rid of most of the liquid few drops is OK, it actually seasons a sandwich now, the meat school.
let 's slice it get it ready for the sandwich.
take that slice into thin strips.
you can see it 's got that red hue on the outside from the soy sauce, inside is cooked through.
so now i 've got everything ready.
let 's make the sandwich starting with a light thin crusted bag, it a slice, it in half lengthwise leading the spying intact first thing, some mayonnaise.
the mayonnaise i tend to spread on the top half.
OK second is my patio.
the patio i did add some butter too.
so it was spreadable, so it 's nice and soft that goes on the bottom now.
this , i 'm making one sandwich here.
the recipe makes two and i 'll make one there.
we have it, so gotta mayo or patte next i 'm gonna add my lettuce leaves any.
sandwiches do n't have alot of filling.
i took the tip of the green leaf lettuce, and pulled those off in here.
next the pickled vegetables, which have been drained with most of their liquid that comes down the center.
really a seasoning in here cucumbers less of the cucumber than the julian vegetables.
the pickled ones the shave scallions, very light with the scallions springs of cilantro.
the whole spriggs not just the leaves, some of the tender stems are fine.
jalapeno slices any chili will do, those are evenly distributed so we get no really spicy bites and then.
lastly , the pork place that in here single layer and spread them out make sure to fill up the whole sandwich with that fill in any gaps and lastly.
i 'm going to add a sprinkling of the simmering mixture, which is in mixed with the fish sauce.
i want to use four tablespoons of that.
the sandwiches complete as it is.
but if you can find it, pork floss, as it 's called, which is cooked pork, which has been pounded and shaved and sometimes fried.
it 's a great accompaniment to it.
salty roasted in flavor and a little bit crispy.
so now that the first sandwich is assembled let 's cut this and put it on the platter.
and there it is the vietnamese sandwich sweet and salty, spicy crispy everything all in one sandwich.
i 'm saving this last one for me.
everything comes together in one, bites like a party in your mouth.
