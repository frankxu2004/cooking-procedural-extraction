today , i 'm going to share with you.
my favorite pancake made in tips.
we 're going to start by making thick and fluffy, american style pancakes.
and we 're going to need one egg two hundred grams of self raising flour two hundred and fifty milliliters of milk, one teaspoon of baking powder and a tablespoon of sugar makes the flour sugar and baking powder together, i 've also added a pinch of salt, then breaking the egg and give it a good mix.
keep mixing slowly and at the milk.
the mixture should be pretty smooth, but do n't worry.
if there 's a few lumps then cut off another butter and heat it in a pan.
pull any access better into the mixture and whisk it in this will help make the pancakes nice and rich for the mixture into a drug and absent to the pan when you can start seeing air bubbles in the mixture too not over and cook the other side you can serve it with a knob of butter and some maple syrup is a metal cookie cutter to make fun shaped pancakes, and with this gingerbread man cutter, i 'm using blueberries for eyes to make blueberry style pancakes at some blueberries to the mixture and give it a good stern.
then pour some into the pan and cook as normal at some butter or syrup as you like to toss a pancake.
first , you need to make sure it 's cooked on the underside and slides around smoothly in the pan.
then you need to quickly push the pan away from you and flick it with your wrist so the pancake slides up the back of the pan over.
there 's no oil in the pan.
because you do n't want it to splash out and burn you if you have any better leftover you can store it in an empty sauce bottle put the lid on and keep it in the fridge.
the next morning, give it a good shake.
and it 's ready for cooking.
i like to serve my pancakes in a stack and covered in maple syrup to make the thin european style pancakes.
you need to mix half a pint of milk together with an egg, then add a hundred and twenty, five grams of plain flour and a pinch of salt into a bowl.
slowly , at the milk and egg whisk thoroughly and pour the mixture into a drug pete.
some oil in a pan.
and cook a nice big.
pancake , once it 's cooked, you could add lemon and sugar or some fruit.
i 'm going to cover it in a layer of chocolate spread, then slide it between the prongs of a fork and twister fork to roll up the pancake.
cut it in half and serve it with a scoop of ice cream.
