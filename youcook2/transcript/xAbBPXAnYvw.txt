in this video, i 'm going to show you how to make a delicious red meso soup recipe.
so begin with a pot of water about one third full and turn the heat on high as your water is heating up.
go ahead and start with your ginger with the ginger, just peel the skin.
now the trick here is to great your ginger, use this side, which is the almost finest side right here and then just great your ginger.
going to have a low fiber, left just squeeze that right into the water.
here 's the ginger, take all your ginger, put it into the water K.
the next ingredient will be the burdock root, burdock root is very grounding and very good for us.
so you simply peel it, wash the burdock root and then cut up the burdock root cut off the ends slice it down the middle slice.
the middle again notice that the water is boiling that 's good.
let it boil cut up your burdock root into small pieces and add the burdock root to the soup that can boil for a moment or two.
next comes, diakon root, diakon root is a radish.
and it 's also a blood purifier.
simply peel it, and then grate it turn your heat on low and then go ahead and prepare your cal just pull, it off the stem here punch.
it all up and then slice it.
kel is really, really good for you.
lots of vitamins lots of nutrients treat it as often as possible.
next comes broccoli, the next ingredient is the almond butter.
i 'm using a whole foods allman butter.
because it 's the least expensive almond butter and ginger are the two key ingredients to this soup, add a scoop of almond butter, and you have to stir it in the steering in part is very important.
you want it to be dissolved into the water, you should be on either medium or low heat.
right now you 'll notice that the ginger and the burdock root boiled for at least a minute or two.
that 's what you want.
OK , the almond butter stirred in.
now , add all your vegetables as it 's coming back to a boil.
go ahead and take some dulse seaweed and put that into the soup.
i like dole seaweed, the best there are other seaweeds out there in dulles is not the one that 's popular with me.
so soup, however, it dissolves pretty quickly into the soup.
it 's easy to digest its easy to chew, and i think it has a great flavor, miss just starting to boil and.
now we 're going to turn it on very, very low, and we 're going to add the miso paste.
so this is me, so master read me.
so it is my very favorite of all mrs out there.
and i 've tried quite a few.
the one thing that 's particularly unique about this.
me so is that it in comparison to other misos.
it dissolves pretty quickly into the soup, so we 're going to add several scoops to the soup.
here 's what you do not want to do.
you do not want to have your soup boiling while you 're adding the miso paste.
it will hurt the live enzymes in the miso paste, and it will actually taste burned.
so i have it on low, you notice i 'm adding three scoops, and i 'm storing it in it 's probably going to take four scoops.
this is all about two flavor.
the miso paste is what flavors.
the soup now since it 's really hot, i 'm going to turn the heat off the heat is.
now off and the whole idea right.
now is to get the meso paste to dissolve into the soup, which basically means constant, stirring your soup should have a slightly brown color to it, if it 's a light brown, it might be too light.
it might not have enough flavor, you might need to add more meso paste to it, it should have a strong flavor when you taste it.
in fact, i recommend tasting.
your soup, after you 've dissolved the meso paste into it.
i can tell just by looking at it.
that 's going to need a little bit more meso paste.
i 'm going to add a little more and stir it in just keeps during sometimes you 'll find the miso paste in the soup, and you 'll tap it up against the wall to dissolve it.
let 's see, if i can find some there.
we go, so here 's some miso paste.
see it right there, you 're just going to tap it against the wall to dissolve it in taste.
your soup, that 's perfect OK.
go ahead and serve your soup, go ahead and add some flax oil to your soup.
this is bar leans flax oil.
it tastes really good.
and i use it as a condiment, has omega three fatty, acids in it.
this meso soup is excellent that key to making it is the ginger and the almond butter as long as you have the ginger, an the almond butter in the meso paste you will always come up with a great soup no matter what other ingredients you put into it , he.
