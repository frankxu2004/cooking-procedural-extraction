some hotdogs your favorite herbs and spices.
and he also suggested some cheese tomato sauce and mustard, and of course, my suggestion is some butter.
so , the first thing we 're going to do is start cooking these hot dogs.
get on the bad half cooked.
now while those hot dogs of cooking or getting warm at least we 're just going to roll some bread out like this, nice and flat.
we then add some of the herbs and spices of our choice, he reckons.
garlic powder is a must so i 'll definitely put some of that on donut down and add on as well, there might make that one next one.
and then i 'll make this one more.
i want, so i 'm going to just put a bit of mastered an ketchup on just a little bit more spread that out the heck i 'll throw some cheese in there , too.
oh , now we get these half cook sausages and just roll them up like this.
my push them down on the same try and get them to stick and.
some bottom might help it along a bit faster code that braid in the butter and this type thing will also help cook the inside of the sausage, is a bit more, you know, look.
