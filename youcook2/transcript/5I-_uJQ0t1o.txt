hi , this is elia and welcome back to cooking with earlier this year that read through the flavors of morocco as you can see.
we have a new kitchen here.
it 's because i moved to seoul korea, and you can follow all my adventures in cooking with only a program style series with new series out there, however, it does mean that the cooking the videos are going to start.
because we 're going to continue today i 'm going to show you a dish that 's very popular in morocco, especially the north of morocco and explain i 've had it in spain.
i 've had it in seoul korea, when i arrived.
is fried squid, or recall fried calamari, squid apparently is very, very popular in korea, you can find it everywhere, and it 's very cheap?
so basically i got two of these for like three dollars.
it 's really, really cheap.
so i 'm going to show you how to clean this quick how to quit cattin rings and how to fry it more rocket style.
so let 's start first let me show you how to cut this quick.
so here 's my squad here right below the eyes.
i 'm going to cut this portion, and you can see.
there 's something here.
just squeeze it and remove this.
you do n't want this.
you do n't need it.
this is basically the squid, beak.
so this code is like a bird.
it has a big C, so we 're throwing this, and we 're keeping these tentacles.
but with the tentacles do you see these little things here if you touch them.
there like, actually plasticky.
so you want to scrape these off like this, skip them a little scrape and legal.
you can also just do it with your hands can go like this, and they, they removed.
so now that the tentacle are clean, i 'm just going to keep them here.
so we use them here, you have the heads.
i would just pulled ahead and pull everything that comes with it.
so i pulled ahead for go to throw it, and then you will see things that are inside is kind of disgusting.
but anyway just take it away.
so all this.
you do n't want and it also has cartilage.
you 're going to feel cartilage here, so just pull it kind of comes easy.
see all this cartilage here coming up, OK now.
and we clean the inside.
you see, the wings.
these two wings here.
i 'm just going to cut them since i want to cut it into rexanne along the wings and here just came out.
we have been waiting here finally.
the question is to peel or not to appeal.
i want to peel.
it 's more tender.
when you peel the squid social life right so for peeling just find the place where the skin is ripped, and you kind of feel it like an onion.
kind of easy just like pull.
this came this way see so see.
you just pull it keep pulling it till like you take it out.
so here my squid is ready, i mean, if not all that 's going to go away.
but most of the skin is out an all we have to do is clean it in a little bit of water like this.
everything is inside is clean lyrics.
one last piece of cartilage, so make sure everything is clean, and, that is very, very soft.
so there 's no cartilage you can move it around like this.
it 's fine, and all i have to do now is cut it in rings like this, right.
and that 's what we 're going to better enterprise, and here my script is ready.
the calamari is ready as you can see.
we have our calamari rings here.
and now here comes the trick, i 'm going to solve them in milk and try to solve them for at least half an hour.
if you can keep them there for a couple of hours, it 's even better.
but at least half an hour.
because it 's going to make them really tender another trick that people do in morocco.
is they put them in order mess, which is basically club soda?
i 've never tried to club soda, one but the milk works so.
hey , feel free to use the cluster as well.
that 's it you cover it, and then you let it soak in the milk for at least half an hour in the fridge, and then we 're going to fry them define the kalamaris.
we first need to cover them with flour.
so here i just have all purpose flour.
i 'm going to use a little bit of salt and pepper just keep it simple.
and then can mix it together, if you want to have a more flavors in your calamari, you can use powdered garlic or dried herbs or whatever you like.
analyze them to be simple or the little bit of fleming, an escape.
so now we 're ready to start frying first remove the calamari rings from the milk then in paper towel, and we 're going to basically take away all the moist 's like this.
we 're going to put them in the flower just like this until their coverage with flower.
make sure to desktop the excess flour like this.
shape them a little bit.
this way you do n't have this like clumps of flour when you fry them heat vegetable oil in your pen, and it has to be really hot before we start frying, and the way you test this, is it has to sizzle when you touch it with one of the calamari, see this is ready.
this is, this is good.
you just get as well, it goes really quick.
when the oil is hot, you have to reduce the temperature so it does n't splash.
then , keep crying then so this one is good.
it test have to be like golden and that 's all you need place, a calamari rings on a place, covered with paper towels with absorbs in excess oil.
and that 's it 's.
so couple of secrets make sure that oil is the hottest make sure it covers the calamari and do n't code that too much with flower otherwise it again, like this thick, coating this is.
so much better and believe me.
it 's so tasty.
you do n't have to believe me, i 'm going to try to right now, so you serve it immediately high with a little bit of lemon.
you squeeze a little lemon over young.
put a little bit of often better on top if you want.
and this app, all done see how fast this is delicious.
it reminds me when i 'm in morocco.
we go to the beach and come home and then we find this weekend for us for lunch.
so this is not much today.
next time when i 'm busy.
