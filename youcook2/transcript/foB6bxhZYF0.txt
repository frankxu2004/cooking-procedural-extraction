blow , this is chef john from food wishes.
dot com with falafel that 's right fluffles.
one of those rare foods like french fries and pizza that pretty much everybody loves.
in fact, when i meet someone that does n't like falafel i have to admit.
i 'm a little suspicious, i mean, what 's not to like about this crispy deep fried chickpea, fritter and well, i do n't think there 's much danger in this video put in your friendly local neighborhood, falafel stand out of business.
this really did come out quite well, and i think you 're going to be surprised how easy it is.
so let 's go ahead and get started with the star of the show, cool beans also known as chickpeas, or is my family called him grown up.
cici beans, and for the amount i make it.
i 'm going to use one at generous cup of dried garbanzo beans and check him out.
they have a very cool appearance.
they look like little shriveled up, let 's say brains, and what we need to do is soak these before we use them.
so pro tip, if you want to make this today, make sure you do this step yesterday, right.
because what we need to do is cover these in cold water and let them soak at least overnight.
personally , i think twenty four hours is better, but overnight, should be fine?
so like i said, will cover those with a few inches of cold water place where there 's a pretty good chance it wo n't get knocked over, and as long as you 've covered those with enough water.
the next day they should look something like this, and then what will do at this point is drain those very, very well, before we transfer that into our food processor in add the rest of the ingredients are to blender will work.
sort of OK, and yes.
you can make this by hand by crushing their chopping, but that 's going to take significantly longer so try to find a food processor.
i guarantee one of your married friends.
one , just borrow it for a day.
tell you going to make it worth their while with falafel, but anyway, we 're going to go ahead and dump in are now very, well drained beans.
add some diced onion.
and by the way, even though this is going to get processed.
i think it makes more evenly if you start by cutting the onion.
nice and small first so add in about half an onion along with a whole bunch of minced garlic.
we 're also going to need a whole bunch of freshly chopped italian parsley.
some people also like to use cilantro here, or a combination.
we 're also going to need some salt as well as some freshly ground, black pepper.
we 're also going to throw in a spoon of ground cumin or cumin is.
i believe it supposed to be pronounced as well as a little bit of ground coriander.
and then we 're going to shock the world by putting in a little pinch of cayenne as well as a small touch of baking soda.
not powder baking soda anna spoon a flower just a little not too much, OK, one of the big decisions with a falafel mix is.
do you want it more bready or more beanie?
and i prefer beanie.
so , personally i want to put too much flour here, and last.
but not least, we 're going to squeeze in a little bit of lemon juice, and that 's pretty much it and do you need to give it a mix like this, before you process it probably not.
i 'm not sure why did that.
but it 's too late now, but anyway once all your ingredients are together.
we 're simply going to process this pulsing on and off to start.
of course what we want to end up with hear something that 's pretty finely ground.
but not a puree alright we do n't want to liquefy this or turn it into a really fine paste, and with something like this it 's always a great idea about halfway through to take a little break.
take off the lid, take a spatula kind of scrape.
everything down off the sides give a little mix in case.
there are any large rogue chunks refusing to get mixed in.
so i did that and recommend you do the same thing and will continue to blitz that until like i said, we have a very finely ground mixture and instead of trying to think of a very clever way to describe it.
let me just show you.
think you want alright very finely ground.
but not pasty.
so we do n't wanna go too far.
but it does have to be ground fine enough to hold a shape.
because we 're going to form these in the balls and or other shape soon.
so that 's looking good, and at this point, we can transfer that to obel and kind of press it and pack it down, and then what we want to do is cover this and let it sit for an hour or two before we start forming are falafel.
and yes, i have done these without letting it rest and it does work.
but by stick it in the fridge for an hour to those flavors really are going to meld together.
it 's going to be a little easier to work with which is never a bad thing.
so i did put mine in the fridge for a couple hours ready to shape.
and i 'm just going to make some small balls going to use one of these little sore bay scoops, which not only gives me the shape i want.
but it also ensures these are about the same size each and by the way, one tip.
if you my senior fingers these are a lot easier to work with.
in fact, there 's an old saying in the falafel industry.
damp hands, it makes smooth balls, and it really is true, right.
so we 're going to form our falafel into the shape of our choice, and at that point they 're ready to fry sewing, took these in three hundred and fifty degree oil for roughly five minutes, and of course that time is going to vary with your size.
and shape, but for the ones i did hear five minutes was just about perfect.
and i 'm just playing with him here.
you do n't have to do this.
i was just bored, so i gave mister.
but like i said, we 're going to cook those for about five minutes, at which point they should look like this beautifully browned and crispy on the outside.
oh , yeah, those look done.
so will transfer those on to iraq, too cool for a minute place.
you can see that gorgeous inside look at that beautiful color, and right here you can get a real, good look at that texture inside it should n't be too wet.
it should n't be too dry.
it should have the texture of falafel and his use on our last video.
i serve these with some teeny sauces and dip which is just a very simple and very beautiful way to serve him.
and i hear you out there, those look amazing, but chef, john.
i do n't have a deep fryer.
there 's no way i could do these well, i got some great news.
you do n't need a deep fryer instead of making balls just flatten them out into patties and pan.
fry them for a couple minutes per side.
it works beautifully.
and they really do come out just as gorgeous, you 're about to hear just as crispy.
and now it does that technique work.
but if you 're going to cheers into a pedia to make the traditional falafel sandwich that shape actually works better.
so , i threw a couple in oppida, which i generously swipe with hummus with some diced tomato cucumber and onion, and of course, finished it with a drizzle.
and that my friends for a sandwich that was not invented in america is incredible.
just one of the all time great fast foods of the world.
and i know that 's a concept.
it 's hard for a lot of people who grasp healthy delicious and beautiful fast food.
but anyway, that 's it.
i 'm going to finish the rest of that off demo inspired you to give these a try and what if it does n't, i 'm not going to lie.
i 'll feel awful, you know, some of these punches right themselves.
but seriously i really do hope you give these a try soon.
so head over to food wishes, dot com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual, and as always enjoy.
