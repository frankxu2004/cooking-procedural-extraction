hi , my name is andrew fairlie.
today , i 'm going to be cooking a dish called colcannon, there 's a dish using albert bartlett rooster potatoes.
some savoy cabbage some spring onions, some butter, and a little bit milk.
so what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to puberty tools, and boil them.
i have some boiling behind me.
next , i 'm going to do is take savoy cabbage.
i 'm going to cut the cabbage in half then into quarters.
any outside leaves, i 'm going to remove i 'm going to remove the core from the cabbage.
so , first i 'm going to do.
is just slice the cabbage is.
fine , as i can OK so that 's a cabbage sliced.
so what i 'm going to do.
now is just put that enter bought a pot of boiling salted water and cook that roughly two or three minutes to the cabbage is just tender OK.
so where the cabbages cooking , there.
i 'm just going to match these potatoes.
the potatoes at this point do n't need to be perfectly smooth.
i actually prefer them if they have a little bit of texture to them as well OK.
so that 's a cooked in drain cabbage.
i 'm just going to put the cabbage in there, generally about half the quantity of cabbage to potato, saw one kilo potato is five hundred grams of cooked cabbage.
so we just cook the cabbage so it 's tender.
just taste a little bit will tell you just a little beta, not too softap.
so that 's a whole potato and cabbage there.
so what i 'm going to do.
now is i 'm just going to finish it with the spring onions in the milk, just going to pour the milk into their.
so i 'm going to put the spring onions into the milk.
so we have time that comes to the boil that 's ready to grow.
so that 's the theater and cabbage mixed together OK.
so that 's the spring onions and the milk brought to the boil.
so i 'm just going to pour that in a better time.
so really what we 're looking for here is a kind of nice fluffy mashed potato with a subtle flavor of onion just coming through from the cabbage and what i find.
if you 're making this in any quantity at all what i would do is put into an electric mixer with the paddle.
attachment , but the paddle attachment gonna rain slowly just pour your milk in so what we 're looking for here is a second a nice fluffy texture.
what we do n't want is a wet potato purity, so, i think we 're almost there now with this.
so i 'm just going to tip it into serving bowl so the potato needs to be nice.
and haut so you can see it 's a nice fluffy mashed potato, and to finish that off.
i 'm just going to put a nice healthy mobile butter in the middle, just a male over the potatoes.
so there we have a hot steaming bowl of cocaine.
and so it 's much potential.
sliced cabbage some spring onions and an eight in order of fresh butter on top.
