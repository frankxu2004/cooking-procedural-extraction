time for a deep fried seafood delight that is surprisingly simple to make, let 's make some salt and pepper squid on the one part.
sheriff , let 's make some salt, and pepper squid first.
i 've got four large squid tubes also known as squid hoods.
and we 're just going to slice along one side to open it up using a sharp knife.
we just going to cut little diagonal lines along the inside surface.
you do n't need to cut all the way through just score.
those marks, all on the inside pet that dry with a bit of paper, towel just to get any excess liquid off and simply slice the squid up into small patients.
that 's our squid, chopped up so we can just set that aside, while we work on our coating next.
i 've got a snap lock freezer bag now.
this makes things so much easier when it comes to crumbing things.
i 'm going to put in a quarter of a cup of plain, all purpose flour, two tablespoons of corn flour or cornstarch.
this helps to add a nice sort of silky texture to this crime.
this is salt and pepper squid.
after all, so we 're going to put in a little bit of salt and some pepper and just to add a little bit of extra flavor.
i 'm adding in about a teaspoon of garlic powder and for a little bit of pep.
i 'm pulling in about half a teaspoon of chili just give that a bit of a shake around just to mix everything up.
next going to add in our squid pieces.
and we 're just going to see all this up, and gently toss it around to coat squids lovely, encoded.
so we can set that aside, while we heat up our oil.
i 've got about one liter, or four cups of cooking oil on just using some regular vegetable oil for this, and i 've got it in my big walk over a high heat.
and we 're just heating up that oil until it gets to about one hundred ninety degrees or until a piece of bread dropped into the oil.
turns noticing goldmoon about ten seconds were going to gently place about half of our squid pieces into the oil and will allow this to cook for about four minutes or until.
they curl up and go nice and golden.
try not to overcook them because otherwise they 're going final rubbery.
few minutes later, and our squid is lovely in golden, it 's curled up and looking gorgeous.
so we just take that out with a slotted spoon and transfer it onto a plate lined with some kitchen paper towel to drain off any excess oil.
and then will allow this oil to come back to temperature, the risks of a squid and here.
we have our completed salt and pepper squid which i 'm just serving with a little bit of tartar sauce.
but of course, you could serve this with some garlic aioli, or just squeeze a lemon wedge over the top absolutely fantastic, the smells.
i cannot wait to have a taste.
there is nothing like freshly made seafood, especially when it 's got this wonderful kramnik summer, so i 'm going to have a dip and advertised.
young it 's lovely and perfectly cooked.
we got that wonderful mixture on the outside not too spicy and lots of flavor there.
yum , well, i hope you enjoy this recipe.
check out mother videos at one pot chef show dot com and until next time.
see you later, this took no more than about twenty minutes to make it was very simple.
very , very effective.
and trust me.
