hi , this is aaliyah and today 's.
if you search is very exciting because we 're going to learn how to book something that not many people cook at home.
we 're going to make muscles in french we call the moon in moroccan bush, look.
so when i went to restaurants i heard that many people order them for appetizer as an appetizer or main dish with tomato sauce or grass or whatever.
but i wo n't see many people cooking them at home, and i think the recent is they think it 's difficult.
but today, i 'm here to prove to you.
how easy it is to make muscle at home.
there 's to make their delicious because we 're going to make them more rockin style with tomato sauce and charmoula devices.
you are going to love this recipe on top of that when you put it on your table.
people are going to think you 're a professional chef.
and i promise that.
so that 's it.
let 's stop the most important step.
is this one make sure that the muscles are fresh, and the way we test this is of course you buy the fresh, and then here i put them in cold water and as you notice their clothes, they 're not open and even if there are little open.
if i push a little bit on the muscle is going to close itself, if the muscle is open and other clothes in cold water or when you touch it then throw it right away it means it 's dead, the muscles are alive and that 's why they react to the cold water.
fortunately , we have to cook them alive.
but you 'll forget this fact when you eat them because they 're very young.
so what are the muscles.
is that it means it 's going to be toxic, and you 're going to get sick?
so really, really important, and also make sure you wash your muscles very well, and you scrub them and their clean.
i 've already done that.
so i 'm ready to cook them, we need a large pot.
so on medium high heat drizzle, the olive oil add the tomato sauce, and this is plain tomato sauce from a can add a chopped tomato to get a little more texture here, we have chopped garlic.
i 'm at half of the parsley and cilantro.
now and half later.
so keep that slowed leader, and for the spices, i have fabrica, que men salt and pepper and that 's it makes it all cover your pots and cook it for a few minutes until the tomatoes start bubbling.
so they 're hot enough in this sub public after five minutes, you notice the tomato is basically boiling the tomato sauce mix.
it well, and now at the muscles, and i drain them from the water to discover them directly.
that makes this one is broken.
so i 'm going to take it away.
i can see it.
but this one is broken no weights getting myself anyway.
so now just makes all of them like this cover your pot and cook the mussels for around ten minutes on medium high heat from time to time.
check on the muscles.
make sure there 's enough liquid in the pot.
so the tomato sauce is there that 's good, otherwise, if it 's not enough, you can add a little bit of water.
but here i did n't even add water and as you notice the muscle start opening.
and that 's a good sign because now there of course, dying and cooking so they should open, so, let 's get so continue, cooking them.
our muscles are ready.
i cook them for around fifteen minutes as you can see the sauces thicker there.
all opened up this is perfect.
and now i 'm going to add the rest of the parsley and cilantro.
so i 'll just mix it in so it 's fresh and tasty.
now i 'm ready to serve them, and that 's it.
the muscles are ready, was n't that easy right?
i promise you.
it 's a very, very easy recipe, but look how it looks.
it 's like dish from a restaurant is like a professional chef, make this right, and i 'm going to taste it for you, you serve it with bread baghat, french bread, the italian bread, whatever bread, you want crusty bread, and.
so use the bread to dip it in the sauce look at this saw.
so young, and it smells, oh, my god look at this.
so it 's really, really good.
let me just a muscle for you.
the salt is so flavorful.
just follow the steps are so easy.
