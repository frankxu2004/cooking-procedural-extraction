so i 'm going to be using an onion.
red pepper or capsicum, topless teens of coconut milk.
i 'm using some laksa paste that you buy at the supermarket.
i 'm going to try using the hokkien noodles.
although you could use two minute or ramen, noodles if you wish and for my seafood, i 'm using these beautiful, fresh local prawns or shrimp.
now you can use whatever seafood you like, or you could use chicken as well, but prawns are nice and easy and simple.
so i 'm just going to use them.
so what i 've done is cut.
the caps come up into fine strips, and you do n't have to use capsicum, but i just like it for the colour have also diced the onions.
and i have cut their heads off these prawns, which i 'm now going to wash.
now i 'm going to leave the cell on them.
but if you do want to peel them, please do.
OK , so, first i 'm just going to add a little bit of oil.
i 'm going to add the onions and relaxes souls now sunday at patrols.
we 're going to cook that for about that spicy going to cook that for about three minutes, keep staring at occasionally after the three minutes we 're going to add one half of the coconut milk and the capsicum disturbed that, through we 're going to turn the heat down once that starts to boil, anne let that simmer for about five minutes.
uncovered now, if you think that source is looking a little bit, too thick, just add one tin of the coconut milk and maybe half a team of water.
now while it 's simmering for five minutes time to prepare the noodles now, these noodles are very easy to prepare.
and he takes a minute just need to put them in a bowl, then cover them with boiling water.
then you just need to gently separate them, using some toms.
and we 'll just let them sit for about a minute now once that one minute is up.
we just need to gently dry in the water from the noodles now by the time those noodles overall hated the prawns should be nicely cooked.
and it 's time to serve up.
so now it 's just time to for this mix, fill up that ball.
