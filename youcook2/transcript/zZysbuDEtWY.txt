benedict seems like a complicated in fancy dish to pull off is really just a plate of saucy eggs, ham and toasts.
all the parts can be made ahead and put together right before you serve it, including a quick version of hollandaise sauce that i make in the blender start the holiday sauce by filling a large saucepan about halfway full with water and bring it to a simmer over high heat, then turn it off and set it aside, you 're going to use this to keep the sauce form.
the classic way to make hollandaise sauce is to whisk egg yolks.
and lemon juice, over double boiler, and then slowly add in melted butter.
but the problem with this is that you can end up scrambling your eggs, or if you add the butter too fast, you can break your sauce.
but i have a foolproof way of making the same sauce with a lot less hassle.
get your blender add two egg yolks in one tablespoon blend on medium speed for about thirty seconds or until it 's lightened in color, then reduce the speed to low take out the small cap from the lid and slowly drizzle in eight tablespoons of melted butter, turn off the blender, add half a teaspoon of kosher salt and a quarter teaspoon.
pepper ann pulls to combine them boom the sauce is done.
just stick it in hot water to stay warm for later.
now get ready to poach the eggs grab a medium sauce pan and fill it with about two cores, or at least two inches of water at four teaspoons of white vinegar and bring it to a simmer.
silly poached eggs.
you should make sure to do three things.
the first thing is make sure that your water is just barely at a simmer 'cause.
if you have a boiling rapidly, those big bubbles are just going to rip your egg apart the second thing is, you want to make sure not to skip adding the vinegar.
because the vinegar is there to help keep the egg whites together, and the last thing is make sure to crack your egg into a little bowl or ramekin , first.
because if you just pop it in there straight from the shell the yolk and break at four eggs to the water, and cook without poking at them for about three minutes, then it use a slotted spoon to lift the eggs out is to be said.
and you can use your finger to check for firmness.
put them in a bowl of warm water and set them aside, then split two english muffins, toast them cope with a little butter and season with a little salt and pepper, well, the muffins are toasting warm up the ham.
the easiest way to do this is in the microwave.
but you can do in a frying pan as well, the classic ham to use for an eggs benedict is canadian bacon.
but i prefer thinly sliced ham.
because i do n't like wrestling with that tough casing.
now you have all the parts ready, put your muffin down and top it with some of the ham, then get your slotted spoon.
lift the egg from the water, an use a paper towel to absorb the excess water, place the egg on the ham and drizzle with plenty of the hollandaise sauce.
if you want sprinkle, a little bit of paprika have a classic and elegant breakfast that you can serve for sunday brunch or for mother 's day, you 've got a crunchy muffin, insulting him and a perfectly poached, GUI egg, with lemony, hollandaise sauce on top.
