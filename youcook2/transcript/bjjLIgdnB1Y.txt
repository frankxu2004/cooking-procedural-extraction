hi and stephanie jaworski of joy baking dot com today, we 're going to make pancakes.
this is a really easy batter to make.
you only need two bowls, one for the wet ingredients in one for the dry ann will start with the dry ingredients in a large bowl place.
one cup that 's one hundred and thirty grams of white all purpose flour and the flower will give us a structure to the pancakes and then we 're going to add two tablespoons.
both thirty grams of granulated white sugar and the sugar will give us sweetness moistness and also helps with the browning of the pancakes and then we 're going to add one and a half teaspoons of baking powder, and this will provide the light and airiness to the pancake and then lastly a quarter teaspoon salt, which helps bring out all the flavors, and then i 'm just going to wish this all together to combine, you want any lumps.
and then for the wedding ingredients, you want them, all at room temperature, and i 'm going to use one large egg, and i 'm going to just wish that.
now the egg will bind all the ingredients together.
plus it helps with richness, an with browning of the pancakes and to that i 'm going to add two tablespoons that 's about thirty grams of melted butter and have that at room temperature and the butter gives nice moistness to the pancakes and richness, and, of course, helps with the flavor and lastly one cup that 's two hundred and forty mil liters of milk now, you could use whole milk two percent, or even skim and just keep in mind that the higher the fat content of your milk, of course, the richer, in flavor, the pancakes will be i 'm just using the two percent here.
so just gently with this together OK, we 're done we 're just.
now all we gotta do is just make a well in the center of your dry ingredients and pour your wet into the center there.
now to get a nice tender pancake we just want to mix the ingredients together just until everything 's moistened, you do n't want to get too much gluten developed.
so you do n't want to be really vigorously stirring this you can see, this is easy to make.
now if you wanted to the night before you could get all the dry ingredients put together in one bowl and just cover that with plastic crap and then you could even put all the wet ingredients together and cover and put that in the fridge and then just mix it together.
now we just want to stir this until moistened.
now do n't worry if there 's some lumps that 's OK, OK.
so that 's our batter now, i 'm going to use here an electric griddle if you have one of these set it at three hundred and fifty degrees fahrenheit that 's a hundred and eighty degrees, celsius, if you do n't have, one of these, you can just use a frying pan on the stove and set your heat to medium, medium high heat and try to use a frying pan that is pretty heavy duty that has a flat bottom.
because you do n't want warps and then you 'll have uneven cooking up the pancakes and then, you know, your pan is ready stove if you take a little drop of water and just put it on it would kind of spider, then, you know, your pans ready, and you may have to adjust the heat as you 're cooking your pancakes.
if they doing too fast or not brown enough, you can just put your heat up or down.
now i 'm just going to use a nonstick cooking, spray that kind of keeps you 're worried about your fat that would just keep it down.
you could also just rub the your pan with either with a brush or with a piece of paper, towel oil or melted butter.
so i 'm going to use a ladle to make my pancakes.
and you could also put your batter in a large measuring cup and then just poured on whichever way you want.
and of course, you can make your pancakes as big or small as you want just make sure that you space some a little bit apart.
because as you know, the batter will spread a bit, just keep that in mind.
so let 's make both that large.
i 'll just do a couple.
of course, i could probably do more on this pan.
but and, then.
because if you 're using a nonstick surface, make sure you use something that you do n't want to use a stainless steel that will scratch your surface and then when do to flip them as you can see the pancake will start to get lots of bubbles and craters and when the surface is pretty well covered with the bubbles and some of them are starting to burst then, you know, it 's time to flip, and you can also just take your spatula and kind of put under, and just check to make the underside is you want a nice and golden brown that takes maybe two three minutes depending on your heat, which as i said, you can adjust, if you 're finding, it 's not browning enough OK and you can see there 's lots of bubbles on the top surface and some of them have popped.
so i 'm going to flip this and then just did n't see nice golden brown as you can see you can adjust the color by how soon you flip it and then just cook it on the other side.
now the, the second side will not brown as much as the first side.
so just keep that in mind.
let 's take one two minutes more you want to make sure they 're cooked all the way through OK you can say the second side is not quite as brown.
now when your pancake when you take them off the heat, there is a tendency 'cause it looks cool to stack them all up one on top of the other.
but do n't do that.
because what happens is the bottom ones get all soggy.
so try to have a plate or platter like this, and just do it this way now, if you were n't serving, these right away.
so your families still in bed you could just turn your oven to one hundred and seventy, five degrees fahrenheit, that 's about eighty degrees celsius and just put these pancakes directly on the wire rack and that you can keep them there for about fifteen twenty minutes.
so now if i was when you make more pancakes what i would do is again spray or put a little more oil or butter and just make another batch the same ways first, and you could just serve these with butter and maple, syrup, or some people like jam, or just some powdered sugar, sprinkled over top and if you have leftovers after you could just freeze them and then you can either re reheat them in the oven, or just put him in your toaster frozen.
and they 're really pretty good.
so until next time i 'm stephanie jaworski of joy of baking dot com.
