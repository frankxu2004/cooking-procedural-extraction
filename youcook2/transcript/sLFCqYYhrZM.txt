hi guys, and learn, but alley on this opposite of lauren, the kitchen i 'm going to share with you.
my recipe for a classic caesar salad now i some of you might know.
i used to work with my dad in a restaurant for a very, very long time, and we always made our own dressing and the caesar salad was one of the most popular salads and addressing was probably the reason for that, so, let me take you over to ingredients.
so you can get started.
you 're going to some fresh romaine lettuce that i 've washed, dried and chopped some still bread preferably italian bread there.
just chopped into cubes or bite size.
pieces freshly grated downloaded john also.
i 'm worship sure sauce.
you need some garlic little anchovy paste dijon mustard fresh.
lemon juice, salt pepper ann, good quality extra virgin, olive oil.
now in the restaurant we decided to when we came up with the caesar salad, dressing recipe, we 'd made a decision that we were not going to be putting raw eggs in it.
now , real, traditional, traditional caesar salad.
i think does have wrote.
emulsify , are just kind of keep everything together?
we did n't want to do that.
because you 're serving into the public, you know, you do n't know, his allergies or who just ca n't consume raw eggs.
so we thought we were going to just omit it and.
then , adding a little dijon mustard and that 's emulsifier.
that 's what keeps it all together, so great news, no eggs.
in this recipe, and the anchovy paste is completely optional.
you do kind of need it for a traditional caesar dressing recipe.
you wo n't take the anchovy, but it just taste like a salty background, if you 've eaten caesar salad out.
so if you like that, then chances are you like this recipe, OK.
first thing you want to do is the oven.
bring it to four hundred because we 're going to get our croutons in there because they kind of takes the longest to kind of come together.
what i have here is just some italian bread that i bought it yesterday.
so it 's a little stale.
and i 'm going to do a little bit of olive oil on them and then just toss it into the olive oil.
just like so it 's going to give flavour and help it brown.
and now i 'm just going to put this into the oven and let them cook or bake for about ten minutes or until lightly.
golden brown and crispy now.
while the croutons or bacon away, we 're going to make the dressing.
i like to make mine in a just a big glass jar like this, but it 's easy, you can do this in a little bowl.
obviously in here, i 'm going to put it in my anchovy paste in my dijon mustard okie, doke, and then we 're going to put in, it wishes your sauce.
fresh lemon juice.
and then for the garlic, you can either mince it really, really finally.
or you can just use a grater to grate it so that you know, it 's super, super fine, because you do n't want to bite down.
yeah , we do n't want that you do n't want to be able to bite down on a big piece.
it keeps going in there.
i do n't know why, but i 'm just going to keep getting it until there.
we go you 're mine.
now i went, OK, get it off the back.
and now i 'm going to another half moon whisk, and i 'm going to wish this altogether.
because i want to make sure that the garlic and the vision mustard in the anchovies, well mixed and.
now while whisking in a drizzling some good quality extra virgin olive oil.
now it looks great.
like that for now, said this, we 're going to add in our freshly grated probably generally journal, i greeted ahead of time just to save on time.
now , i think this is most common for a caesar dressing.
but i do know that some places have like a mayo, based caesar, dressing i personally do n't care for that.
but that 's why i make my own.
and this is how i like it, a control within it, and that 's pretty much how i wrote.
so now i want to do.
is i want to taste it.
now , i 'm not seasoning it yet going to taste it perfect.
so , i know how much, how much salt to put in.
because the anchovy paste is of course, salty and the cheese is salty.
so i do n't want to go blindly into it and season.
it so, i 'll just give it a slight taste so good.
it is just delicious, delicious dressing.
and you do not trust me.
i 've said this before to you guys.
if you 've been cooking for me for awhile, you know, that i do not care for raw anchovies at all.
in fact, you know, this more traditionally, used like anchovy, fillets.
i use the anchovy paste because there are just no texture is just smooth sailing, and it just gives up saucy, but you do n't taste any fish.
so now i 'm just going to clean up, get my croutons, but the things together and we my croutons are ready.
they only were in the oven for i would say about ten minutes.
oh , yeah, so excited this is one of my favourites, exactly one of my husband 's favorite salads.
i 'm not going to pour all the dressing on it because i personally do n't like a salad when it 's drowned, and dressing.
i like when it 's just coded slightly.
if you want to you can put some more cheese on top, i know i will, but just not just yet.
i want to give a good talk, and then give it a taste.
i mouth is watering will do that.
let me eat in a little bit.
before now, i 'm just going to taste, i need i want that piece right there.
like this is going to be a mouthful room, run, oh, so good.
and when you make it there see why everybody always loves it not fishy, not overpowering, it 's just perfect.
top it, with some grilled chicken, and you have the best grilled chicken caesar salad of life.
i have enjoyed my time with me.
give this recipe a try because once you do i guarantee you 'll never buy the bottle stuff ever again.
it is ten times better took thirty seconds to put together, and you going to enjoy it, and i promise you that get this recipe and others could WWW dot.
laura in the kitchen dot com, i 'm going back for more, and i see you next time.
