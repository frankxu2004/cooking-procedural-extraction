we are making spring rolls and not just any spring.
rolls healthier baked one and not just healthy baked ones but jumbo ones for these spring rolls, we need to marinate our chick in, in some chinese spices.
and we put in our philo pastry with loads of other crunchy colorful veg out pepper carrot spring on you.
so , so much going.
we listen to order that check in that case, you can start the chick in again right.
so , jamie, you 're going to slice are chick in into really thin strip thinner.
the better mean, they 're going to cook a lot quicker, then we 're going to add some flavoring to it.
we 've got some chinese five spice then once jamies couple is chick in that goes in there.
and you still look good mix up to marinate all about chick in while you 're doing that.
i 'm going to start on them out, over here.
what the garlic peeled and then crushed and actually, as well, as we just cut around the pith and then all these ingredients just going to shop nice and find out my best to get my hands yet.
and that way you can message you get all the little bits and pieces around something yesterday was wrong with the breasts and the longer you can leave that the better good sort of couple of hours.
but we 're just going straight on cousin, uh, flavors in there, anyway, this is quite healthy spring roll.
so we 're going to add no extra order them we got it already says more on the chicken that 's enough you can just put it in there, smoking hot pan and scatter out scott layer.
and then if you can get rid of ordering stuff and what their hands down there and i will finish our celebrate changes well, tailing up for that he that should be moving into optum.
we 've got our garlic.
we gotta chili, now deliberate ginger as well, which would just great up jamie.
if you get a clean border underneath your fresh coriander and if you can shop that nice and fine, and we 're going to divide all these ingredients into two half of our garlic, and ginger and chili in there, and half in the other death pop and coriander.
so intro with some sesame E oil.
some soy and some honey and that becomes our depth.
did you give that?
stare out on the back later few more.
vegeta , chopper, i 'll do pepper into the camera here the carrot and then cut little feelings of it.
apparently wo n't really, really thin strip annoying spring onions, same thing, thin, thin strips.
so there we going to put my spring onions into the bowl and as soon as you guys are done if you can put your and carrot in there as well.
why does this have to be so fit because we 're going to roll them up.
you want loads of all different flavors in that, each bit is too chunky.
you wo n't end up with enough difference want everything while you 're finishing that language.
you can check in now.
i need to strip it up again.
so we 've got bits like that you really like, shipping in the kitchen.
it 's allowed this is a bit of preparation and shopping involved in this dish.
but once you 've made them, they can sit in the fridge for a little while until you need them.
so you can make them way ahead of time so all of our check in go in there.
pepper and carrots chopped carrots give hoping it picks up, and then we 'll move everything to one side.
we need this space to do are rolling?
so how would jumbo are these jumbo screen roles, as big as our philo pastry, will allow we 're going to buy this stuff already done easier, just one sheet and what we need to do to crack an egg only with your patient infused butter.
but this is our healthier version.
so we 're going to get away with an egg with cup and give it a light brushing and then our jumbo bit plenty of this filling only to pack it in.
so get plenty of that in there we fold in both edges like that, and then we need to wet and damp.
and this is our actions with glue as well.
and then this is difficult, because it will start to rip it first.
and you keep going.
and it should hold it shaped like a duck pancake like a duck pancakes by the time you get to the end.
you got several rolls of this fantastic billing, make plenty of egg.
the bottom stick it.
maybe one more, those now we can lay them on a baking tray, and we just need is another brush with egg as soon as various, done with brush.
well , we 're taking your time on these make them way ahead in advance and then you come off when you need them or bus last, well, yes both of those jake into our part, two hundred degrees celsius until they go nice and crispy on the outside by fifteen minutes look at those lovely and glossy crispy on the outside and hopefully it 's often inside safely in there, i think will cut into one of these, you can see exactly what 's going on in the inside.
they should because being paid because they 're egg.
they hold their shape perfectly there.
we go so you can see everything inside of there.
so i 'm going to take one of our big ones.
and then one of those half cut once you can see exactly what 's going on there it 's our healthier version there bake their full of fresh crispy vegetables.
it 's our jumbo chicken spring rolls there.
we go thank chris.
but these are pretty awesome as they are.
but make sure you get dipped to make it even better always quite hot always request.
now you get the flavors jumbo.
yeah , you know, other things go back to small ones after this.
once you have big, you just do n't go back to you.
