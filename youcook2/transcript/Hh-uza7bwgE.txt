this rustic snail dish with spinach and walnut better is appreciated by french people of all ages in a bowl with better, i had some chopped shallots chopped.
garlic chopped parsley, chopped walnuts a little salt and pepper and the juice of alpha lemon.
i combined this battle well, with a folk.
flatten it between two layers of baking paper and place it on ice too hard, and the idea is to chill the batter.
so it is easier for me to put it evenly on the snails.
next a mix.
a little cream into one cup of cooked spinach, a spoon.
a little spinach into four grattan dishes and top each with twelve cook snails.
i covered the snails with so little herb butter and sprinkle.
generously , with bread crumbs i like to bake it in a hot oven for about five minutes.
these escargot or bird there be do n't want smell wonderful and test even better.
