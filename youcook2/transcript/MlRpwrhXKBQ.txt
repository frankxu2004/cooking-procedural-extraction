hi , this is tony for cooking around today.
we 're going to make buffalo chicken wings.
my way i will show you how to prepare the chicken wings, and then i 'm going to show you how to make a nice fast, fast super fast, sauce to go with it.
first of all, i have a bowl here one kilo of chicken wings.
so we take with chicken wings and in order for the chicken wings here is basically in three peace is the drum the center, and the tip, got other day 's work with the protocol.
now we 're going to cut it right about here and reduce this drum part.
the tip, some people like to remove it.
that 's my favorite part one to start so what we do is we take this chicken wing.
and we just cut right down the center here, and it comes right off and there.
we go now i 'm going to prepare the rest now.
i have cut up the chicken into the various pieces that we 're going to use and at the same time.
it 's already washed now.
what i have to do is dry it.
so we take that and we draw it very, very, very good.
we have to drive very, very, well enough to get really nice and dry.
so here 's a chicken wings and now what we do is we take a little bit of oil, you know, well, let 's say use oil, which.
this has no flavor, well, basically use what you want turn it off and just take that then.
we just look across their over things like that now fasting is the best thing easiest now.
we 're going to add question about half a cup of white flower because i do n't have that many chicken wings here.
and of course himself you probably ask him why does this guy always is this little tiny bag.
well , it 's a long story micro from promise to buy me this specialty the wholesale for cooking, and it 's not here yet.
so until it comes, this is what i 'm going to use.
and we just put some salt on there too much, of course the famous brush, brush ground pepper like a little bit more my girlfriend, a vegetarian is not going to be eating this top.
i have some chicken seasoning here.
which have some cayenne pepper in here.
and some other goodies you can just use cayenne pepper or do n't even put it at all.
i just put because some people may not want to have it with the hot sauce so they can just have with this, and then just be more mild.
now we do is we 're going to transfer this into a back to make sure the bank has no whole use.
you can use a garbage bag news.
basically type of bag as long as it 's clean, it is nothing inside so.
now it 's people bag and i already checked to make sure there 's no holes, and i just dumped the whole thing inside.
like that girls air flow air pockets in their spin around 'cause i 'm going to rip it when i go take it off.
because you do n't do that sometimes it comes right out through the opening to do move the bag around not rocket science really, really easy.
so now put your fingers in there between the chicken and lucinda checking up to make sure is it 's a nice even cold there, we are.
now should bring over here.
take the bags now is the correct.
the bag drop it in.
and perfectly, perfectly sees it now or wait for profit OK, have a party with oil, have a baby about invention happened to reach us of?
well , you do n't really need anymore, i will have to do this in two batches though for the amount that have one kilo.
now how do we know that the oil is red, what you do just think point of chicken wings hold on your finger and just put it in until you see all the bubbles going there.
means is perfect temperature , now.
we do n't want the temperature very, very high because we do not want the outside to be cooked.
very , very fast and the inside is still not cook properly.
so make sure that your heat.
on the medium.
at this point an all you do now is just grab your.
chicken , and just very carefully, very, carefully just drop them in sight and or stayed at your cook absolutely perfect, and here we are and your back.
and basically i like mike a little bit more crispy.
so i leave them in there for a little bit longer terms unless you 're not.
so you grab a ball here with paper towels and very carefully.
we just throw them into the goal, now what i do from here is after i dry them with the paper.
they do n't become soggy.
and they hold themselves very crystal OK, so here 's our delicious chicken wings and welcome back.
we are now going to make sauce for buffalo chicken wings.
they are trying there right now.
so grab yourself a patch.
it 's already heated and what we do is, we take about half a cup of butter and put them in there, now, we wait for that develops, we do n't want it to burn.
so make sure that he goes.
now road now.
so we do we had a little bit less of one third of ketchup yes ketchup mixture life, a lot easier.
i took it with multi building lower corporation.
so must be good.
he thought lunar eclipse holding it there.
you go that 's all that really, really nicely and now there is also a source.
my tomato paste, which you can find on my other video.
but if you do n't want to use that basically use any type of hot sauce that she wants.
but i like my own.
so i talking about little bit, less about a quarter of a cup you can add more if we really, really wanna hot.
but i guess may not like it that talks so.
i just put it in less than a quarter of a cup.
and it 's true that around we had a little bit of salt just the pitch.
and now this secret two tablespoons of honey if you want looking brown sugar if you want instead, i like comes.
it 's more natural.
now we just run around, and there is are delicious, delicious lots, not too thick not too bad.
and , that is basically done notice here, that we have the chicken wings so you could know sauce on it.
just came out of the prayer like that and different sauce.
again , we have to do it.
taste test now.
and here 's a taste.
test me, that is, really money glitch in the news now.
so they doubled it.
i do n't think so.
here 's my wind, tossed everybody out there.
please do n't forget to misdescribed and remember, what i was saying good wine good food, and good friends makes a good life.
