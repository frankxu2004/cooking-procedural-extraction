mcconnell from japan.
i was born and raised in pajama, a very small town in japan and started my career, and ives, aleki working for the restaurant also name as kiss, a group.
i really like the new restaurant used to work for in japan, so i asked him to use their name as my restaurant, basically means easygoing frank down earth.
that 's what i want to do is widely serve in japan pretty much with any kind of meal.
like , you agree, with my breakfast, almost dinner combination lunch combination.
it 's basically it 's a family food, you know, it 's a home cooking.
so if you eat three times at home is definitely three times a day any region any household at different style.
so as long as you make them to cross part correctly you can just do whatever you want after that, you know, you actually start the water combo in it and they are flying in the water with the combo.
first , convoy actually contains a lot of the asset to give you a depth of the flavor that the body itself does n't give you.
so adding, get the little bit more body under soup, when you see enough kombu couples flavor in broth do add bonito in it and immediately turn the heat.
otherwise you boil high heat along time.
and wanted to give you a little bit of the kind of bitterness that she 's basically hard on the japanese food you cook a most of the food with dashie.
so you could visible, you cook with ashley you make soup you make with that.
it 's kind of soup base.
this is usually has some vegetable tofu, or sort of some sort of vegetable protein, plus it has no fat.
we usually serve it very simple basically come in C, read scallion and, but you can do a whole bunch of other stuff like my kids.
really , like the potato mississippi, and my home, so when we do it when you cook.
first make a soup and put the potato in it.
so it depends on whatever you want to put in it.
so you simmered with the low heat, while you rest of the process there.
you are some missile in it to the flavor you want.
but you have to be careful like missile.
sometimes missiles in that completely dissolved when you taste it then after all the tank missiles, get this all saltier.
so we 're going to be careful usually when i do it i stopped before it 's completely their solve missiles going to be eventually solved in the soup, yeah, then, yeah, for lunch for dinner steam rice mississippi, and i want to do vegetable dishes, said.
so mississippi, as a huge part of our meal anytime.
