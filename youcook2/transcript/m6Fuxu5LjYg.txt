hello , and welcome to easy gluten free today, we 're doing fried chikin but not just any fried chick in today.
we 're doing a crispy delicious KFC, copycat.
and this recipes been requested more times than i can count.
and i understand why since being gluten free means.
you just ca n't run to KFC and pick up the real thing.
but today, i 'm going to show you just how easy this is to make it home.
now , of course, no one actually has KFC secret recipe, nor do we have their patented pressure fryer in our home kitchens.
but after quite a few experiments with both the recipe and frying technique we 've got a fried chicken here that tastes amazingly like KFC OK.
now in a bowl.
large enough to house a whole cut up chick in add.
two cups of buttermilk.
and if you do n't have buttermilk in the house, you can make it yourself by adding a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice cup of milk, add one egg a tablespoon of salt and about two tablespoons of hot sauce and do n't worry contrary to how this looks this amount of hot sauce wo n't make it hot and spicy , now.
whisk it all together.
and once it 's combined, add the chick in and i 've got one chick in that was cut into eight pieces.
but the breast pieces were.
so large that i cut each of them in half.
so that cook, at about the same rate as the other pieces.
now let the chick in soak in the buttermilk, brine, refrigerated for four to six hours or even overnight then to dredge the chick in, will need to make a seasoned flour?
and , for that in a large baking dish add two cups of gluten free flour and today.
i use this rice flour blend, but i 'll put a link to my flower blend in the description box.
add one cup of cornstarch and whisk them together now for the spices.
i 'm adding two tablespoons of salt, one tablespoon of paprika, a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and a teaspoon, each of onion garlic, and chili powders ground sage and coriander old bay and black pepper.
now stir the spices into the flour mixture until everything is pretty well distributed.
and we can start tragic the pieces and to do that.
let the excess buttermilk drip from each piece of chick in than to sit around in the seasons flower to get it well coated on all sides and place it on a wire rack.
now for the wings you 'll want to talk back the wing tips, just like they do at KFC and when you have all the pieces code at once will cook them all again.
just dip each piece back into the buttermilk and into the flower again.
and once they 've all been coded twice leave them undisturbed on the wire rack for about an hour.
so everything it hears really well, and the chick incomes fully down to room temperature now to fry the chick in, in a twelve inch cast iron skillet.
he three quarters of an inch of vegetable three hundred and fifty degrees and i like to use it the monitor when i do fried chicken versus some other fried stuff 'cause the chicken is going to be in there for awhile.
so if the oils too hot the chicken can easily get too dark before it 's properly cooked, and i like to start fry and get about three hundred and fifty degrees, then try to maintain a temperature of about three hundred and twenty degrees for the rest of the cooking time, and you want to have a clean wire rack ready and waiting to drain the chick in.
now add the chicken in batches of four to five pieces.
at a time.
turn the pieces.
every three or four minutes to keep them from getting too dark before they 're fully cooked now.
the wings are going to take about ten to twelve minutes.
and the other pieces will take about fifteen to twenty minutes, depending on their size.
and once you have a deep golden skin and an internal temperature of a hundred and sixty five degrees the chickens done drain the pieces on a wire rack.
so the air can circulate and the skin will stay nice and crispy.
and this fried chicken is ready to devour.
and when you taste this and see how close to the colonel 's original recipe this really is you 'll never have KFC envy again.
i mean, just listen to how crispy.
it is this is some of the most amazing fried chikin.
