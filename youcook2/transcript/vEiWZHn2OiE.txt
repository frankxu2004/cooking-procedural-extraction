work on the benjamin TV today, i 'm going to make one of my more popular dishes from the blog carbonaro and this is carbon of spaghetti carbonara is delicious.
and , you know, what anybody can do it, and i 'm going to get right into the ingredients alright.
first off, i 've got spaghetti.
OK , i 'm just using store bought orilla if you want to use organic.
you want to use a fancy stuff from the farmers market, but you might guess i 'm just using this regular spaghetti also using egg.
i 'll be using two egg yolks, one four egg with the white, i 'm also going to be using parmesan cheese.
if you can get the fresh stuff and great, it yourself also, i 'll be using salt and pepper, an olive oil not optional.
because i know a lot of talons are watching this and saying.
that 's all you need optional.
if you want to take it to the next level, that benji man TV level, i 've also got sliced up garlic and heavy whipping cream.
the slice of garlic just gives it a little bit more flavor as well as the, uh, heavy cream just makes it a more silky smooth texture that i love when i serve carbonaro.
but you can totally take those two out last.
but not least i also have pancetta now, the pancetta.
you can substitute with bacon.
if you do n't have pancetta available, just make sure you go ahead and slice that up.
and thin alright, the tools that i 'll be using is obviously something to boil the pasta and make sure you fill that with plenty of water and get that to a rolling boil start, cooking, i 'm also using a twelve inch frying pan, uh, this is a saute pan.
but you can use a regular frame.
can also you 're going to have a whisk to whisk up the sauce?
you 're going to also be using tongues.
i have a ladle.
i 've got a spaghetti ladle.
also have a large spoon alright, first thing you 're going to do is slice or pentita nice and thin.
if you 're using bacon just cut that across the bacon and slice that thin as well, next, you 're going to go ahead and crack your eggs.
remember , you 're going to use the coax.
so you 're going to separate the egg yolk from the egg white.
do this by tossing the a go back and forth between the two shells.
next you, gonna, go ahead and shred some cheese at this point you 're going to go ahead and take your eggs parmesan cheese black pepper, if you 're using, heavy whipping cream, go ahead, and whis act together in a bowl.
first of all make sure you have your water boiling OK.
because you 're going to get your pasta cooking as soon as possible also get your tool bench pan heated cook it on the low heat.
because when i make pancetta, pancetta cooks fairly easily, and you want to make sure it 's on a low heat.
but make sure pan is nice and warm up first off, you 're going to put some olive oil into your pan.
next you 'll put that pancetta let the pancetta go ahead and cook for about five to ten minutes depending on how it cooks and if you 're using bacon once it gets crispy.
but not burnt, go ahead and turn the heat off and put that to the side at this point you 're ready to put your pasa in make sure that he, under the pot is at the highest you can get it and make sure it 's out of rolling boil, an put, your pasa, in follow the directions of your pasta what you 're going to want to do is make sure about two or three minutes before your pasta is done you 're going to turn the heat back on, on your twelve inch frying pan and what you 're going to do at this point is go ahead and throw that garlic in there, let this is a little bit.
but not to the point words to brown, just about a minute or two before your pulse is done, you 're going to want to go ahead and turn off the heat i think you 're going to do this is.
because you 're going to continue cooking the pasta that is just barely al dente, which is under cooked in the pan with the pancetta or bacon go ahead and drain your pots of very well, once that 's drained very well throw that right into the pen with the meet go ahead and mix it around for a few minutes on a medium heat and what you 're going to do is take that large spoon ladle in some of the water that you use a boil the passive to make sure that your plus it does n't stick to the pan going to be the base of your sauce after a few minutes of cooking on that medium he you 're just about done remember you do n't want to burn this.
but you want to make sure you cook the pasta through.
because it was all dente go ahead and add your pasta to the bowl and you 're going to put your egg wash right onto the pasa make sure all the bacon pieces are in there with deposit in that bowl and mix thoroughly while adding parmesan to taste, you can also add more black pepper if you 'd like at this point you 're just about done go ahead and, and you 're ready to eat a few notes i did n't use salt in the boiling water.
because of pancetta is.
so salty and saying goes for bacon that you really do n't need a lot of salt in this dish also, if you 're worried about the raw eggs the pasta and the bacon is.
so hot from the oil that when you put that aid into the posit it 's going to cook it slightly, and i would n't worry about it the final touch to this carbonaro i like to pour a little bit more olive oil to give us some elegance i need to eat part there you go?
that 's the carbonaro.
i 've got my friend guy here from DVD store dot com.
he actually helped us with the lighting today.
i wanted him to be the taste tester and i 've got green onions that we actually put as a garnish.
i got this idea from cooking with dog who was the inspiration for this recipe.
go ahead and you can put some on there is it.
good , is really good?
so anyways, that 's benjamin TV.
