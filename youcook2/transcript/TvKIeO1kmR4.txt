hi , my name is chris gato and i am the executive chef of uno chicago grill, and we are here at the uno 's test kitchen in today.
we 're going to make our world famous.
deep dish pizza something we invented in nineteen forty three.
so the first thing, we 're going to do today is may cardo what we 're going to do is start with a package of active dry yeast, going to place that into a bowl going to add some sugar and a little bit of warm water.
and we 're going to dissolve all that together.
we need to make sure that our water is between a hundred and five and one hundred ten.
we 're going to add that going to blend that real quickly.
and then we 're going to ask our flower in our salt.
once we 've got the flower in the salt in the bowl.
we 're then going to mix this altogether till it forms a nice, though and i 'll come together real easy as you can see.
so i do, is come together nicely?
but if you happen to notice that you doe is a little wet you could add a little more flour, or if it 's a little dry you can add a little bit more water.
once i do, is come together, we 're then going to need it now.
if you 're using a mixer, you would mix it for approximately four minutes, on medium speed until the dough is smooth and pliable using your hand.
you want to need it for approximately seventy eight minutes again until the dough is smooth and pliable.
so we 're almost done needing ardo.
proper technique is to use the palm of your hand kind of, push it out, folded over and then roll and what we 're really doing is developing the gluten here in the dough which, in layman 's terms just makes the dose strong, once we 're done with that.
we then again, i put it in a bowl.
so we 're going to put a little bit of olive oil in.
so , we 've got our bowl.
we put some olive oil in, and we want to coat the dough with the olive oil.
the reason for this is so that the dough does not stick to the ball.
so once we 've got our dough in its coated with olive oil we then want to cover it with, either a kitchen towel or a piece of plastic wrap going to let the dough sit at room temperature will take approximately two hours for this joe to proof and be ready to use.
however you could also put in the refrigerator overnight and use it.
the next day, if you do that, take it out.
before you 're ready to use it.
so the next step for our deep dish pizza is, we want to make our sauce and what we do is, we take some ground tomatoes.
we play some into a mixing ball, and then we 're going to add a little bit of dried oregano and some dry basil.
and some grated romano cheese.
and we 're just kind of mix these altogether to incorporate them.
and then we 're going to set this aside.
so now we 're ready to make our deep dish pizza ardo is been proving for two hours, and it 's approximately doubled in size, and what you need is a deep dish pan.
or you could use a cake pan.
this is twelve inches and it 's about approximately at one and a half inches in height.
so we want to take our dough out of the bowl.
and we 're just going to place it into the pan.
and then we 're going to take our hands.
and we 're just going to work the dough into the pan.
we want to evenly spread it along the bottom and into the corners and then we 're going to take our fingertips.
and we 're going to work.
that go up the sides of the pan and if the dough is properly made, it should work very easy we make our dote everyday.
fresh and all the restaurants, and it is so good.
we 're then going to take both provolone and mozzarella cheese and we 're going to lay the slices of cheese on top of the dough and obviously with all the cheese we put in here it will be overlapping.
so first thing we have is our provolone.
then we take our sliced mozzarella.
the beauty of this is, we have the sharpness of the provolone and the mildness of the mozzarella and together they create a fantastic combination.
once we 've got the cheese into the pan.
we then one more time want to take our fingers and really press the dough 'cause you 'll see it will start to come away from the sides.
so we want to make sure that we press it in there.
good and tight, now that we have our cheese in there, we 're going to take our tomato mixture that we made little earlier.
we 're going to place that on top of the cheese and then we 're going to spread it evenly over the entire pizza.
make sure we get it all covered.
and then once we 've got that we 're taking our pepperoni and we 're going to evenly distribute the pepperoni over the top of the sauce once we 've got that our pizza is ready to bake we 're going to make this in a four hundred seventy five degree oven for approximately twenty five to thirty minutes.
what you 'll see is that the dole get nice and golden brown, it will start to pull away from the sides when the pizza is done.
so here we have our finished deep dish pizza as you can see the edges and ice and golden brown, the dough is pulled away from the sides of the pan and.
because of the amount of oil in both the dough and we put in the bowl.
the pizza will not stick.
so now you too can make our world famous deep dish pizza at home.
