OK , we 're going to start by making a brine to make our chicken.
and you are going to start by adding our culture salt.
sour buttermilk followed by some hot sauce because i like flavor baby now.
let 's go ahead and start up and everything.
nice and combine this like that.
OK , never going to pour this brian over our chicken nest is one little five pound chicken that i 've cut up.
make sure the brian is completely covering.
the chicken we 're going to brine it for about one hour and that 's not too long after an hour, go ahead and pour that brian out.
we do n't need to know more.
so i just put it all out.
and then rinse your chicken.
really , really good.
we do n't need anymore of that salty brine left on this chicken, so rinse, rinse, rinse all right.
now is going to play for my chicken on a pan anywhere that you can see that it up, you put it on a plate where we do n't really matter just place on a pen.
because we are going to start seasoning here is a blend of seasonings.
