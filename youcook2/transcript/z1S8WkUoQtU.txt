so i have some fresh bread slices that i 've just crowned basically just grounded in the mix.
see just a little bit, and i 'm also going to add all the flavorings into the batter.
so a little bit of heat with some red chili powder some dry.
or ignore salt to taste and a little hint of garlic mix all the dry ingredients a number make the batter with some flaps.
aura keep whisking, get rid of all the lumps and this batter is ready.
