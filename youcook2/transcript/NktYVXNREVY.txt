hello , and welcome to another of my cooking videos at today.
i 'm going to show you how to cook real authentic check wash.
there is a IP decipi, isba cause there are a lot of recipes from chico lash on the internet.
and most of them are not authentic.
there are some floss for instance, i 've seen recipes containing things like bell peppers and tomato sauce and there are lot of things like that, either of their teacher garage.
so today i will show you how to cook real thing, so let 's take a look at some things.
we 're gonna need.
so there 's submit beef meat.
some onions, the ancient wisdom is that you meet about same volume of onions as meat so you can take a look at.
it 's roughly the same volume of meat and audience.
some lot some dark beer.
some garlic crushed or diced some spices and some big boned up, so we start up heating up some light now.
do n't you dare use cooking, oil not only that life tastes better?
it 's much more stable cooking.
fat , but it 's actually better for help.
provide it 's actually rendered.
did not do cute stuff?
from supermarket becaus that 's been industry processed, anne may be harmful for health but good old fashion.
he rendered block is actually good for you, and if we are going to use a lot of it so the lattice hold it up so we add audience.
we can see nicely ottomans are crying.
so i kick up the heat and let them cook still.
onions are nice golden car now, i, i found out that piece pat alone, ians are the best kind for blush, it seems to me.
it tastes better than with yellow, or right on the ends.
but you feel free to try any kind of audience.
you , like this is just my accommodation.
i just find those purple onions go best with the meat.
so now i just stir fry them until the nice translucent and big golden so the onions are now soft and lightly browned.
so i 'm going to add a meat.
now you can take a look at the meet.
this is beef shank.
you can see it 's not any pristine kind of meat.
it actually, you can see some tendons.
some fed it actually good kind of meat for blush.
it 's much, much better you want the fed will some tend to some ligaments in it.
this is what actually makes dense and tasty.
it 's also a bit cheaper, but this is actually very good.
this is gas fat.
so this is great meat, so now i 'm going to put it all in and get it bound.
so i 'm going to catch up the heat again.
and i 'm going to stare it together, it, on the end, and i get to meet nice and round now meat is browned.
so it 's time to add spices so the most single most important spice for blush is sweet.
paprika , now we are gonna dust very generously with three paprika.
it 's important not to overdo it.
becaus , then it takes bad, but takes quite a lot.
anyway , hailey, hailey generosity.
you , oughta cover it basically republica now.
this ought to be enough.
so i just stayed in maybe i feel it 'll be tomorrow, but africa is what makes garage brush what makes it different from any kind of basics.
two , yeah, it can use a little bit more than that, this ought to do it, it smells great two.
an idea, you know, garlic some measure little bit some black pepper that 's basic stuff some coming very important and to start chili peppers.
because i like it, i like it a bit spicy.
so you can start with only a little and later on te state and determine whether it needs more about i start just with a little bit.
be cause you can always add more.
but you can never separate it from the mirror by while it 's already in so now we can see it 's beginning to look like glass charcas tube.
so i just still cook it for awhile a little bit.
just a few seconds just to give a spices chance to blend with the meat and now, i 'm going to slowly, slowly at flutes.
so i start with beef, bungled.
this is homemade.
this is my own boom.
brought it 's not from the cube stuff.
but this is really my own home, and stuff since this is my last.
this is the rest of my supply.
i guess i 'm going to show you how to make both be one vertex time becaus this is all that, 's left.
but it 's really important so the quality of meal instead of a good great.
if you have some good quality homemade broth and not some instant cute stuff, it 'll makes quite a difference.
probably a type on taste, but it also makes me so much more nurturing so much more healthfully so much more nutritious volume, and be cause this is.
how do you check blush?
and each X laugh nothing more than our beer.
so i 'm going to add a little dark beer.
not too much.
BIH , cause that it would leak of beer.
but only bit of it like a cup at most to add the distinct bit flavor yeah, i did.
i think this is more than enough.
i 'm going to the interest later not today.
be cause i walked out earlier, based on basically this is all that we need to put in an all.
you really need to do now is to oh shit.
yeah , also, i forgot, this is my little secret.
if you live on the flavor of meat this mommy taste to come true.
you can add just a little bit really a little bit of some distant soy source.
but do n't match this is not chinese food.
but really, just a few drops to tweak the flavor kind of finishing touch.
and now we see this.
it 's more like a soup that there 's a lot of loot.
so now we bring it to boil again and let it simmer for at these two hours ideally , four.
but , at least two minimum OK.
so i 'll be back with you for hours from now and here.
we are few hours later.
i have just turned on the stove and as you can see the glass is finished this is.
i think this is beautiful.
you can see it has turned out beautifully.
it smells, it smells great.
it is nice color.
you can eat this in many ways in my opinion.
it 's really best way just this cities with piece of fresh salad bread.
but you can eat it with checkstyle sponge dumplings or the australian style round dumplings, or you can even eat it with pasta or born potatoes in it.
so there are many options.
but frankly, i just take a freshman corporate and eat it from the port as it is cause it.
great one last thing.
it 's not entirely ready to eat right now.
it should be made.
but if you let it sit overnight it 's best.
next day so just let it sit on the store on the window for moonlight, and it will be at its best.
next day, so just like to patients eight.
i hope you like this recipe.
i have to interrupt my video, and i 'll see you next time.
probably , be bold, worth.
thank you for watching.
