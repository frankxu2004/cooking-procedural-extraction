i 'm hilah anne welcome.
do hyla cooking, so one of the goals of our show is to sort of go over the basics, kind of cooking one, oh, one?
if you will so today i 'm going to show you make scrambled eggs.
super duper easy.
and it 's great things now, how to make if you want to make breakfast for yourself, or you want to make breakfast tacos or any number of things.
so i will show you starting right now.
so , basically all you need is eggs and butter.
some people like to add milk or water to their eggs.
personally , i do n't really notice a difference when i do that, so you can do it.
i do n't know.
i think maybe the extra liquid just helps you break up.
the , the egg more better on a really know, i 've heard explanations.
but i do n't necessarily believe it.
anyway , it is important to get some air mixed into your eggs.
so when you eat them, you can use it for it going to use a whisk 'cause it 's kind of more fun.
so you just want to do it a lot.
and it starts to turn sort of a lighter yellow, a lemon yellow.
get in there, get frothy on me and let me add a little salt and pepper, and we ready to cook alright.
let that preheat while i get my S and P in there that salt.
and pepper ann make set up again and another very important thing when you make, an eggs is to use the proper sized pan since i just have two eggs here.
wanna mall spread out and then you end up with sort of a cook, too fast, and then you get sort of tough eggs.
so i 'm going to cook slow and kind of deep.
i 've got it on high heat right now all the butter melts, and the butter is going to mount.
and then it 's going to kind of fill him up a little bit.
and that 's when i know it 's hot enough.
it 'll start to bubble one final wham, bam.
then , i 'm gonna pour.
my eggs, in OK now, do n't stir them right away?
let them acclimate to their new environment, turn your heat down to medium, low, and i started to cook around the edges here.
but i do n't want to miss that just yet.
now i do.
i 'm using a rubber silicone, spatula using metal spatula i want to be gentle with my baby eggs.
now i can start sternum a little more vigorously to break up the little clumps.
and when they are i like my eggs fully done.
but you want to take a mafe before there to the point of your liking, so, like this looks turn the heat off and just keeps turning them around for just a few more seconds do n't over cook.
and then there, there still look a little moist.
i 'm ready to plate, go ahead and get him on my plate and perfectly cooked scrambled eggs.
alright see here.
we have large curds.
they 're still moist, and delicious.
