today , we 're making shepherds pie.
now this is a healthy recipe.
i 'm going to be using ground lamb.
and we 're going to dress it up with some nice healthy spices like turmeric and, cinnamon and we 're going to cut back a little bit on our mashed potatoes.
and we 're going to replace some of that with some butternut squash, so, if that sounds good to you stay right here.
i 'm rockin robin.
and i 'll show you how to do it.
right , after this, are you ready to go over our ingredients and get started?
OK , let 's do it.
here 's our ground lamb.
i 've got a little over pound there in this dish here.
i 've got a combination of onion carrot and celery with the super.
ice , and i 've got some frozen peas.
some fresh zucchini out of my garden by the way, fresh basil out of my garden.
here i have a couple about three russet potatoes, and i 've got some butternut squash, and here 's our spices.
i got turmeric ground cinnamon and ground cumin and then we 're going to finish it off with some chicken broth.
i got some fresh minced garlic, some butter, and a little bit of salt and pepper and over here.
i 've got a little bit of coconut milk, and you can substitute half and half.
if you like if you do n't like, coconut milk, we 're going to start off our recipe by browning our lamb.
so i 've got my flame over here on medium high.
i 'm going to put a little bit of oil in the pan.
i did n't mention that in the beginning i was giving you the ingredients.
but just a little bit of oil, started off, slide that in there, right now, we 're cooking.
i 'm going to go ahead, and toss in my onions, carrots and celery.
i 'm going to add a little bit of salt for this right now and just a little toss of salt in there.
and i 'll show you.
what this looks like.
everything is cooked up while the lamb mixture is cooking.
we 're going to pour.
potatoes in our butternut squash into a steamer, and i 'm going to go ahead and keep sort of keep them separated, i 'll put the potatoes in one side and the squash on the other side.
because we 're going to separate these out when they 're done cooking, and we 'll just cook these until they 're nice and fork tender, my lamb mixture has been cooking, for about six to eight minutes.
i think you can see here.
there 's a quite a bit of fat, and i 'm going to drain that off, so now.
we 're ready to add minced.
garlic will just read that in there and spread that all around the best you can get it to the heat.
so it mellows out that flavor, and we 're going to let this sate here for just about a minute.
and then we 're going to add the rest of our spices now.
i 'm using a quarter of a teaspoon, and you can do as much as this is, you like so here 's the cinnamon.
first years are coming to do the same thing and turmeric, turmeric is such a healthy spice guys i try and sneak it in whenever i can.
and this is a great recipe for this.
add a little bit of my chicken broth that 's just going to help liquefy the spices and make sure that they distribute pretty well, stir that around, and i 'm probably going to give it a taste 'cause.
i want to see if i want more spice now.
it 's time to add my zucchini an the peas zucchini and peas.
do n't take very long to cook?
so i 'm going to cover this pot, keep it on low and just keep everything nice and hot until ready to assemble are potatoes, are done?
and i 'm separating them into two bowls, like i mentioned earlier.
so want to heat up your coconut milk and butter together, which i 'm going to do in just a second here.
or if you 're using half and half a cream, you 're going to want to eat that up first in the microwave for just a few minutes, get it nice and hot.
so that when you add it to your potato butternut squash it does n't cool it off and everything stays nice and hot time to mashed potatoes.
alright we can start with the other one does n't matter.
we 're going to take our mixture, and we 're going to pour half of it into the potatoes and the other half into the butternut squash in this coconut milk is going to give it a nice rich flavor.
so we 'll just mash this up.
and of course, we have to add some salt, add a little bit of salt to this, go ahead and add a sprinkle to that you can do, pepper.
if you like mash, this up all right.
now that we got the mashed potatoes done we 're going to move into the butternut squash and do n't be afraid to add a little more milk to your potatoes.
it just depends, i mean, it 's not an exact science, or just get the consistency that you like.
and i 'm also going to add a little bit of cinnamon to my butternut squash.
so i 'm just going to sprinkle a little bit on there may be an eighth of a teaspoon.
i 'm going to be a little more turmeric once that 's all.
then , we 'll be able to put the whole casserole together.
alright we are ready to put this little thing together.
i 'm going to go ahead and chop up my basil.
i have n't done that.
yet i 'm going to do is just a little shifu nod where we just roll up the leaves together and just give it a nice little.
slicing up, take my butternut squash.
and we 're going to layer it into the bottom of nine by thirteen.
now i have my oven preheating to four hundred fifty four hundred degrees.
and i 'm going to first poor my butternut squash on the bottom of my dish, we 're just going to make a nice thin language sprinkled the basel into my meat mixture.
but i 'm going to go ahead and just layer this.
and i 'm going to pour it in.
but i 'm afraid that it might disturb my butternut squash.
so i 'm just going to sprinkle it on, will call it that i 've been having an interesting day today, first of all, i have no running water in my kitchen believe it or not ca n't wash dishes.
all what a shame, yeah, i had to, had to turn off the water to the house.
because a sprinkler valve broke an right in the middle of all this, and i 'm like, that 's OK, i can deal with it.
i can get this done.
problem , but the water thing i tell you, it really makes you appreciate water when you do n't have it.
we take so much for granted, i 'm spreading this on here as you can see trying to get a nice thin layer with this.
so i barely got this thing covered with the mashed potatoes, but we made it.
and you can see the three layers bottom.
we 're going to put this in the oven, four, hundred degrees.
fahrenheit for about fifteen minutes or until it 's nice and hot i just took the casserole out of the oven, and it is sizzling hot.
so i 'm gonna go ahead and serve this up.
see if i can get it out, so i have a question for you guys.
