hey , what 's up guys welcome to my kitchen.
because if you 're in college, or even after cause, you know, that your main diet is pretty much run in.
so i thought i would show you a really quick and easy cheap way to make ram, it tastes really good.
so , first, i need to go and get my ingredients, so let 's go to the asian market.
let 's go or i could just buy rocket and i 'll be done and i find the ingredients for my prom is first thing to get is the greens or it 's.
vegetables , but you can use any vegetables, but i like to use baby.
where is the greens and see i do n't need that many so we need this one 's good baby bok, choy?
the robin selection, yes, like to buy these because it comes with a bra that 's only difference in asian markets wondering best place to get.
it and it tastes better to get these ones that so is it noodles are already made noodles on the dried one is always so much better and then i gotta show you ramin and the time comes around and see these dry ones just are.
so i would avoid those next.
we want to get the meat.
i like to get like pork, belly or smoke park volume.
so the meat baguette i 'll get this wife is kind of a lot.
but often disagree that 's it, it 's that simple, OK, so, let 's get started on our meal person.
just get a pot of water boiling and started and the trick is, you do n't actually need to fill the whole pot up at wire.
if you notice if you have the problem with the pot, always boiling over when you cook ramin.
you do n't actually need too much water to boil ramin.
so there you go then put it set it to like medium.
so wait for that to boil, while we wait for that to boil.
i 'm going to start on slicing up the greens to make this bag.
so difficult to open the first thing i like to do is wash the greens, i 'm just going to use two, two of these, like this, take them apart.
and then wash them individually, is how you wash it just turn on the water just take each piece and running under the water and wipe your fingers over next?
we take our knife and chop up the baby.
bok , choy into tiny bite size pieces, check it out.
so first thing i like to do this chop off the ends and then i just like to make it diagonally, and that 's what i do time for the sped up version to try it on a frying pan.
so set that to medium.
also , we need some olive oil.
yeah , we 're just going to let the pan heat up and then stick that on there.
so what comes in these robin packs, show you.
so usually comes with two servings, which it 's like way too small.
one serving is way too small.
so i always just make two.
so it comes with the noodles that are all really nice, and it comes with the base here.
so as you can see the noodles are all really nice and soft.
super delicious bam, this cut up the roasted pork belly, so i 'm just going to freeze each piece.
and then i can this already cooked.
so i usually just stick it in the hot broth.
and then it 's like keeps it up.
this will make one two three four five six seven eight brahmins.
this is not considered boiling, i think this is ready though, so i can start making the soup base.
so what i like to do is, i do n't like to use the same water that 's in here to boil the soup base.
because the noodles have like flower and stuff on them.
so what i like to do is boil separate profit so i can get a nice clear brock at the stink.
here where i can boil water.
but you can always just boil it in another pot start.
i love the sound of cooking it always sounds.
OK , this is done.
turn it off at the side.
bam , i just sliced the char shu over here, and i put the rest in the refrigerator here.
the water looks like it 's ready.
so , stick around and inside, noodles OK.
so this is important right.
now is to make sure that you keep mixing it, or else you do n't want the noodles to stick to the bottom.
so the broader terms of these little packets here, you just open the packet super off this is soy sauce broth.
and then, you add your hot water.
yeah , that 's about enough.
see if the noodles are done perfect.
the next thing we do is straight the noodles pour cold water over it.
so this stops the cooking process are here.
and it also gets rid of all the slime that 's on the noodles.
if there 's any extra like slimer, scum, your noodle very extra, clean.
the water drain out for the add.
the noodles to soup base, yeah, now we 're going to garnish it with everything that we made.
bam , an it 's done awesome the last thing, as i add this shichimi pepper for taste to make it extra spicy and there you go, yeah, awesome look at this ramin.
so delicious, and.
so easy to make and definitely looks better than your average college run in their upgrade age.
yeah , make sure to check out my main channel flog after college.
i 'll put a link in description below.
and i 'm going to enjoy my ram.
it thanks for watching first of all what you.
need , you need energy board?
i would suggest getting like the full size when i used to try to do it on a towel it just would n't be the same proper.
ironing for it is awesome.
