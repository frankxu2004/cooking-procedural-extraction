hi , everyone, welcome to another episode of craving slob, and karina maiden, today, we 're making something that 's delicious and healthy.
the vietnamese spring roll i was introduced to this spring.
roll a couple of years ago by one of my coworkers, that practice in for pop lock, his parents used to own a vietnamese restaurant, and i was.
so taken back by the beauty of these spring rolls.
but also, by the taste that i started to make these at home, with many different fillings and my kids just love it.
now the plus point is it 's not only healthy.
also gluten-free, which today is a big plus to have my sister in law 's gluten, intolerant and i 'm always looking for recipes that i can serve when she visits me in the summer.
so let 's get started i just want to go through the ingredients really quickly i 'm going to make a very quick dipping sauce and this dipping sauce is also going to be using to use a little bit inside the spring roll just to give it a little burst of flavor.
so i 've got about two teaspoons of hoisin sauce and i 've got another two teaspoons of chili and garlic sauce and just mix these two together, now, you can also use peanut butter, peanut butter, goes really well with poison sauce.
but since i 'm sending this to my kids school for lunch i 'm going to leave out the peanut butter i 've got about a pound of regular tiger shrimp you can also use white shrimp i prefer.
my stream to be a little bit bigger.
but i just got a medium sized today, an all i do is, put it in a pan with about a tablespoon or two of water and just let it cook it does n't take a long time with a little bit of salt once that 's done i take the shrimp out and i leave it to cool.
but do n't throw the stock away.
because it has.
so much flavor even those two tablespoons of water has a lot of flavor net i add some more water to that part i cook my rice vermecelli i 've got about a couple.
so of rice vermis, ellie and that just add some additional flavor to the vermecelli.
next i 'm going to add a rugal up you can add regular letters.
but i find it arugula has a beautiful peppery taste i 'm going to add submit for freshness i 'm going to a little bit of coriander i 've got some chunks of cucumber just cut them in logs i 've got some red pepper that i 've cut into sort of large confetti pieces i 've got, julian of carrots, and i 'm going to add some crab meat.
now traditional vietnamese spring rolls uses pork belly or ham to make this completely seafood, only and.
so i think the shrimp and the crap together is a fantastic combination.
my kids love it now, lastly.
we 're going to use the rice paper.
i 've got two sizes here.
i 've got a small size and a medium sized today.
i 'm going to use a medium size, which is perfect for school lunch or snack.
but the small size is lovely to make little appetizers.
so you can choose to use whatever you want.
i 'm not going to talk too much about the quantity of ingredients today, and i 'm not too fast about it, you can use as little or as much as you like.
so i 'm simply going to just mix the two tablespoons of chili garlic sauce together with the hoi sin, you can leave this as is or you can add some freshly chopped coriander to this totally up to you just going to keep that aside and next.
i 'm going to work on the shrimp.
so here 's what you do take the shrimp down on your board.
take a really sharp knife and just cut it all the way through.
i 'm going to do this to everyone of the shrimp and you 're going to get two hubs like this.
but you 're going to local really pretty in the spring walk right now, like a big change for today is OK.
deluca flashlight lines, long as you find your way things change is open here, cut all the shrimp and put it aside, and.
now we 're going to start by suffering the rice papers.
here 's my rice paper.
it 's quite hard what you need.
is some kind of container that 's big enough to hold some warm water?
now do n't make the mistake of taking a really small container and trying to shut this thing in there.
i 've seen some people do that is, just not a good idea.
so put it in, and let it soak it only, takes literally maybe thirty seconds, or so to soften up.
and , once that 's done, i 'm going to stuff it commandant, cheated and waste my time office.
nice and soft, i 'm going to take it out, put it on my clean wooden board, which i just washed.
now we 're going to stuff it.
so the first thing that 's going to go down are the shrimp.
because i want people to be able to see it when they pick it up to eat with your eyes.
so here 's the shrimp.
going to use as many as you need, too, depending on the size of your shrimp?
my shrimp a big, i 'll use three, but these ones are a little bit smaller than i planned to use, so, i 'm going to use for them.
i 'm going to put in some arugula, you can use regular letters, but i love arugula, but adamantly a stick of cucumber.
this is going to add a nice freshness.
little bit of coriander i 'm going to put in tiny depp up.
the sauce not too much, just a little bit, some carrots i 've got some red pepper confetti, but this is quite large.
confetti , now this as a lovely color to the rules going to add a little bit of crap, and finally some rice noodles, and.
now the fun part we 're going to roll it when i try and roll it without breaking it, obviously this takes some practice.
but i 'm going to fold it in just like i fold in a spectral look how gorgeous, that is, and then i 'm going to forward over and we have a beautiful tight package that 's just bursting with flavor and i 'm going to keep going till i have quite a few done, and ready for lunch that 's, right, gangsta fairy tales.
but dreams beneath monday i 've got about ten down and, i 'm just going to keep going i 've got a fantastic momentum going.
i 've got one soaking while i 'm rolling the other one.
i 've had a few along the way.
they are just that delicious their light, and so fresh tasting.
now remember as you 're rolling it to keep wiping down your bored.
because if you 're bored gets really, what it gets very slippery and difficult to roll so.
