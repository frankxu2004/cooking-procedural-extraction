i 'm susanna williams.
this is my entry into the freedom foods.
compassionate cook competition.
it 's a rather cold gloomy day here in wales, so i 'm going to be making some of my favorite comfort food that is sausages with roasted vegetables.
and some cheesy slow cooker mash.
the great thing about this recipe is that all the preparation can be done in advance, then you just put it in the oven, go and do something else come back.
you 've got a lovely tasty hot meal, and she 's very civilized.
i 'm going to do is prepare the mush.
i 'm using russet potatoes today, which are a good all round potato.
you can boil them, roast them.
i put all my peelings in the compost bin for the garden.
next year so.
nothing goes to waste.
i cut them into even sized jumps, then i 'm going to put them in a pan of cold water and bring them to the book.
once the water is boiling, i 'm going to add a chicken stock cube and some garlic you need about a teaspoon of garlic, which is a couple of clothes.
you can crush your own, or i 'm using very lazy garlic.
it 's just a kind of girl and turn the heat down on the potatoes and boil them for about ten minutes until it just becomes self.
when they 're cooked, we 're going to drain them and mash them.
i 'm going to be using about half a part of the cream cheese.
this just makes it really creamy and cheesy.
mash until all the laws are out.
and cheat is all mixed in then.
i get my slow cooker you can put it in the slow cooker.
it 's in the creamier.
it is just make sure you put it on a low catching.
so that the cheesy potato does n't burn on the bottom.
next i 'm going to prepare the vegetables today.
i 'm using carrots and parsnips.
i 've got some red onion and my absolute favorite butternut squash.
i thought all these from a local organic farm.
since i know that there free from pesticides.
and also the carbon footprint is low because they have n't been transported all over.
everywhere , you need to peel them and chop them.
interested guests have even sizes what you 've done the vegetables get a big.
bowl , and get some.
well , i 'm using some oil infused with chili as it gives it bites a good couple of glugs of it in the bowl pepper that makes it nice.
so i 've got some chili.
and chili grinder, i 've got some herb, but this is ready chopped typic block of that on it, mix it all together and only half.
today tables into the oil.
forgot the onion, you need to make some round, so they call slowly coated next.
i 'm going to spread the vegetables.
unto , a baking tray, you need to make sure that there 's plenty of room between him and loosen, room for the sausages.
i 'm using cumberland pork sausages with the RSPCA endorsed freedom foods logo.
i believe all animals have the right to live stress free, and follow their natural behavior patterns.
it 's time we were concerned about the quality of animal living conditions, and mental health and not.
just about the quantity of meat we can produce on farms because healthy happy animal gives us healthy happy food.
so i 'm going to take the sausages.
i 'm going to put them on trays and then i 'm going to drizzle the last bit of oil over the top going to put these in the oven, seven, hundred degrees centigrade or.
thus gas marks you need to cook the vegetables and the sausages for about thirty to forty minutes till there, nice and brown, and you need to turn them over about half way through the cooking time, till it, lee brown, evenly all over smells delicious look at that perfect for a winters day.
