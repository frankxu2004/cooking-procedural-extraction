good evening folks is glenda ball shelf there night.
i 'm going to put together my famous buffalo chicken wing recipe.
they want to use back to the restaurant, and we serve thousands and thousands of these wings they taste delicious with football season of bonus, the great finger food for the game for picnic for whatever occasion you might have to show you how to put this classic easy recipe together in just a few steps.
so let me show you how we do it.
typically , when you get your chicken wing he purchased from the store.
three states is to it.
the drum at the wing section in that.
what i guess is like the chicken to or whatever it is.
i cut right off there, then i find the joint.
and that will produce the chicken wing and the drum at what we 'll do, is we 're going to put together order about twenty of these?
so i 'll repeat this process and prop up my chicken wings.
OK , i 've now cut up my twenty wings into the drumettes and to the wing sections as you can see.
i 've used one night for that and.
traditionally , buffalo wings are served with both celery and carrot sticks, which i 've chopped up these sticks using a completely different cutting board and completely different knife.
'cause i do n't want any cross contamination than what i typically do is i take my carrot sticks and my celery sticks.
and i put him into a water and just to basically chrisman.
up while i 'm cooking the wings and.
this , this will just give them a nice little snap.
and the next step here is going to be to actually fry the chicken wings off.
so we 're going to go to that.
next when it comes to chicken wings, you 'll see a lot of people either batter there chicken wings for the buffalo wings, or they just fry them.
but you kind of a little bit different twist on that for an order of twenty i will put in about a tablespoon of baking powder, a teaspoon of crushed black pepper and three quarters of a tablespoon of just break their sea salt and just basically coat these wings up not really battered.
but it basically gives them a nice christmas.
and then i usually just let these set up for about ten, fifteen minutes.
so that i 'm not throwing him into the hot oil ice cold, and will just let these sit out here for.
i said about ten minutes get the oil up and i 'll show you how to fridays off alright.
now what you want to do is take about three cups of cooking oil and they 're going to put these chicken wings in here on high heat up.
you want to do is make sure that while you 're cooking your chicken wings, shirley 's around a little bit.
so they do n't stick, together, you do n't speak to the bottom to the very thoroughly coated in the oil.
once the three heavies up the heat.
and we 've had these sitting out for a ten fifteen minutes there.
not ice cold.
and you see the oil really has n't stopped.
but we want to make sure that we bring that oil back up the heat.
once we have the oil back up to high, then we want to cut it back to about medium high.
so that we thoroughly cooked the wings throughout.
so that you do n't have rare centers on them.
very , very key yet cooking in a manner, such that the exterior of the wing is nice and crispy what, we 're going to do.
now we 're going to prop up the sauce for the buffalo wings themselves.
really start out with about a tablespoon of butter does make the wings just give him a nice softap, taste to them.
there 's a lot of different hot sauces you can use.
you can use sarachi back to the restaurant, people wanted, you know, that sell these wings are hot enough, i put some of this pure cap, which has five hundred scoville units in it and i could just about knock somebody added to the weed, with this stuff that we 're making this for probably normal gas.
and what i like to use is just franks red hot.
this is just a nice hot cross, and i put in about three tablespoons of back into the fry pan here?
now do that i 'd like to add some vinegar.
but he tablespoons we want to cook that off.
so that we get rid of all the, the acidity in the vinegar and to this mixture, as that facilities coming off of the sauce.
we 're going to give this just the keys of diane just about god all that vinegar off, and then what we want to do is take some riddle hines.
they made a catch up, and i 'll put about three tablespoons of that into the sauce.
stir that around something like that.
i 'll hit it with the wings and thoroughly coat link now with the force.
can you get your wings thoroughly?
cut it up all you can do then he 's played him up gay.
we 've got our buffalo wings.
all played it up here.
we 've got these served up with some blue cheese, dressing you could also use a ranch dressing whatever your taste preference says, we 've served them up with the traditional celery and carrot sticks, and they are.
now ready to serve you probably want to serve these with a small plate.
so that the people can put the wings onto the plate.
let 's take one of these wings out here, give it a try.
see how spicy did nice crisp wing not too spicy.
i think it 's just spot on today, the truth hey, it 's clean, the ball shep, thanks for watching and is always bone apatit.
