today , we 're going to be making our boudin noodles here.
we have some dried food on it 's a long, flat chinese noodle.
and it cooks up really nicely.
in fact, it 's really nice and hardy and holds really, well, you can see.
i 've got some here already cooked, you can hold this in your refrigerator and it does really.
well , we 're going to be making it today with some oven, dried tomatoes.
some red onions, kalamata olives and grilled eggplant.
this is a really good representation of our restaurant here combining chinese and mediterranean ingredients to round out all parallel thirty three here.
so the way i 'm going to start his first with my noodles into some hot water make sure my pan is on a nice and hot start with a little canola oil garlic, and ginger.
i 'll get that into the pan.
then i 'll add my onions tomatoes eggplant, and call matt olives.
add a little bit of salt important to really let this get.
and i saute going so that all the flavors get released into the noodles, and it really helps it from not being quite so bland this point.
i 'm going to add my fresh spinach.
this is a really good technique that you can use for anytime.
you 're sauteing, spinach to really healthy and light way to cook it.
i 'll add it to the pan, just let it get a little bit warm, and if i was n't using noodles i can use about a quarter cup of water and it really wilt.
the spinach really nicely.
and hope to retain its flavor and its shape.
so here we 're just going to use the good on noodles that i had get to adam to the pan.
i 'm gonna let that spinach, wilt just a little bit.
i had a little bit of feta cheese number.
feta has a lot of salt in it.
so you 're really going to want to be careful about how you 're salting the dish from the beginning.
the noodles included a little bit of parsley, this dish is really fast and really simple.
once you have all the ingredients set up and ready to go take the noodles.
i like to go noodles first to kind of create a bed down there.
we give it a little twist just so we can add a little bit of height to the bowl is important in the restaurant, but not so important.
if you 're cooking at home, OK, i like to kind of move the vegetables around.
so that the whole plate is covered with a lot of these nice, fresh vegetables will add a little bit more feta cheese.
and some parsley there.
you have it this is parallel thirty threes.
mediterranean boudin noodles.
