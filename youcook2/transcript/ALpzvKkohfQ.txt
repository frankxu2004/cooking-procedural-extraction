once again to have great food dot com on the menu today, some mutton curry i 've got some lovely chunky martin.
here , if must be a bone in there, and everything.
it 's just it works wonders like this and get all the juice out of that OK.
i 've got up earlier with a touch of oil.
i 'm using the corn oil, not the first thing i want to do is i want to drop here now.
lamb , or mutton.
i 'm about any spices does n't spices.
i just want to cook this for that real four minutes.
i just want to put a lid on that and ground it up a bit.
and then i 'll be back.
see you then.
OK , so i turned the heat down.
because it can get quite lively and that was just the plumbing is just sort of see little bit and.
because we got.
so much foam in here.
let 's take a long time to cook.
you 've got a pressure cooker.
this is probably the best way to this is going to take a long time for us to cook this monitor will slow cook up.
OK , now we 're going to do let me out, but the salt i 've got some famous.
i 've got my drive whole gallon.
this is going to go in.
i 've got human seeds, mustard seeds.
kardum and chocolate coriander seeds and some clothes surrender release the oils from each of the seeds that would use that oil already, now, i 'm going in with if you can get these are great.
i 've got fresh curry, leaves the absolutely wonderful.
but the kids difference.
now some powders what i called the big four equal parts coriander cumin, tumeric or how deep and chili powder to let us get there all pattern in there.
now i 'm also guy name is some fresh chili green chili and as much yours into, as you wish here.
garlic , ginger paste, which is fifty, fifty garlic, and ginger mixed together.
finally , finally, charts awesome chopped onion.
i 'm using the red onion.
i just prefer them really this slightly stronger, OK, we can turn the heat up on this now and what we want to do.
is we just want to give this a little mix on a hike EXE?
make sure all that masila whether it be the fresh leaves, the powders, order seeds, coats, our meats garlic jim 's going to work wonders in there as well, select the lids going to go back on.
i 'm going to turn the heat down slightly.
i 'm going to cook this for about ten minutes.
OK just take a look absurd.
this , a couple of times already now, we 're at the point now where we could get any longer.
we 're going to start to burn these onions, and so.
but we are way off finished.
so sad a little bit of water.
so had the water too early.
otherwise your powders and spices would n't have done their job and nail tastes really dry assisted in last bit of moisture, there listening to go back on the heat 's fairly low.
so you in ten, OK this jump in now and take a look looking fantastic, that alter slightly reducing now.
i 'm going to go in with some chopped tomatoes.
it is a little mix around it now.
you 've got a pressure cooker, and you 're going to save lots of time with this, i mean, pressure cookers are just really great with anything chunky like this, and the bone it really kind of tenderize it quite quickly.
so you 've got one of those.
you 're going to save a whole lot of time.
i 'm just showing you this way today because a lot of it i 'm happy.
i 've had a few emails normally.
i would do this in it 's pressure cooker.
OK , now i 'm going to do is get the lid back on the heat is fairly low.
i 'm going to cook this for about ten minutes.
we want those tomatoes to completely breakdown and create our masada.
we might add a little touch more water, but let 's see, see you in awhile OK.
let 's have a look because as you can see the tomatoes have broken down really nicely.
we are going to need a little bit more liquid in that, but let me drop some water, and i 've got some cold water here now.
you ca n't really over cook this dish.
you want this meat to be incredibly tender.
i 'm going to throw in some fresh coriander now, which has a beautiful flavor, is that a stir check your one for salt?
now you might need to add a touch more.
so i 'm not a great sort fan now as i say you could put this one over ten minutes or another hour.
it depends on you 'll meet, so you need to keep checking your meat so it 's lovely.
and tender you want that kind of need to fall off the bone.
really , so, depending on your meat is how long you 're going to cook this dish for now, turning the heat in really low.
really , really low mileage.
going to go back on, i think mine is going to be fifteen minutes.
hope you enjoy it will see you again soon.
