so they 're going to make a classic traditional fish and chips with one of my favorite fish caught the first thing we need to do is to get the chips on.
you want to send them for about five minutes ago in training and then call naturally in the air before we frighten the best thing to do is to do that a couple of hours before i just think.
it 's nice, have a nice drive ship before you put it into the fryer, you getting lovely crispy finish.
so put the potatoes into the water cold water.
the reason for that, if you put them into hot boy anymore, say and all the potatoes breaking and still raw in the center looked right through next.
we gotta, do is make the title source and the first thing you need to do is to make a classic mayonnaise now?
mayonnaise is our emotions and basically it means you 're emulsifying egg yolk with acid.
and we 've oil, and you have to make sure you do it slowly at first, have always you will split the ingredients, so farting, discreetly, regs now.
we got there is free egg yolks.
and we need to type are english mustard and a couple of batches of white wine vinegar.
now the whiskey by hand is, quite an arduous job.
so to help you best thing to do is to go tea towel, inform yourself a little circle and that hold the bowl in place that gives you a free hand to put your oil in.
so slowly, we add the oil a few drops at a time.
if you were to split it basically, take this split ingredients get a fresh egg.
yolk , and put it into a new bowl, a statue dealdash vinegar and then start the whole process, again added to split mixture, and you 'll have success of freshly are multiplied mayonnaise.
so that 's all the oil incorporated.
what you 're looking for is consistency of very thick custard.
if you like a little bit of freaking out more oil.
if you like a little bit of see lucy just had less oil.
so , once you get your mayonnaise made, and you got it a consistency you like next thing we need to do.
chop , the capers and the girl pins and then get the herbs in there, which is a tarragon.
the chervil, the policy and the chives, though, at all them into the mayonnaise, sometimes when you add the ingredients to mayonnaise the vinegar will let the mayonnaise down.
so you may ask that a little bit more onto it.
so at this point, we just had our season i saw and pepper.
so most important part is to taste that our source, and if you happy with it, get it in the fridge until we 've finished cooking.
so while she making its outsource, keep an eye on your chips when you insert a knife.
is just a little bit of software you still wanna little bit furnace area as well, when you get to that stage it 's hard for about six minutes going to take them off, drain them and put them onto a tray to cool down this thing is the beer batter.
so we 've got our flower?
we got some sugar.
we got some fresh yeast who also got some doing barbie, which is my, well, my favorites you can use love.
you could use any other bieber doing boston maine.
so first thing you do is at the flower, and this you go, let me go up crumbling are fresh yeast.
and then gently.
we had the beer and what you 're after is nice smooth batter.
if you had it all the beer once you would n't get a chance, we may have paste for.
so you 're after pace before you add it or whether you end up with lumps.
so finally, we had a little bit of salt touch of pepper.
then we cover that with a tea towel and leave it for ten minutes before we cook with it the reason, why i like card for fish and chips is has lovely white, flaky, purdy sort of flesh and it works very, very well.
fish and chips.
so this is how you may get your fish.
are in the fishmongers.
so this stage you will still have the skin on it, you 'll still have a few pin bones in their these pin bones, you really want to remove.
because they will get stuck in your throat.
so an easy way to do that, is not just struggle with a para pliers is actually to cut them out and proficient chips?
that 's perfectly acceptable and to skin it.
i 'll just show you now.
the easiest way is just to come along the center where the, where the bones are right.
so as you can see you still got the skin on there.
but what you 've got is something workable.
so life in at the end to this skin and there you have the skin at the bottom and all you need to do is firmly hold onto the bit.
you wait where you 've cut do n't move it and use the sharp knife.
come all the way along the philip right.
so then what you 've got is a lovely glowing.
if card is she.
now can portion of the efficient chips.
so the bottom side, which is the belly of the fill it just have to remove all this like a sinew is the actual inside of the belly, which is not very nice to eat.
so we remove that.
and then, the bones are still in there so we just need to find where the bones are using you, sharpen.
i 've come along the center again.
she cuts in their bones, out and then the same as we did before.
just cuts in at the bottom bring a knife along holding onto this skin and let the knife do the work.
you got four nice pieces out of one philip, the efficient chips all those trimmings that you got leftover do n't from away stick 'em in the freezer when you 've got enough.
make yourself a lovely fish pie.
so we got my fish ready so the first thing you do is get your chips into the fryer.
we want to get in colored, uh, first of all, you 're going to be struggling for a room in your deep fat fryer that fries hot one hundred and eighty degrees.
now will steal them off for about for the full minute.
so they can start to color out before we take them out.
and , then course, lately we put the fishing you off the chips are cooking performance will get on with the card, please take up answer which has been resting for about ten minutes, and then we 'll get some flower little bit of soul in there at such a pepper and then just pass your card flip through the flower knock off any axis.
you do n't want any layers of raw flower in there, and then into the batter.
so the chips have been coloring off now for about four minutes, so will take them out, and let them drain.
now you put the code in leave the call in there for about for two minutes, and then we turn them over and cook it for another three or four minutes before we had the chips back in and then hopefully we 'll come over tonight and, golden brown.
because about three or four minutes away now.
so i grab the chips back in just to finish them off and he even got deep fat fry even simply just breadcrumb the fish put it through some flour egg and bread crumbs and then shallow fry in a hot pan and you get roughly the same result.
but it is worth kennedy fat fire.
because fish and chips is all about the deep fryer firstly, do that little bit of salt train, a puppy 's where do lemon accord, beautiful crispy chips are peas and lovely thick tartar source and they have it, that 's my cotton sheets were tired to source and fresh peas.
