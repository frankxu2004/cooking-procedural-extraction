yeah , hi, thanks for watching this video.
we 're going to make a california roll and first, we need to succeed with this is half the shit that normally comes this is the way they can use it on the social works , OK.
so we put the series this way and you put some water on our hands so the rise does n't stick.
then make sure, do n't put too much water?
otherwise , the labrae swirled observe it, and fall apart.
just whatever you need to do the shape of a tamali of the sushi rice and spirit spread all over this way.
satin sheets to it, then we have a naked, but this will be good enough.
we have a wet towel so the price does n't stick to our cutting board as you can see in next.
we gotta put a couple slices of avocado couple slices of cucumber.
we have power crab, salad.
hey , there is a video in my channel, and how to make this, or you can just put strips up imitation crab king crab.
but i recommend you to do this , mix.
these are some mail in sesame E oil and give us a very good flavor to it.
internet some of that and put it right in the middle.
not too much because otherwise you would have a room to grow that water in our hands there.
we gonna get this corner and everything with our finger, so we can roll it.
did you go this way and make sure there is the other age?
still room in there so you can roll it up once you roll it.
you have a piece of classic rock put it on top.
so our so the one who does n't stick to it we had never boo right here and i 'm gonna push this we have this tom in a finger on the corners then this one right in the middle at the same time, you gotta push the fish right in the middle only everything will come up so.
but the corners wish it then we got a square, square one, you could also like the ages watt switch then we have a nice square draw to cut it we gonna put some water in our life.
so the riser, sadistic to it gonna slice right in the middle do the same thing with the other pieces.
so we can have eight equal, sizes this is california around already that you can put some more review.
one two on top again, i 'll put on a play decorate.
the way you like it, and i hope you like this recipe.
thank you so much.
