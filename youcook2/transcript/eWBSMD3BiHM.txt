it so, we thought picky that green curry paste, here debate, this comes from the lemongrass you get in the market cedar at you to take the roots of it.
how do n't get the root supplies?
they 're difficult to get to the market, so you use what you the thick part is available otherwise cut the grass very fight lee at that boil.

you can use it the lemongrass.
the main taste easier is a really good fresh card.
yet add a few chopped onions.
very few, garlic green chilies, koriander see QVC black pepper powder little bit, a piece of teacher salt, demented the green color had leverage and the lemon pete.
there are lots of things are not clear, we have not used here because they are not easily available.

and this is quite a lot you can store it in your fridge.
use it whenever you want it, so let 's start picking.
the thai fried rice, you all of, you know, very well, the rice has to be cold it has to be separate, is really important, here.
if the rice is hot, the cut is not going to come hard way it high or chinese cooking.
the rice has to me.

i started and let 's start doing it.
so heat the oil fried chopped again when you could use plain aliens or spring lettuce.
but spring, given under giving him medication, so, whatever is available with you, you use it now.
i 've added baby called this is fire boy and a few capsicum.
we 're going to add a few spring onion leaves in the beginning and later also, which seems a little colorful nice color.
so we 're going to add a few green chilies.
also add the curry face around two tablespoons.
it 's to your liking, two papers, but OK right again, but do n't cry too much, and now i 'm going to act cook.
right salt little paper, it has got light green color here the third source is little.
often you can add very little size, you know, why i 'm talking like this.
it 's a market mainly over ideas of firth, authoring summers very dark in color very light and color, so, if it is dark in color useless is light.
so i sauce that use more it depends on the quality of service of the available end of market.
so , now right is right.
so our green rise, i told you it 's ready what i 've done.
i packed the rice into this ring bowl, which is available easily in the bucket when you can serve it as it is.
even if it looks pretty hindering mode and the center comes for the sauce.
