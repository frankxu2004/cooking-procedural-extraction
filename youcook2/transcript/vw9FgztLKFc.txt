hi , i 'm aaron and today, i 'm going to be making one of my favorite pub foods, escargot stuffed mushroom caps.
it is simple and easy meal to make, and it 's delicious, it 's actually more of an appetizer.
then a meal, but it 's definitely if you have it with some bread, or some shit will be a delicious meal.
so i 've already started to preheat my pan and preheat my oven.
so i 'm going to add a splash of spanish olive oil to the bottom of my pan just kind of swallowed around that going to add half of a sweet onion quarter.
cup diced and i 'm going to start with a tablespoon of garlic really quick.
there do not add in a dozen mushroom caps, not going to let it cook too long.
i just wanted per minute.
now what i 'm going to do is i have some dry red wine.
this is a cab.
i 'm going to add a cup and a half of red wine into my pan now.
why would the dry because i do n't want the sweet flavor taking away from the dish this is some fresh thyme?
i 'm adding in and then i have a dozen dry, precooked, helix, escargots.
so i 'm going to add those in right away also.
so i 'm going to the mushrooms spread out around the outside of the pan.
i 'm going to turn up the heat on the pan 'cause i 'm really going to let that red wine cook down and get some concentrated flavor into it, it 's going to take about four minutes and by the time it 's done.
the mushrooms will be cooked the escargot will be hot.
the flavor of the time will be infused into the red wine, so we 'll come back in four minutes.
when this is all finished and ready to go on to the next step alright, so took six minutes so far and the sauces button completely reduced.
so we 're just left with some cooked mushrooms and largely looks snails, garlic.
so i can turn that right down, just keep cooking the sauce a little bit.
i have some mushroom dishes.
so i 'm going to start by loading the mushrooms into the mushroom dishes.
each , so try to choose mushrooms that are appropriate size for the smells that you have another.
not everyone has mushroom dishes.
you use a little plate instead, and now i 've put the snails on top of the mushrooms now.
i 'm just going to do the same for the other mushroom dish like i said i had twelve mushrooms and twelve snails.
so load those in there.
we 're almost coming off of this is fantastic.
this is a really great meal for one of those cool fall days OK.
so i 'm going to the rest of the sauce with the garlics and the onions.
i 'm going to just going to pour on top of that, you want some sauce in there.
up pull off the time and put off to the side.
we got the sauce and the onions and garlic in the mushrooms and the snake.
although there have some pre grated mozzarella cheese.
but just a little bit of feta in there just kinda wanted that extra little papa flavor from the dryness of the feta cheese going to adds a little bit of contrast, your mozzarella cheese which is really mild i do not very much.
but just a very little bit now, i just talked to enough of it to cover the mushrooms in the snails, and i have them in dishes.
so when melts it does n't get all over the oven.
so i 'm going to put this in my preheated oven, that is at four hundred and twenty five degrees it 's going to take around fifteen minutes in the sub alright we will check back in fifteen minutes and we 'll see what they 're looking like, OK.
so it 's been fifteen minutes.
the escargot is completely done.
now the sauce is nice and bubbly hot.
the cheese is all nice and melting crisp on the top.
and i 've also made some little bit of garlic toasts with focaccia bread that i made earlier today.
so that said, it took about twenty five minutes to make it total pretty easy process, and it 's very good on a nice crisp fall day.
thank you for watching.
