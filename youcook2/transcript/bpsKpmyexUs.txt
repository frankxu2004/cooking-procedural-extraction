i was n't sure, is a bit of a should i fill them, or should n't i filmed them specially quite nerve wracking, filming people.
i was actually quite nervous, and he said, oh, i 've never been on camera before, said, oh, well, i gave him a link to my youtube channel, and.
so we 're going to feature this looking to put this on youtube OK suns coming out i 've got two killers of muscles to cook.
now thanks to stage cooking and his lovely wife and they 're going to be.
let 's get back into the kitchen OK.
so now we 've got all our muscles back from our wonderful day out now, i 've cleaned them.
you want to make sure that you press them when you press them together that they actually stay together.
if they do n't, that means they 're dead and toss them out.
you have to D beard them, which means you, gotta take that funny sort of deity thing off the side here.
and you just tear that off, give them a scrub with some nice water.
and it could see this one here, is just starting to open?
we 're going to close him and just give him a few seconds, and as you can see it, if you can see that he 's already closed up again.
so that means that one is still alive.
so you need to go through.
make sure that you do n't have any deadlines in there so they affect all of those.
so i 've got some a kilo of muscles here.
and we 're just going to go over the ingredients.
and we 're going to use you 're going to need a sort of a large source burn here, and you 're going to also need a lead on top of that.
but for the ingredients, what you 're going to do is have half an onion.
i 've got three cloves of garlic, you can add more or less, if you wish.
now i did say i was going to do some coriander or use some coriander.
i 'm actually using.
some dill, which i had some beautiful deal left, but i think that 's going to really nice with the tomato over here.
and you can just use a crushed tomato or tomato sauce, or a jar source.
or you can finally chopped tomatoes if you want to, there 's a whole bunch of things you can do.
i 'm going to add just a small little knob of butter.
we 're going to put some olive oil in their first to get things moving.
and of course, chili and we 're going to top it up with some everson tape here which is a nice chardonnay into our pan we 're going to put some oil.
i 'm going to put about three tablespoons, and then straight in with their onion, talking that another better just give it a bit of a stair around just wanna cook.
those onions, just about halfway through now i love garlic.
i 'm adding three cloves of chopped garlic, you can add less if you like straight in with your clean muscles.
nice fresh deal save a little bit for the garnish on the top just a sprinkle, and.
so nice chili flakes in there if you had fresh chili, that would be fantastic.
hit it now with just a drizzle of white wine mash.
they begin to cook the mussels should start to open with crossed out around i 'm going to add a good couple of spoons of the crushed tomato and at four, maybe five of the crushed tomato, get that across through then put your nice tight lid on there and just cook those through, keep an eye on it.
give it a bit of a shake every now and again.
these do n't take long to cook at all.
it 's a very, very quick easy simple entree, and it just so colorful and delicious alright.
they 're looking good, then can see this starting to open.
OK , these already now, you know, when they are ready because they all sat it, open out.
so what do we do now.
is i 'm going to serve them up?
still , a pouring consistency, and you do n't want it too thick as you want it to sort of drizzle through all of those muscles.
so we 're just going to pour it over the top, finish off with a sprinkle of your fresh fennel.
so they have my chili muscles with their beautiful, gorgeous dill drizzle through there with some garlic little bit of olive oil splash of wine, these muscles, fresh today.
and you saw where they came from.
and it 's an absolute look at that.
does n't look gorgeous absolutely perfectly cooked.
