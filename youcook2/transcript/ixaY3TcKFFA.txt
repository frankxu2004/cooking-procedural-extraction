hi guys, it 's up here in this video, i 'm gonna show, you guys.
how to make my asian fried chick in it 's just like any other fried chicken recipe.
accept it uses more asian ingredients an like with most american fried chicken.
they usually soak the chicken in buttermilk, or maybe in a saltwater brine, and that 's just the real main difference with asian fried chicken versus.
your american fried chicken, this is a collaboration video with rosie over it.
recipes she has a really great collection other than food, so food yummy food you guys are going to love it there.
and in her video, she 's going to show you guys how to make her southern red beans, an right which is a great side dish to have with my asian fried chick in, i know, y'all cambodians, you 're like where is the papaya salad at where the sticky rice that.
but , you know, what you gotta, switch it up a little bit and make you like a little more exciting break up the same old monogamy.
what 's your daily eating routine.
is OK, that 's all i 'm saying try, i 'll post the link to her recipe, along with her youtube channel at the end of the video, and also down in the description box?
let 's start frying up some chick in where is my two pounds of chicken that i 've cleaned and pat it dry.
so i 've cut them up just like this.
i got my little drumstick piece here or drumettes get that little wing part here.
now i 'm going to go ahead and add in my soy sauce, two teaspoons.
no need, about three tablespoons oyster sauce.
so there 's one three a little bit of black pepper.
i 'm also going to add in some sugar.
so a teaspoon of sugar mix to combine gonna mix it all together, and i 'm going to let this sit at room temperature for half an hour while the chicken is marinating.
we 're going to go ahead and work on our flour mixture.
so i have her three tablespoons of all purpose flour, you need three tablespoons of potato starch in three tablespoons of rice flour.
two pinches of salt two teaspoons of garlic powder, two teaspoons of onion powder, one tablespoon of cajun, seasoning quarter teaspoon of white pepper.
finally , quarter teaspoon of black pepper so i have everything that i need to do here.
but i did forget to show you guys.
two things forgot to add half a teaspoon of italian sealer that italian seasoning which consists of like your rosemary sage, thyme all that jazz tastes really great with the fried chicken.
also going to add a little bit of chili powder quarter teaspoon of that.
it 's not going to make it to overly spicy.
but i steven, that had like a little bit of a nice kick, kind of like a background spicy note.
so i have here, my chick in going to mix it all with my hands here, your hands are your best pools.
so the trick here to not get too overly crazy.
messy is to have one hand in your dry ingredients and one hand in your chick in 'cause.
if you mix it too, it starts to get clumpy and messy that it gets kind of too messy for me.
so i 'm going to take my left hand.
throw it in my mixture, and i 'm just going to do a couple out of time.
so ten is always going to stay out of the flour mixture tap off the excess, turn this one over top off the excess that one.
so here 's what your chick is going to look like.
so , i 'm just going to go check on my oil.
then we can fridays baby the, so i 'm going to check if the oil is hot the good old asian way.
i 'm going to dip the end of my truck.
sick , middle here.
and if you see little bubbles form around it that means my oil is quite enough to fry my chicken.
if you do n't do it this way, obviously you can use a thermometer.
i would say about three fifty is good for this look at that mine and does n't that look amazing, now.
it 's time to taste, smells so good looks so good think about it damn.
it sorry guys.
my neighbor is cunning and mowing their lawn right now.
so if it gets kind of loud in my bag wow it 's good just to seriously delicious spoon, a little bit everything spell genus slightly sweet a little bit spice not to be spicy really and i can almost, i think that 's a weed wacker and that cajun seasoning as a nice little bit of color, too.
because of the paprika in it wow, all.
now dipped in some sweet chilli sauce.
this beats going out to eat or drink red chicken anytime, do n't forget to check out my friend rosie over?
