hello , everyone good afternoon, please welcome too easy steps of indian punjabi style cooking.
i 'm going to make a roti, chapati or tortilla.
i 'm gonna show, you both ways wanted the traditional way.
where is no electronic equipment or anything involved and i 'm going to show you how to do it?
i 'm just going to roll up my sleeve, and you get water.
i 'm using, uh, flower movie flow are you at water and just mix it up.
this one is pretty much done and other hand.
and with your knuckles, you roll it up and ask if i can close him, and you measured it goes off, and then you can bring it down, and then you lift it up and put it again, then you work on other way around one way and let me show you the other ways.
he is already done.
let me show you the other way.
yeah , hi, this is what we did by hand.
i 'm gonna show.
you , by the machine since we have all these machines to do the work for us, not that we got lazy.
but actually they do outperform humans.
and they do better job.
and i have the flower in the machine.
so i 'm going to bring the water according to and i 'm going to just put it at speed one, and i 'm slowly, slowly.
i 'm going to add water.
so is gonna do the job so it 's almost a one glass of water, and i add a little bit olive oil not too much very level.
who is almost ready.
van is going to become like a ball that gives you indication.
it 's already, already and we 're going to pull it out.
yeah , the doors already i 'm going to the door is ready.
this is the world.
we did by hand, this is what we did by machine.
so i 'm going to show you how we gonna do this, you get a flower, you put your finger in, there.
so basically you 're coding your fingers towards their wants stick to it though.
and roll it off, and once you roll it up, it becomes like this, then you take the ball into the euro key.
then you would just add a little bit flower again.
and you do it the twitters menu, using the roller that we use you roll it slowly.
if you roll it slowly, if you notice that the door itself is a started to turn.
so when it 's a turning is automatically should go like turning and it becomes wrong shape.
you got your grilled off, and you put it in, there.
how do you color gonna change once, once it 's gonna be a little bit?
the color get gonna change, then you, gonna put your finger underneath we 're gonna turn.
it around fingers, you know, they are very delicated.
they get try to bonnie, you can use the like a special law.
so , once you see is done on other side then you can use the same pattern.
you go like this slowly.
we see hard, coming up hard beautiful, see how it turned out.
so you 're going to rotate little bit around this will perfect even though you go visit to the restaurants you wo n't find it like this kind of roti see.
