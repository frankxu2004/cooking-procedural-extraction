hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with how to blueberry pancakes.
we always get a ton of food wishes for breakfast recipes, and it 's come to my attention that many of you are not doing blueberry pancakes properly.
so let me show you what i consider to be the ultimate method for blueberry pancakes.
and while we 're doing this, i 'll explain why the other methods are n't.
is good, so step one?
you 're going to make a batch of your favorite pancake batter.
we have several on the blogs that are fantastic.
so check those out, and you 're going to later that into a preheated, skillet.
my packages on medium high and his reforming that you 'll probably notice.
there are new blueberries in the batter.
we 're going to do is place them on top and by place, i mean, throw down wind up from like a foot away and throw them down.
i want deep impact.
i want them embedded into the batter just like that.
so right off the bat using this method, you 're going to get perfect blueberry distribution because you 're controlling where they go.
and , if you 're thinking, why do n't you just put him in the batter?
that does n't work, is good?
first of all, those berries mixed in evenly you 're probably overmixing your batter lately in the blueberries will settle.
and then some pancakes will have like twenty blueberries, some only have.
my brunch gasket up SAT words.
are exchanged hands are thrown long story short?
you 're out of the will.
so , this is a much safer method.
you 're going to go ahead and throw down as many blueberries as you like.
and yes, i 'm just doing one for filming purposes.
but even if you have a large skillet with four pancakes going they 're going to take two or three minutes before the ready to turn.
so you have plenty of time to throw down your blueberries when you get down to those last couple open spots, you can push him in growing is the most fun part of the project, and by the time your blueberries are placed your pancakes should be ready to flip.
and , you know, the signs, the edge of the pancake starts to look cooked and dry and those bubbles will come up to the surface.
so at that point we 're going to flip it over.
and then besides perfect distribution as we talked about earlier the real magic to this method is the direct contact of the blueberries to the skillet.
so , instead of them being insulated by the batter and just sitting in the middle of that pancake just barely getting warm in a couple minutes it takes to cook this side of the pancake.
those blueberries are getting hot, sweet.
they 're getting juicy which is just not going to happen is easily if they 're stuck in the middle of the batter, i mean, a couple might be touching the bottom.
but using this method.
they 're all getting sweet.
and you see so, i think it works much, much better than mixing them into the batter, and of course, if you want to show off your hot and juicy berries you can leave it facing up like that put on your butter and syrup.
but i 'm kind of a purist.
i 'm going to put my over.
clean it up.
of course, i 'm going to pull down a little more butter that melted, and some maple syrup and then as we cut in you 're going to see perfect blueberry distribution.
but more importantly, you can see that blueberry juice, mixing with the serp.
i 'll say one last time.
the berries are hot there.
juicy and their sweet.
so , anyway, just a quick and easy tutorial on how to properly blueberry pancake do not make some into the batter.
this works much better.
not only does every pancake have the same number of blueberries, using this method, each forkful, has about the same number of blueberries and by the way, you restaurants that are just dumping blueberries on top of pancakes and calling them blueberry pancakes free pancakes those are pancakes.
so that does n't count blueberry pancakes have blueberries in them and when it comes to blueberry pancake integration, you ca n't go wrong with this method.
so i really hope you give it a try head over to food wishes, dot com, for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual, and as always enjoy.
