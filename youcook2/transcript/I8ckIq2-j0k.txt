it is uhm highlight, an today on hilah cooking.
we are making fish and chips super crispy.
the crispiest fish and chips you 'll ever eat just like this served in the old england just like probably sherlock holmes.
A , except definitely better.
because i 'm making them and i 'm making him with love damn it i 'm going to start with chips part, and i 've got some russet potatoes here that i cut up about this size.
i like him about as thick as my finger in about twice as wide.
but that 's a little bit, you know.
it 's, it 's up to you.
some people like him bigger like steak fries.
but i think that 's a little too much.
so they 've been soaking in cold water for about thirty minutes, and i 'm just going to drop him off on a clean towel.
the soak in the water helps make him really chris because it draws out some of the excess starch on the surface.
so , then just sort of kind of the same trick that you use like, if you 're making cheese and stuff like that.
so i want to roll it up in a towel and give it a little squish, just to get all the water off good deal and we can kind of just set those aside for.
now and make our fish fry batter for that i 've got some flower and some baking powder salt and pepper i 'm going to add a little bit of cayenne pepper totally optional and a little bit of dill and honestly you do n't really taste this it, just looks really pretty in the final product.
but you could totally skip it or if you wanted to add any other spices of your choosing that 's fine maybe some curry powder would even be a fun little variation then, i 'm just got, some plain old soda water you could use beer.
but i 'm using soda water and, this is sort of like a tempura batter and then it 's just basically water and flour and then we 're going to add in a couple of ice cubes some recipes you 'll see, at egg to the better.
but i think that, that makes it a little bit chewy i like this.
because it 's definitely very light and crisp.
and that 's what i like.
and my fish and chips, but i guess it 's a personal preference that looks about right.
and i 'm just going to add in a couple ice cubes.
that 's going to help keep it cool this side, while our oil heats up waiting.
for oil to heat up to three thirty, so i 'll let you guys know when that happens OK.
so you just sit tight.
so our oil is hot about three thirty or potatoes or dry.
so we can go ahead and do the first frying in this first time we 're just trying to cook the potatoes are not really trying to brown am.
so we 're just going to put in the potatoes, anne let him cook for about two minutes, or until like the all the sizzling kind of subsides a little bit and do n't overload it too much.
so maybe handful potatoes at a time not that you should use your hands to put things in boiling oil couple minutes later you can see our oil for the potatoes is not quite as furiously boiling as it was only first dropped him in and the potatoes are soft there.
a little getting a little brown.
but this is n't the crisping step yet.
so we 're just going to let him drain here and then turn oil back up to let it get up to like three sixty five or so.
then , we 'll do the fish in the second fry of the potatoes.
oils hot up to three sixty five.
i 've got some fish that i cut just a little bit bigger than the potato pieces.
i 'm using a barramundi, which is an australian fish that i am new to.
but so many recommended it on instagram, so thanks, but i really like it.
but you can use anything dogfishes very traditional.
but card is also good.
when i was in new zealand we have like five or six different types every day that just whatever was in fresh, and you could take your pick.
so just dip your little fish.
i 'm going to use my fingers.
do as i say, not as i do, do n't use your fingers?
danger and again you do n't.
wanna , overload, it.
so just fry a couple of pieces at a time and these will be ready when the fish kind of starts to float and the breading.
it 's nice and brown and again kinda waiting for that oil.
sizzle to subside OK, so the sizzling has subsided and there nice and brown strain him a little bit there and then, these are.
so , so hot i 'm going to let them cool for here.
minute , while i do the second fry on these potatoes, and it 'll be fine like the fish will still be plenty hot by the time, these potatoes are done.
just let him go for about a minute until they look really.
nice and brown and oil again is up to about three sixty five anna potatoes, are done super brown and crisp so excited about this?
you guys way more excited than i should be for health purposes.
all right and then, while everything still hot we want to sprinkle it with a little more salt, you can also use the same batter.
the fish batter to do like fried mushrooms, or zucchini slices even done eggplant chunks.
it 's all delightful alright now.
usually , these are served with malt vinegar, but my skanky old grocery store does n't carry it.
so i 've got some tartar sauce that i made up with some homemade aioli, and i 've put the recipe in a link to that, and then the aioli will be up.
next thursday or this coming thursday or whatever sometime in the future, and i 'm going to do a little bit of a lemon squeeze though.
so crispy on my god.
can you hear that, that crunch, oh, my god, i 'm?
so excited, oh, my god so crunchy and so moist and just perfectly cooked.
this is better than any fish and chips that you will ever buy in a restaurant or a bar or pub or anywhere i promise you.
so i hope you try this recipe, and if you have any questions or comments, leaving below and i 'll respond as soon as i can and remember, if you ever take any pictures of any of the food that you make from my recipes, you can always put him on instagram, hashtag, hilah cooking, and it will go straight to the website, or you can post them on facebook or the new google plus community for highly cooking.
