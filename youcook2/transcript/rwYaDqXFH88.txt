are you looking for an over the top burger experience, if you are you comment to the right place today, i 'm making a blue cheese?
stuffed burger with a red pepper mayonnaise sauce sort of like special sauce, but with red peppers.
it 's really delicious, i 'll get to that in a few minutes.
but first i 'm making my burger mix.
i 'm dividing a piece of blue cheese into eight pieces.
this could be any kind of cheese that you want bree would work, cheddar would work etc, etc.
so i 've divided, my blue cheese into eight pieces, you may notice i 'm wearing gloves, i 'm just doing that.
because blue cheese does have kind of a strong, if you are concerned about that on your hands where para gloves also going to be touching meat.
and then i wo n't have to wash my hands here.
i have three pounds of meat.
it 's ground chops to that.
i 'm going to add a tablespoon of coarse salt.
if you 're using fine salt, or if you 're using a particularly salty brand of coarse salt, use a teaspoon and a half to two teaspoons also going to season the meat with a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper.
normally when i 'm making burgers, i do n't season the meat at all, except for with salt and pepper as i 'm cooking it.
so this one is a little bit special.
because i actually am pudding right in the burger.
now add two tablespoons plus two teaspoons of worcestershire sauce worlds.
hardest word to say very delicious great depth of flavor mommy.
what we 're doing is giving our burgers a little bit of a steakhouse flavor 'cause A one has a flavor that 's sort of similar.
so , well, that 's what we 're doing with the blue cheese, etc.
you get the rest two tablespoons, plus two teaspoons and then mix everything together, you do n't want to overwork meet, which is one of the reasons why i generally do n't add seasonings to my burgers.
but sometimes it 's just nice to have that flavor, right.
when i fancied up sometimes this is your fancy but easy burger.
mix it all together make sure that all the seasonings are well distributed throughout your meat, then divide your meat into eight mounds.
this is enough for eight burgers.
you want to make sure that there 's sort of evenly divided before you pack them into your burgers.
so do the dividing first once you 're satisfied that your mixture is evenly divided between all your burgers what you want to do is just shape them into your burger shape and then make a well in the center which is where you 're going to add your blue cheese to make a little hole slash, well, and just take a piece of blue cheese and put it into the center tuck.
it in folded over padded town.
no one will ever know make sure it 's nice and well enclosed otherwise as you 're cooking it.
the cheese could come out.
you might want to give people the choice of blue cheese.
and cheddar or mozzarella so make a variety of different cheeses, and then offer your friends and guests and family, a choice if you want to make these ahead.
just keep them in a single layer on a baking sheet cover with plastic in the refrigerator and you can do it in the morning.
we do it the day ahead.
i 've never done that, but you could definitely do it, morning ahead and nice firm chilled.
burgers are really easy to grill excellent.
all done gloves off to the ground picture that your grill is preheated.
nice and hot, nice and clean and give it a little brush with oil just for safety sake there 's quite a bit of fat in ground chuck.
but you never know, just be safe, be careful you can see, i 'm brushing with a hand held piece of paper towel, maybe not the best idea.
but hey, i 'm a crazy girl place the burgers on the grill you do n't need to season them there already season.
so do n't worry about that and cook them about four to six minutes per side while your burgers are cooking you can get your special sauce ready.
am i allowed to say special sauce?
maybe not, i do n't know.
i do n't care i said it anyway.
you can make your sauce right here in this food processor a cup of mayonnaise light work.
fine a quarter cup of chopped roasted red peppers half a teaspoon of white wine vinegar basically like a little more than a splash of white wine vinegar, and about an eighth of a teaspoon of pepper freshly.
if you have it regular old pepper, if you do n't.
and then, just process that up just until it combines when you have your sauce and that 's it.
there is to the sauce here ultra special extra fancy and yet very easy burger.
it 's time to flip the burgers now.
so let me go over there, get rid of this.
i do n't need it anymore.
time to flip when they 're ready to flip.
they should be nice and charred and CC to lift off of the grill if you try to slip some too soon they 'll.
stick , do n't go too early, i do n't feel like i 've completely mastered the art of hamburger, flipping our tongues, a better tool is a satchel.
a better tool i do n't know.
maybe i should try tongue.
oh , yeah, it 's better between them make sure you have clean cons.
not the ones that we use for your salami alright, three to four more minutes.
i 'm gonna play some tomatoes up, slice up a tomato or two.
make sure your knife is nice and sharp.
serrated knives also work really well for tomatoes spread some of your homemade special sauce on one side of each bun, and then if you want a little bit of mustard, why not combination of spicy and a little bit sweet really nice, i mean, obviously use whatever condiments appealed to you.
this is just this is where i 'm going, today guys slice of tomato.
these are so big.
you really only need one, do n't look like flowers are so cute?
and then a little bit of greens i 'm using baby spinach today, but obviously use whatever you have on hand or whatever appeals to you.
this is to continue your steakhouse theme of the blue cheese in the spinach and how you get creamed, spinach, steakhouse, and.
now you 're already, all you have to do.
get , your burgers off the grill.
and , i think mine already one burger, yummy cheese, stuffed burgers are good.
papa maff, that is insane crazily delicious that looks look at that those are so deluxo, fantastic and really so easy.
you should definitely make them for your next barbecue, i would.
