hi , welcome to show me the curry dot com.
andalusia , ranheim, hittle.
and today is perfect soup day, an hot and sour soup, is on the menu here?
is logical need, one tablespoon oil, one teaspoon, minced garlic one teaspoon, minced ginger half cup frozen peas and carrots?
quarter cup frozen corn quarter cup green beans, cut at an angle quarter, cup, celery thinly sliced half cup cauliflower finely chopped on large mushroom thinly sliced four cups.
vegetable broth, one cup egg noodles half cup thinly sliced cabbage soy sauce to taste one egg optional red chili sauce.
to taste salt to taste black pepper to taste one tablespoon vinegar or to taste one tablespoon cornstarch.
spring onions cut it in angle for garnishing pan over here medium size pan on medium heat, and we 're going to start by putting some oil using canola oil.
but if you prefer you can use sesame E seed oil it just gives a very good flavor.
but we just use canola with god is ready.
let 's go ahead and put in our ginger garlic.
just call it with that erotic, is both optional, but it does give a good favor.
but if you are worse to any one of those two, you can go ahead and skip it and just, and we do n't want it to burn so.
just a couple of seconds alright be ready for the vegetables.
you gotta corn, really you can text cauliflower salary, and finally cabbage.
they 're just going to saute it a little bit, so that get the raw flavor.
but it will pretty much get cooked when you create in this talk, so you do n't have to worry about it, all cooking at this point.
also , we 're making vegetarian one over here.
we are making vegetable hundreds are.
because it 's very hard to, you know, get anything for vegetarians as far as suits in our concerns.
so we 're going to use do vegetables over here.
and we 're going to use do vegetarian hardings are, but you can always switch the stock.
two chickens from make it at home or go to our website and find a recipe for chicken or vegetable stock for that matter.
and it, and you can use chicken at this point, so it will become chicken client server.
i think it 's ready.
let 's go ahead and put in stock now again.
this is vegetarian broth or stock.
but you can buy this in cans or boxes like this either way.
and this puts in seasoning that some.
so little bit of salt just a moment.
because we 're going to put soy sauce that 's good and little bit of black paper heart that 's it and i 've we 've actually kept the mushrooms for the later.
because mushrooms really do n't need to be cooked.
and we cook them in all this.
it 's going to, they 're just going to build.
and they 're going to break apart here, and after the vegetables were going to go ahead and put in or ignore rules if you do n't eat eggs in any form you can buy just the regular noodles and put them, and.
now we 're going to let it come to a boil and then simmer it for a couple of minutes and then take it from there.
so it 's been cooking for about ten minutes.
we make sure that the noodles are cooked, that 's what you really want to cook very well, the vegetables are so fine that they cook really fast.
and the noodles you do n't overcook them also because they should retain their shape and not just follow parties.
so , let 's go ahead and put in the mushrooms.
and i 'm going to put a little bit of spring onions inside now.
this is our indian chinese version.
i was and it 's very, very hardly.
i do n't know.
i do n't know if it really treated with anything else.
it 's got so much vegetable.
it 's so flavorful, snow hardy.
it 's a mere by itself, i think so, yeah, and let 's go ahead and put in the some chili sauce again.
this is to taste we 're going to put in soy sauce and vinegar again.
it matters which kind of soy sauce users, light versions, dark versions light as in less salty, so.
so definitely be careful when you put that in there.
because you 've already added salt in the beginning you do n't over do it, you can take it out vinegar.
please give it a good mix.
and i 'm going to.
i 'm going to hang up the heat a little bit.
and i 'm going to wait for to come to a good rolling.
and then we 're going to go ahead and add in a con starch.
but before i do that, let 's go ahead and taste it to make sure it 's all definitely there.
i could probably do little more, you know, hold on.
let 's go ahead and add the other one.
you have a wonderful product, says me chili oil, i know.
and it 's got a real kick.
so i 'm gonna use that second, yeah, go ahead and as is assault, you know, we, like a lot of salt, so, we 're going to go ahead and add enough cornstarch at this point.
and this is again optional.
and how much you want to put a dried up to you, you mix, it with some cold water and project basically a thickening agent.
so if you like it really thick, then you can use more corn structure, less, if you do n't.
and we 're going to wait for it to come to boil again.
and we actually broken the egg it just likely big net.
and we can do then just put it in, so that it just warms the strings over it again.
that 's an optional thing.
if you 're opposed to eggs, you know, you can just have it like this looks so good.
it 's coming to a good boil, and we 're going to put it in very slowly.
and i want to keep storing it, so looks great.
this is perfect for cold weather.
it 's coming right now, so again, and it 's ready to go.
so what we 're going to do is, we 're going to put it in a bowl and we 're going to put some spring onions on top anad around chili 's, and it 's ready to eat.
so jonas again on another episode of show me the curry dot com, adding a pinch of spice.
do you live?
