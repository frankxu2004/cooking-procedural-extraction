hi , everybody is britney welcome to my kitchen.
so today i 'm going to be making one of my favorite dishes.
it 's penne, alla vodka.
this is vodka cream tomato.
sauce is very popular in new york, and this recipe was given to me by a close friend of mine.
i changed a little bit of it today.
i 'm not going to be using for juego.
although normally i would put prosciutto or pancetta in it and normally there 's going to be sweet basil in it so it 's going to be great.
and i hope you give it a try, so, so, the ingredients were going to be meeting today.
are some freshly grated cheese?
i 'm using pecorino, romano today.
you can use loca, telly, whatever you have some vodka, some garlic, some heavy cream.
some crushed red chili flakes some tomato paste.
one of the large cans of tomatoes you can either use pureed tomatoes or whole tomatoes, i like hole, some butter, some olive oil, some salt and fresh basil.
make sure you use sweet italian basil.
i do n't have basil today.
so i 'm not putting it in.
so let 's say, you 're going to start by getting a pen.
nice and hot, and you 're going to put some olive oil in the pan after that you 're going to add about five cloves of garlic lights.
and also some crushed red chili flakes to taste.
i like it pretty spicy and at this point normally, you would add produce though you would add about five slices of prosciutto that you had chops.
i ca n't get produce, oh, in taiwan, i can get it, but it 's not great quality, and it 's really, really expensive.
so i just rather not even put it in you can also use pancetta.
although i would n't use american bacon.
because american bacon is smoked, and you do n't want that smokey flavor in your allah baskets off.
so once your garlic is nice and fragrant going to add some tomato paste.
i 'm going to add about four tablespoons.
i 'm just eyeballing it.
OK , so i just waited about two minutes for my, for my tomato paste to get nice and carmalized in the olive oil.
and now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to add my whole tomatoes.
and i 'm going to crush them with my hands because that 's what i like to do this.
what i 've always done like i said before you can use pureed tomatoes you can use diced tomatoes.
it 's really just about preference.
here goes OK, so i have my tomatoes crushed.
and the next thing i 'm going to do is i 'm going to add a little bit of sugar just.
because i tasted the sauce, and it 's a little acidic.
so i 'm just going to add like little handful sugar.
not too much.
and i 'm also going to add some salt, and.
now i 'm going to bring this to a boil and then i 'm going to reduce the heats of level, and i 'm going to let it cook for about forty five minutes.
so i 'll see you back.
so the sauce has been simmering for about forty five minutes.
my check for seasoning for salt for sugar.
and now what we 're going to do is we 're going to add the vodka.
the heavy cream, the butter and cheese.
so this is a pretty fattening dish, but it 's really good places and the busca right in, and you 're going to add three fourths.
cups of heavy cream.
OK , you 're going to add in about a half a cup of cheese, and this is freshly grated.
pecorino , romano, try to get good quality cheese, and you are going to add in about two tablespoons of butter.
so give that all mix, and you 're going to let this simmer bring it to the boil and then reduce it to low cover.
it , and simmer it for another twenty minutes.
and then it should be ready.
so it 's been about twenty five minutes in my sauce is done.
i checked too.
i gave it a taste and made sure that all the vodka was cooked out of it.
so there 's no more alcohol flavor.
you 're just left with this really nice, very rich smooth sauce and then the last thing you have to do is you just bring your penne pasta or rigatoni pasta.
whatever you prefer to a boil, an, you add it, an you top it off with some grated cheese, an you 're ready to go.
so i 'll be back for the plating.
i did n't think that i was gonna follow up mark hamill, nothing so way.
