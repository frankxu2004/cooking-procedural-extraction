you can make good burgers outside on the grill, but to make great burgers insider out.
you want to cook on a flat top or a cast iron skillet.
i 'm going to make two kinds of burgers today.
the first is the kind that you find in bars and pubs and taverns.
it 's about six to eight ounces of meat made into a patty.
you 'll see all those little bits of fat in there.
that 's the most important thing.
eighty percent made twenty percent fat.
i 'm going to take it to about medium high.
we hear the sizzle and everything is good.
the second kind of hamburger is diner style.
it 's flatter, it 's lighter, this is only three and a half or four, ounces of meat and right away.
i 'm going to take a heavy spatula and i 'm going to commit this heresy.
i 'm going to press the burger down.
it 's only going to cook for about a minute and a half on this side, and then i 'm going to turn it over.
we 're going to season with a little salt and a little pepper.
this meat that i used was cold from the fridge.
a lot of times when we talk about letting me come to room temperature before cooking it with burgers.
that 's not the case you want those little studied bits of fat.
i showed you to be nice and cold so that they do n't smear.
but they actually melt so now.
there 's a good crust there, and the darkness is kind of beginning to come up over the cliff and onto the plateau at the top of the burgers, and i just fly then.
and i turn it over very easily.
boom and you can see deep crusting.
here , all the way around the burger, there 's a fancy scientific term for that, the miard reaction.
meanwhile , our pattern burger is still cooking so i think this first guy is just about ready.
i 'm going to take a bunch.
oh , man, that looks good and put it right there.
i think we 're about ready to turn this one over so i slide under there.
and we turn it.
here , we have the blank slate of hamburgers.
this is the moment where you add cheese.
if you 're adding cheese in order to get the cheese.
nice and melted you want to add it.
this is one of the big issues with hamburger cooking is that people want to mess with it.
they want to touch, then want to prod, do n't do that?
allow the burger to sit in the pan have to do its work within do n't mess with a hamburger too much.
and it will love you back.
so , we pick it up and that is a pretty luscious looking hamburger of perfect size and comportment touch american and there you have it folks, two versions of an american classic, the diner style and the pub style.
both home cooked in a cast iron pan.
