living enter nancy hart is joining me.
now to show us how to make a delicious BLT in today 's between the bread OK nancy.
so BLT very classic sandwich staple.
what makes this one different.
this one just for a little bit of extra creaminess, uses feta cheese so other than feta cheese what else.
do we have in it?
well , we obviously have bacon lettuce tomato.
the basics, basics, a little bit of salt and pepper.
this feta and cream cheese mixture is also a little salt and pepper and two slices of multigrain bread and what 's the first step to assembling the first step would be to toast the bread just really, really lightly.
which i 've already done here, and then we 're going to take this feta cream cheese mixture and spread it liberally onto one of the slices of bread and this is just equal parts.
feta and cream cheese with a little bit of salt and pepper for seasoning mix together, yeah, just mix together with a fork very simple and very delicious and.
now would you serve it cold.
or would you heat it up.
yeah , i finally actually we 're doing this at my home kitchen.
i would just pop this slice into the oven for just a few minutes just long enough to kind of warm the cheese.
but not make it too melty and now.
what comes after that after the cheese is the beautiful tomatoes.
yes , there in season right now.
and i really just wo n't even waste my time making a BLT unless it 's because they 're just so good.
and they 're going to be the star of this sandwich, and do n't be afraid if they kind of hangover a little bit, and then after that, we 've got our bacon.
and for the bacon do you put it in a pan deep in oven, how do you prepare, well, you can cook it, however, you prefer.
i like to cook in the oven, but today, i actually cooked in a microwave because it 's so hot out.
and i did n't want to turn on the oven.
it 's about five minutes in the microwave and it turns out really crispy.
and delicious so use about three pieces of bacon is good for one sandwich, and less you really love bacon.
you can do it more totally fine.
and then we 're going to put romaine lettuce just for some extra crispy crunch.
and , you know, make you feel like you 're eating something healthy, yeah, as you said, there 's a reason.
this is a favorite yes, i mean, all these flavors together or just, incredible and then, you know, you want to just do a little bit of salt and pepper to kind of give.
the tomatoes bring out some of the flavor in tomatoes and actually like to add salt and pepper to all of my sandwiches and then we 'll put the last slice of bread here and then slice it in half.
that 's a big sandwich.
well , the lettuce makes it very voluminous.
but i think that it really helps the christmas of it.
so here i 'll let you OK sliced messy, let me know what you think.
and now what was sort of the inspiration for you to try this.
well , i feel like a lot of restaurants now are pudding avocado, zon.
so it 's got little spanish influence.
and you find that you 're seeing be able to using more menus.
or , yeah, i feel like i 'm seeing belties with lots of different variety, you know, they 've got a fried egg on them, or they 've got an avocado on them, i mean, really as long as you have these three ingredients to start you can really do.
all kinds of variations on its, well, i love the cheese.
i think it compliments everything really well.
yeah , it 's not too decadent.
actually seems like it would be based perfect to me.
thank you, thank you thanks.
so much nancy, thanks for having me.
