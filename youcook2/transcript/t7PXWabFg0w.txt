i 'll check this out in a hot pan will start out with some oil, will add are shallots, and for about five minutes, will saute until they trend a nice called a brown?
this is going to add flavor to the beans and you want to use pinto beings and this some vista makes a very nice saab tender.
flavorful pen to being for being in cheese.
burritos do n't strain it at all.
the juice, unless you want to get rid of the sodium that is.
but make sure if you strain it that you replace the same amount of water, then add some enchilada sauce monster.
you want to bring it to a boil and slowly reduce the beans we want to get rid of the liquid.
but we want to infuse the flavor until it looks like this, still plenty of liquid.
but mostly beans.
let 's talk about tortillas on the left.
we 've got your typical store bought tortilla, which is fine.
i use them all the time, but here on the right.
i bought this from the mexican market, up here and there, a thinner doughier larger.
tortilla specially made for restaurant style burritos.
now we 'll just take one of those here on the center of our plate and starting with their mexican blend of cheese will start loading are bean and cheese burrito.
it 's good to start right here in the middle.
because our hot beans will begin to melt, and we 're going to play two littles full of beans just like that rolling is easy just tuck in the sides, the back flap over the center and pull it tight as you roll forward no big deal, just make sure it 's nice and snug how long a therapy and cheese burrito.
we 're going to add some traditional spanish guys, which i have a recipe for as well, and good night.
now right over the top of the burrito we 're going to add some of that enchilada sauce and go very light with it or it 'll add too much for both flavor and then later again with more cheese.
i will take that straight to the oven under a high broil, only needs about a minute in there to melt that cheese and then when you pull it out, looks just like this and like any mexican restaurant.
