hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with whole canon that 's right.
colcannon , named of course after the famous weapon, used by the leper cons to defeat the vikings that built stonehenge and the famous second battle of blarney castle and of course.
i 'm just kidding, everybody knows it was the third battle of blarney castle, anyway.
it 's an amazingly delicious potato dish and very traditional for saint patrick 's day.
and here is how you put it together, so we 're going to put our potatoes on to boil.
i have russet potatoes.
i quartered oil, those in salted water until perfectly tender.
and , while those are simmering, i 'm going to go ahead and prep my greens somebody, use a big old handful of cal that 's about four five ounces.
my market sells it already chopped up in bags.
so all i need to do is sort of peel off those bigger stems.
i just want the leaves.
you can also use swiss chard, you can use cabins you can use a lot of things.
so my cal is prepped.
i 'm also going to chop up a leak.
now you can do this with just green onions.
but i really do enjoy leaks going to have those and slice 'em across with the white light.
green parts see those dark green parts.
those can be very, very fibrous and tough, right.
so you do n't want to use too much of that, especially since this is not going to cook very long right.
we 're just going to give these a quick blanch.
and of course, those need to be rinsed really well, leaks sometimes have a lot of sand and am going to add that to the cal and lastly i 'm going to chop up a bunch of green onions and by the way, save a little bit to garnish the top later.
so i 'm going to toss those in a blender.
i 'm going to go ahead and blanche the kaylan leaks, and boiling salted water.
so we 're going to, we 're going to bring the water to a boil vegetables, give it a good mix.
this is on high heat, of course, when that comes back to a boil going to cook that for about five to six minutes the vegetables are going to stay green.
but they 're just going to tenderize slightly and remember, we 're going to grind this down in the blender anyway.
so again, mine came back to a boil boiled for five minutes.
i fished it out with my strainer.
so we 're going to take that into a blender and puree it with some butter, and, you know, the drill just keep putting it on and off on and off.
you 're going to have to really use your spatula to scrape it down, or there 's not a lot of liquid in here, which is good, then what are equal , conson.
and yes, we 're both thinking the same thing.
he forgot to put in the butter.
i did so i put it in right here right in another tip.
besides put it in.
at the same time as the greens use room temperature butter my butter was cold in rock hard.
so it was really hard to puree in here.
so this took me like three or four minutes.
if your butterz off this is only going to take a minute anyway, regardless pureed that in a blender until fairly fine and reserve until needed are theoretically by this point.
your potatoes are cooked.
you 're going to drain them extremely well to the dry pot, match them with a little bit of butter.
but not all the way just to get it started.
because we 're going to do.
we 're going to add are green stuff.
and we 're going to match that in.
and you 're going to see as soon as you start mashing that calhan leak and onion mixture in the colour just turns into this incredibly beautiful shade of green, is it clover green?
is it emerald green is it boston, celtic green?
i do n't know it reminds me a spring.
and it makes me happy.
we 're almost done here.
i 'm going to go ahead and season this with some salt and pepper to taste adding using E to the use.
cayenne in ireland, right.
somebody report back to me on that, and then last.
but not least, if you want to put it in just a little small splash of cream or milk or you know what i wish i had homemade crim, fresh.
but a little touch a dairy here at the end lightens it up and that is done, i 'm going to spoon that into an irish style bowl.
and i think it 's actually a law you must garnish your call.
kannan with butter that 's right, more butter on top.
it 's going to melt into those steaming hot potatoes, and it 's going to make it basically irresistible with some fresh green onion.
and , that is by far my favorite traditional saint patrick 's day food alright.
let 's river dance.
this fork into that pile of buttery goodness and some recipes.
i just do n't even need to explain how good that is going to be alright those comforting buttery potatoes that beautiful, earthy green kale.
the slight pungency from the onion and a leak just a perfect, perfect springtime treat and one.
i hope you try for your saint patrick state beast, anyway.
