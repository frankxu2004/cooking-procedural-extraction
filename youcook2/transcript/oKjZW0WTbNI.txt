so start off with some olive oils and white wine vinegar.
add dijon mustard and just season it with pepper and salt and just give that a good whisk around again.
so the first dressings done now, we 're going to start on our second so now for mayonnaise dressing.
so i just want to put in some mayonnaise straight in, and the juice of one lemon and just give that a good mix through, and guys just put that aside, and we 're going to get started on the rest of our salad, i 'm going to do my apples first.
so , just using a cora disco straight through.
and i 'm going to leave the skin on with these OK.
i 'm not going to peel them, because i really like the red color in the salad, from these apples.
if you wanted to you could use green apples.
but i find red ones work the best and just cut the apples into quarters and then cut them in half again.
i got i 've got some celery, stalks here as well.
i just want to cut them up into small prices.
now guys i 've got some walnuts here as well.
now you can chop them up, if you want them smaller than that, but i actually like the size of that.
