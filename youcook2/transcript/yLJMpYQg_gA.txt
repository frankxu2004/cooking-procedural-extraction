hi , i 'm in tonight.
we 're going to make wienerschnitzel here 's everything.
we need to make wienerschnitzel.
i 'm using thin cuts of pork.
the you 'll also see traditional, veal, but i like pork.
it 's a little less expensive and it 's also very traditional.
austrian and what we 're going to do is pound the poor, very thin.
i do it in a plastic bag loosely that in a minute, and then we 're going to put it with flower eggs, bread crumbs i use.
i like to use the panko one that gives a nice crunch.
but you can use any decent bread crumbs, you know, the usual salt pepper, and we 're going to cook this in clarified butter that 's very traditional if you do n't have clarified butter, you can use regular vegetable oil.
but i make clarified butter.
we have an episode on that, so let 's get started with pounding the pork.
we want a pound or a little pork slices into very thin slick scala, penes, kinneavy butcher.
some places will do it for you.
sorry about a quarter of an inch thick.
but you want to get him as thin as you can.
so what i do is, i open up a gallon size plastic bag.
just one side with a pair of scissors.
i found him with the kitchen mallet, you can use a rubber mallet from the garage.
now and put it on a plate when they 're all done.
then we 're going to see them.
so , if salt and pepper door little pork cutlet, schnitzels, then, we just make a little assembly line go flower first.
and then just some eggs, couple exit, just whipped up with a fork, and then into our bread.
crumbs as i mentioned, i like to use the panko ones you can use regular ones if you want to get a good coding.
all this, an, you do n't want to crowd these in the frying pan so, i 'm just going to do two at a time until there.
and then cook those two and then prepare another two.
'cause we want to just brown them very, very quickly even if they 're not totally cooked.
then we put him in the oven at two hundred fifty degrees to finish cooking, but these are going to cook super fast.
this about literally like one minute on each side.
so let 's take these guys back over to the frying pan and get them going, going to heat up our clarified butter first.
so we wanted to be pretty hot, certainly, not smoking.
but we want a fair amount of this, i probably put about four tablespoons in here.
because we do n't want it to be an eighth or a quarter of an inch of oil in the bottom of this again.
you could use vegetable.
if you had to taste is incredible with clarified butter or clarified.
butter is nice and hot.
we put our little scallopini, cutlets in here when they should just sizzle nicely literally going to cook these for about a minute.
if you can adjust the heat now that their end will bring the temperature down a little bit.
so i 'm going to turn it down.
i think it 's sizzling very nicely, and wanna burn them little.
over minute has passed, so i 'm going to flip these guys over.
there should be just a light golden brown.
and i want to make some dark brown.
another minute on this side OK.
now that we 've cook.
them , on the other side.
for about a minute.
light golden brown, going to put him onto a baking sheet with some paper towel and into the oven at two fifty to finish cooking while we cook the.
next batch and then we 'll bring these out and add it to that.
start second batch of cutlets and some sniffles and take those out at this point.
i see where it we 're running, we 've used up a lot of our clarified butter.
so i 'm going to add another tablespoon or two for our last batch who is the last piece.
finished little over a minute on each side, put it on our paper.
back in the oven, at two fifty to keep warm while we cook up some eggs i love to finish venus, said.
so you could just finish it with a square to lemon.
that would be fine.
but my family likes it with a little fried egg on the top.
so i just use the same pan with the same clarified butter, and i put in the correct number of eggs is three of us, eating dinner tonight.
so three eggs.
i just over easy pizza behind it and turn it down and listen is there cooked.
we put him right on top of this missiles.
send her exit cooked on one side just going to turn him over.
so that they 're nice over, over easy, you could just put him on like that, obviously, if you like a mentally, i 'm just going to let him cook for literally maybe ten seconds on this side, and then right onto the schnitzel right.
so there we go news, are wienerschnitzel.
so here we have our wienerschnitzel either, with an egg on top or a little bit of lemon, spritz of lemon there.
you go wienerschnitzel made with pork.
