hi guys, so today i 'm gonna teach, you guys.
how to make kimchi, and i am not korean so making anything that is not, i guess culturale.
what i know how to make is a little bit out of my comfort zone.
so i hope i do n't offend any koreans out there, if i miss pronounce something or, or if i do n't make it the way you make it this is not by any means, the only way you can make it, it 's just kind of like how i make it and i 've kind of consulted korean friend of mine to figure out how to pronounce things, and you know what 's the most authentic way to do it, and kind of what in cooking kimchi instead of like what you would get in a jar at a store.
so what you need is chinese cabbage.
this is also known as napa cabbage.
but we just like chinese capital, it 's those big, you know, like overly cabbage with very, very green leaves, i think you 'll need one half cup of regular salt.
one leader water, one cup of korean chili powder.
this is not the pepper flakes that i think you 'll find an american stores.
it 's kind of like pepper.
it 's called good, good.
you , carol, could you caro?
but i 'm really sorry, but just go ask that it 's spelled G O C H U G.
A R U, you 'll need one half cup of fish sauce.
two tablespoon of just regular sugar.
you need spring onions, which is also what we call scallion.
so you 'll need a couple of pieces of that in the five cloves of garlic, and you can use ginger.
but i have a really adverse taste to ginger.
now going to use it and you 'll also um, need chinese radishes it 's what it 's not the one that 's like rounded and small and pink it 's the one that 's like white in law and that 's about it, it 's super simple.
but it does take awhile.
because you need to like soap the leaves in saltwater which takes five to six hours, and this will make enough to fit a jar which can go in the fridge.
so it 's not really like her serving size kind of thing if you guys are interested please stay tuned and i 'll show you guys how to make that OK.
so i 've done all the prep work.
so that chinese cabbages been washed and cut into roughly like i would say, just an inch tall and, like how wide the leads are, and we 're going to take these just a handful at a time and duncan, and just really salty water just to make sure every single piece is getting salted and this water is basically a leader of water plus cup of regular salt, and as the leafs go in the water they are going to shrink and become.
so much shriveled.
so that like this, seems like a lot.
but when it 's done, actually, wo n't take up this much volume in a container.
because if you can see i have my containers you 're ready.
so you 're just going to lightly toss it in this like.
so seawater to make sure every single piece is coded, and then what you 're going to do is just take some pieces like this, and you 're going to put it in, i 'm using a pot, feel free to use the container and then sprinkle very lightly salt on it just a little bit, little bit of sprinkle what that does, is that it will continue to draw out the water from the these.
so just a little bit more and can i finish this up what you want to do is keep going to the water and the PAH and then sprinkle and then, when you 're done, you want to cover this and then put it in the refrigerator for four to five hours and, i mean, time i 'll show you guys how to make the sauce.
so see you guys in a bit, basically you 're going to need a half cup of the stuff and a whole cup of gucci guru i do n't know if i 'm saying that correctly.
but you 're just going to add here we have three spring onions, and i just kind of base them and it was six cloves of garlic that i put through the food processor you 're going to add your radishes and here i have roughly a cup and a half kind of, mixed setup cases really sick it 's not watery at all, and we 're just going to take this into the refrigerator for as long as the cabbage is going to take to will, and i will see you guys in five hours by it 's about roughly five hours i just pulled it out a little bit early.
because my roommate is actually coming home and pretty late.
so i want to get this done so, when she comes back and goes to bed i 'm not disrupting her.
but as you can see that leaves are completely wilted, and you can still feel like salt on them.
so the first thing you need to do is rents it all and make sure that it 's prints off really well, 'cause you do n't want these like salt particles in it.
so i 'm going to rinse it, and when i come back i 'm just going to basically bring it out really, really, well.
so it 's really dry and then we 're going to add on the sauce we made earlier and then kind of code every week and then pack it in this airtight container and when we do that you 're going to steal it an first, put it in a dark.
but cool place for three days and let the like fermentation processing fermentation process take over and then after that, you can store it in the fridge for up to three months of course, my badge is n't going to last that long 'cause i want to eat it up like crazy, so, i 'm gonna go do that and then show you guys when i mix it i 'll see you guys soon fault has been completely washed off these leaves and what you 're going to do is you 're just going to like really, bring it out.
so you see the water is still coming out of that, and then put it into the jar and i 'm just going to cover the bottom and when i do not add a little bit of sauce and to make sure that everything is coded i 'm going to do like a layer of leaves, layer of salt sauce and layer of leaves, and then like kind of, mixing it i 'll show you guys what, i mean, once you have that much is going to scoop in some of this sauce together to make sure that all of these are getting a nice coat this is the last of the cabbage and it 's going to put the rest of us in here pretty good, then you just want to really press down on it, and you 're going to steal, it must really important to make sure it 's airtight and then this will go in a dark place for three days you guys.
so it 's been three days i made this on sunday night, it is.
now wednesday night.
so to monday tuesday wednesday, and we 're just going to try it.
so it 's pretty much ready it looks like this and can you smell that i can definitely smell it smells like him gina just.
so after three days when you can try it, and it just has to go in the refrigerator it will last in the refrigerator for roughly three months.
but i doubt mines going to stay that long yeah, taste just like the restaurant steps.
so this is going to one more time looks like this, and.
so stay tuned i have two recipes coming up one is the kimchi sandwich and the other one, is kimchi fried rice.
but stars going to go in the frigerator.
now and we 're not going to close this.
so tightly this time.
but OK, so i hope you guys enjoyed that and i will see you guys in the.
next door and get a guy to do this i think it 's a girl living.
next door, a lot of cheese clothing just open.
