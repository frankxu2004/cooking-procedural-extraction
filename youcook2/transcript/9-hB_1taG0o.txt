hi , i 'm trying to steal from epicurus dot com, and you 're watching around the world in eighty dishes.
today , we 're going to italy to tuscany italy actually to make pasta for joel with my friend chef deparrie going on.
i am very excited about this dish.
because this is kind of a classic home dish that they eat well in tuscany, particularly.
there 's nothing better than pork and beans so true.
that 's what this dish much all about good.
we ready to start here OK cool, so here we go how about this.
we 're going to start first with italian.
sausage you choose.
which one do you like hot or sweet, i 'm going to go with sweets.
so we have some sweet just like me right just like you not hot.
but sweet you 're going to cook this until it 's brown.
it 's always nice and brown, and you 're probably going to help it along with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil.
so you can see how nice and again, we do n't want it to burn.
so a moderate high heat OK.
do you cook it through so you see how very quickly?
we 've rounded off for next.
let 's throw in some onions.
so these are just diced pricing.
and so we want to cook these onions until they start to turn a little bit more on the translucent site.
OK , yeah, it does n't look nice, our.
next ingredient is going to be the beans sounds a lot of being soon, well, this is a really hard, it 's a very hearty soup now.
he would call us a fuzul now.
here is the magic fresh rosemary sprigs of rosemary, OK, and you put beef process that correct.
OK , now, some people like to put garlic in this soup, and they would put it in after the onions of fried some people do n't want to have the extra garlic in there.
but there 's a way to incorporate the garlic into the soup without actually having to eat it and that 's just appeal a couple of clothes and just set him in and then later you can get him out i see.
so the clubs are actually this boiling within.
so you bring the soup to it, which is going to bring it up to a simmer.
we may have to season it with a little salt and pepper.
smell smells great, does n't it.
now the last thing we want to do is let this thing to come to a boil.
because we do n't like the beans to break apart i think we should taste it before we played it.
what do you think because if we need a little bit more seasoning, we want to put that seasoning in before we played, oh, my god?
oh , my god, you know, it 's a sausage flavor.
is intense is delicious?
we 're going to do is we 're going to put our pasta in the bowl and then we 're going to poor little soup, right on top of that.
so that, that warms up the pasta enough, it does , well.
this , as you can see, it 's probably a good two hundred and ten degrees.
here so i 'm sure that this hot really is n't going to this is n't going to cool this down that much, oh, wow.
they 're not putting the rosemary in no, and we want to mix it up.
now is this one of those things is even better.
the next day it 's way better the next day.
look at that beautiful now we could finish this with some fresh, chopped parsley or some fresh chopped rosemary.
do you mind if i distance from the bomb?
is that OK for italian of me, right?
and that 's what they say.
right manager kids.
mangan , oh, my gosh jeff perry thank you so much for showing me how to make this pasta.
it was so delissio, so, so, thank you.
so much you 're very welcome.
