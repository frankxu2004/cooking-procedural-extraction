now i 've got a big ball of rice.
and we 're just going to flatten this onto the seaweed with your.
fingers , spread it across, OK, we 're going to flatten it down, and then spread evenly is matcha tea can across there.
we go next.
i 'm going to sprinkle some sesame E seeds.
so now what we 're going to do is we 're going to transfer the rice.
and i 'm going to flip it upside down on to the map for the rest of the ingredients.
i have some tuner which is sushi grade, and i 've just dice this into tiny little squares.
there 's almost like it 's almost like a puree.
i got some cucumber strips that have cut up.
and i 'm going to pop some avocado in as well, so i 'm going to slice the avocado, which gonna do a nice long strips down.
i 'm also got a little bit of mayonnaise, and we 're going to make some SSRI, ratchet in, OK.
so this is going to be your spicy tuna bit now, this makes a really good source.
so about friends are spicy like it just about the teeth bins worth take your tina.
i 'm going to add spoonful of the spicy mayonnaise in there.
i 'm going to start with a bit of avocado.
let 's hope jabba approves of my spicy tuna roll.
i hope he does, so we can just line it up like that at an egg.
and then we 're just going to pop tuner there.
we go give it a good amount.
get yourself, some cucumbers were going to stick those on to roll this what you going to do.
grab , you cling film.
take one end, and we 're going to fold this, so also it goes all the way over, OK.
so it 's going to be a big round sweep.
we 're just going to get every hold everything in altogether and then tuck it and give it a good card pushdown squeeze family.
like so once that 's all done you could now unroll, unwrap, your sushi roll and to slice.
you need to get yourself a very sharp knife and also a bit of water OK 'cause that 's going to help cut through the rice without your knife sticking to it and messing up all your hard work.
