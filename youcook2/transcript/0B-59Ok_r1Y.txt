when making holiday dinner there are a few essential size that you need on that table, and one of them is a bowl of creamy, mashed potatoes.
now if there 's anybody showing you how to make mashed potatoes you want it to be this irish guy now.
we do n't want any lumps in these.
so i 'm going to show you how with a couple of easy steps, we can make the perfect for data is every time first off we need to choose the right for data for the job today.
i 'm going to go with the uconn gold, because it has a buttery texture.
and it 's perfect for mashing since these are for a honda celebration.
we wanted to be so, then cream so we 're actually going to peel these first before we start.
so i want to cut these potatoes into even slices, economiste people make is that they cut the potatoes unevenly.
this is the number one reason for lumpy.
but a good indicator to know how thick to cut them use the width of your finger that do n't be afraid to compare each size to one another or.
although i 'm going to add them to the pot.
the last few here we 're going to fill up a cold water, and then we 're going to cook them off into their fork tender.
so we 're going to put these on the stove put the lid on going to bring up to a boil for about twenty to thirty minutes.
alright so looks like potatoes are done so i 'm just going to turn off the heat, or it 's going to drain them.
we want to get all of that water off looks.
so now to ensure, we got all the lines out of these bad boys.
we 're going to use a riser.
so we 're going to spoon the data was injured the riser.
three quarters full push them right through like that, or that is fantastic.
i using this right, so it will ensure that we get that nice creamy texture that we want.
that 's awesome look at that.
now i 'm just going to heat up on milk and butter.
and we 're going to add that to do potatoes.
could you really want that nice creamy texture down, was talking about earlier.
so we got mail butter good tip to remember is never add cold milk to your players 'cause they will affect the texture of?
so we 're going to add in or hot milk here with the butter.
i look at that is just coming together, so nicely it 's like a fluffy, already, so god, all right, here 's my secret ingredient.
some cram, fresh that will give it some extra richness and creaminess.
now if you do n't have any cram fresh sour cream is a great substitute, too.
season it up with some salt and pepper is combined that and now finally going to add in my child 's look.
at that texture, it 's exactly how i wanted to turn out.
OK , i gotta, taste these.
there is no holidays that these bass players wo n't go over there after iterations.
