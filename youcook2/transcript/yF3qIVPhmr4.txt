hi guys, today i 'm going to show you two ways to cook non at home without a tandoor oven.
you 'll need three forty grams of flour, a half teaspoon of salt, one ninety mils of water.
now this is luke warm water a teaspoon of sugar, a teaspoon of yeast.
two thirds of a cup of plain yogurt and two and a half tablespoons of oil.
now put all of these ingredients in the description bar.
so check that out.
now into the water at the yeast in the sugar and gently, stir until sugar is dissolved, and then set it to one side in a warm place for about a half hour and what we 're looking for here guys, is that frost on top.
now add in your oil the yogurt?
the flower and the salt.
and mix it all together.
well , now you can use the mixer or a bread maker for this, or you can just use your hands.
so once it 's mixed.
keep it a good made until that dough smooth and then place it in a lightly oiled tub and cover it and set it aside in a warm place for about two hours to rise.
so that those ready to go as you can see it 's tripled in size so, i 'm cutting it into four portions to my four non and then simply just spread it out with your fingertips into the shape that you want it 's a very soft out very easy, to work with.
now i 've got the barbeque, preheated to two hundred and fifty degrees.
celsius , nice and hot indirect cooking, of course, use your oven.
if you like and then bake it for about twelve minutes, or so is all it will take.
then simply cover with a bit of butter, and they 're done now.
the second cooking method is just as easy get a barbecue flat plate or your frying pan inside.
cover with some butter put on the non it only takes about two to three minutes per side until it 's golden brown and this is what you get as you can see it 's beautiful and soft.
