hi , welcome to the central cooking.
and i 'm gravy and today, we 're going to be showing you how to make it easy recipe for chicken.
farming lab, you will need three small chicken breasts, two to three small chicken breast for one large one spend on how much making one to two eggs.
i think this might require two.
we have about a cup and a half of flour here for judging the chick in, and then over here.
we have about one teaspoon, each of garlic powder and dried basil about a quarter cup of fresh chopped parsley and about a third cup of parmesan, grated room here.
we have about a cup of just your normal star bot bread, crumbs another cup of asian style breadcrumbs called panko, OK.
so now we 're going to cut the chick in this is just a partially defrosted chicken breasts.
i like to keep it a little bit frozen.
so that it 's not really slippery when i 'm cutting it usually recipes, will call for you, pounding out chicken breast with a melon so their flat.
but i do n't have a mellophone.
just use my knife and then just turning off the little fat.
pieces find an area where the breast is nice and flat against the cutting board and then cut it in half, kind of like butterflying the pork chop there.
you go make sure you salt, and pepper, both sides of your ticket.
i 'm going to come over here and cracker eggs and table.
and we 're also going to put our garlic butter and are dried basil in this.
it all up.
and then we 're going to go over to our.
and take a little bit of.
parsley and about two thirds to half of the parmesan, right in bird chrome call.
so this is the order.
we 're going to do this, then we 're going to take her chick in dread it in the flower, dip it in the egg and then code it with the bread crumbs and let it rest on the place.
so by now after you season, the chicken and gotten all of your ingredients together the chicken should be pretty much defrosted.
can i drink it in the flower until it 's nice and evenly coated and then into the egg mixture?
i 'm accepting that probably fall apart.
so i 'm just gonna break him up right now, and i usually like to grab a handful of my bread crumbs.
and then put the ticket in there, so the bread crumbs can just go right over it.
gotta make sure we get news license holder at first, parsley in there will crisp up and takes really good thing with the parmesan and, after you 're done, coding it nice and evenly then it, on the point we 're getting ready to start frying.
but first we 're going to turn on the oven to three hundred and seventy five to four hundred degrees and, you 're not at hand, and put the oil in this does n't look like it can be enough you want about a quarter inch duck.
all right, so we 've got all of our little tidbits out of the way.
for not time for big.
ones , you know, less i 'm getting nice and brown like these guys are and those two little ones are probably going to end up being or chester.
once you start to see it getting brown around the edges, you know, it 's almost time to put them like i said before.
you do n't really want to cook him all the way through and then go with the frying is just to get him.
nice golden brown color.
so we 're done frying, and the oven is still free.
heating so what we 're going to do is just get everything ready to go in the oven, i 'm going to baking dish.
the bigger the better that way you have the room.
how do you guys in there i do n't believe that one through?
and then you just want to boom a little bit of sauce right on top.
do n't get it all over?
because then you 're just defeat the purpose of all that crying and there wo n't be any cristela.
i put it right in the middle, and spread it around.
all right now we 're going to put our teeth on.
we 've got a mixture of shredded mozzarella, provolone, romano, aussie, ogoh and parmesan kivu will be generous with the chief google, and you can also talk this with a little bit of a more fresh chopped parsley OK.
so that you can send in the album for about seven minutes at three seventy five , OK.
then take it out.
cheese is nice and melty.
i 'm going to sprinkle on a little bit of the remaining parmesan that we put in the bread crumbs and since this is going to be right on top it 's going to get nice and crispy in the oven, and then i talked a bit more.
fresh parsley, just for some nice color on the top, OK, so looks like anything that 's done and there is your finished product.
we added a little salad to the side, you can also put chicken parmesan on top of pasta, a lot of people like to do that.
