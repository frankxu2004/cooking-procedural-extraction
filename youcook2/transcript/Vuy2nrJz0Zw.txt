welcome to amy learns to cook on the show today.
we 're going to make scrambled eggs.
now , i know what you 're saying scrambled eggs.
i 've been making scrambled eggs.
my entire life, well, i have a few tips and tricks for you that will take your scrambled eggs over the top.
now this video is dedicated to my good friend, charlie.
thanks for the suggestion charlie, and i really appreciate your support and your subscription, so let 's make scrambled eggs.
so , the first thing we 're going to do is crack six eggs into this bowl.
and we 're going to be feeding three people with this, but make some breakfast burritos out of this, so we 're going to go ahead and crack.
make sure you do n't get it.
any shells in it, and we 're just going to beat these really good.
now you want to beat up to their fully beaten 'cause sometimes i do n't beat him enough.
and then when you cook it, you have a lot of white and yolk and their separate.
so you really want to make sure that you beat him up really good.
so the white and the oak is thoroughly incorporated.
really they have they come out of the end.
so my problem in the past is, i love salsa.
so i would take my scrambled eggs and i would put salsa in it and then i would cook it and what happens is, is it 's way too watery?
it takes too long to cook, and they come out grey and muddy looking.
so , the best thing to do, is encrypt your scrambled eggs in a low temperature pan by themselves and whatever you 're going to want to put with it?
put it on top do n't put it inside.
here it 's going to end up with eggs that are n't yellow and fluffy, looking so we have the pan on probably a three and a half.
and we 're going to put a little bit of butter in.
here it is a non stick, pan.
but we want the flavor of the butter in with her eggs, right an one of the keys to really good scrambled eggs is to cook them really low.
and the way you stir am really will create fluffy eggs if you over stir it, your eggs will just look flat.
so i 'll show you what i mean.
so we 're going to take our beaten eggs.
and we 're going to put him in the pan and put him in here slowly.
now , my first instinct is to start scrambling right, but all that does is result in a bunch of curves that are all broken up.
and that 's why you get that flat look to him.
what you want to do is you want him to start cooking, and as their cooking you 're going to draw up the cook part of the eggs towards the middle, and you 're going to turn the pan and let the liquid go to the side and that cooks and watch what happens.
they come out really, really fluffy, looking.
so we 're just going to let this setup we have it on low heat, and we 're just going to let it set up really slowly OK.
if you can see this, the kurds are starting to develop so what we 're going to do is.
we 're just going to take our spatula.
and we 're going to pull them in like this, and what happens is the cooked egg is going to move in, and the liquid egg is going to move out and these are going to result in a fluffy look touaregs, and when the curve start setting up.
they start setting up pretty quickly so you just keep pulling him away as they cook and you let the liquid take the spot of the cooked egg.
so fold them over on itself.
a little bit to cook the interior of the egg, but you do n't want to stir it too much 'cause it 's just going to break him up.
and they 're going to look flat now.
what you want to do is you want to avoid cooking him too much in their browning because they 're just tough that way.
so just fold them over on yourself just like this.
and you will get nice beautiful, fluffy eggs.
you want to take him out of the pan just prior to them being totale cooked.
because they will cook a little bit on the plate to the plate just like that.
i 'm going to give it a little bit of salt and a little grind pepper.
if you do n't want black specks in it use some white pepper.
i do n't mind that.
so i 'm going to give them just a little grind, have pepper, and.
now we can take a taste OK.
so let 's take a test.
i put a little bit of salsa on the side 'cause i like the flavor of salsa.
it 's really, really good.
these are not my grandma scrambled eggs from days gone by that their flat there gray, looking their watery these are fluffy.
and there, there 's some peppers grade.
the salsa is a great addition.
they 're not overcooked there soft there fluffy.
