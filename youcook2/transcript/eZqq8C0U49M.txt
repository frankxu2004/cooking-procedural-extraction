everybody it 's rocky so last night.
i made some chicken parmesan or was it good.
i mean, seriously it was, it was delicious, i mean, this is definitely one.
i 'll be adding to kind of like a regular rotation.
it was simple super simple.
all i did was like just seizing the chick in tossed in the pan with some sauce and some cheese.
it was n't breaded and i threw it in the oven for half hour and then by being bottom.
there was my dinner.
i did n't show this.
but i actually did serve alongside of vintage in it.
was just in this.
perfection , so, if you want to see how i make my version of chicken parmesan, and just keep on watching so i have my chicken breasts out.
and i just have a combination here of salt, black pepper and garlic.
and i 'm just going to sprinkle that over my chicken breasts, and i 'm just going to rub that in.
and i want to make sure that they 're nice encoded.
i want the chicken itself to have flavor.
have you ever gone to a restaurant, and you 're eating something that, you know, some kind of like piece of chicken or whatever that has sauce on it.
but when you bite into the actual chick in it taste like nothing, and i really hate that.
so we 're going to turn over and we 're going to do this exact same thing to the other side, i have one half cups, measured out in a measuring cup of just a regular pasta sauce, and right.
now i 'm just going to pour in about a quarter cup of parmesan cheese, and i 'm just going to mix that together have a baking pan that i sprayed down with some olive oil, spray tan i 'm just going to pour some of my sauce, down right onto the pan just kind of make a little bed for my chicken breast to lay down on and get my chicken breast, and late right down on top of the sauce just like that, and.
now we 're going to pour the remaining sauce over the chicken breasts and just make sure there all covered with sauce.
but i 'm sure to pop them in two or three hundred and seventy five degree oven for about thirty minutes or until my chicken is cooked through thirty minutes later it is out of the oven, it is cooked through someone go ahead and do is put down some mozzarella cheese right over the top and this is this cheese is part skim geez, i get from trader joe 's OK i 'm going to put back in the oven for about five minutes, or until the cheese is melted, and here is our unbreaded chicken parmesan ride out of the oven, the cheese is just kind of like melting off each of the chicken breasts smells.
so good i cannot wait to dig into this.
so if anybody has, any questions, just go ahead and post them below the full recipe and pictures will be on my website, which a post a link to below and until.
next time enjoy.
