today , i 'm going to be making one of my favorite recipes and these are my potato pancakes.
i 'm using two medium size potatoes a half an onion one egg one tablespoon of all purpose flour and a half a teaspoon of salt.
so those are the ingredients.
so , let 's get started.
so for a first step, what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to chop up my onion just a little bit.
i 'm also going to peel and cube my potatoes so that 's the first thing i 'm going to do.
i 'll come back in a second when that 's done so through the magic of youtube.
a second later everything is cubed up so i have my two potatoes cubed.
and my half an onion cubed and ready for our food processor so, i 've got my food processor ready to go.
and at this point i 'm just going to get everything into here just like that, perfect.
and we get our lid on.
i do n't need this city start pulsing this together, so what i want to do here.
is i really, really want to turn this into a battery?
i do n't want any chunks left.
OK , that 's open that up and now, i 'll just zoom in a little bit, just to show you what it looks like alright have zoomed in.
and i just want to show you this.
you can see this is full of moisture, and that 's exactly what i want.
but you can see that it basically looks like baby food.
and that is perfect just like that and the.
next thing we 're going to do, we 're going to strain this right.
so let 's get all of this, right into our strainer.
hopefully , you can see that.
that , on there like that.
and what we want to do is just let this sit here for awhile until most of the moisture comes out.
well , that 's good.
and now you can already see all of the beautiful potato water that 's coming out of here.
so at this point, you can just leave it like that and head.
often do something or you can spread it around a little bit, just so that it strains a little bit faster.
i 'm just going to let that drip a little bit more and then i 'll come back.
so my potato mixture is been sitting here for about five minutes.
and i 'm just going to shake that off a little bit.
and i 'm just going to pour this water out.
there 's a little bit of starch at the bottom here, you do n't have to worry about that, just take all of your mixture now, and just pop that great in there, to this.
we 're going to add in our egg.
our flower and our little bit of salt, so get all that in there.
and i 'm going to grab a whisk, and i 'm just going to start whisking this together, and i ca n't tell you how good this recipe is you 're going to make this once, and you 're going to be amazed.
so simple, and just.
this is one of my favorite recipes.
i make this all the time you can add a little bit of pepper to this, if you wish once it 's nicely mixed, we are ready to make our pancakes.
OK , i 've set up.
i got my little hot plate going, i 'm going to get a little bit of oil down in my pan just like that.
i 've got a small ice cream scoop here.
and i 'm just going to scoop up this mixture.
and i just want to drop it down like that, that you can flatten it out.
if you wish so just take the back of a spoon and just give it a little pack will do another one here.
now , you just want to try these on the first side until they 're nice and golden brown, i 'm going to just adjust my heat a little bit.
the secret to these you do not want them browning too quickly, you know, you just want to have a nice low to medium heat on, these, these are amazing.
you 're going to take one bite, or you 're going to love them.
so i 'm just going to let these go a little bit and then will flip them, so will just flip these over now, there.
we go i wish you could smell these smell amazing, the secret to this recipe is the food processor.
if you do n't have a food processor, you 're going to want to use a greater.
and this i find is a little bit too large.
you want to go down to something a little bit smaller like this, this is quite small.
so it 's going to make a really, really nice fine, great.
but the food processor is really, really magic in this recipe.
because it turns it into this beautiful batter.
OK , that 's about done.
i 'm just going to check the bottom and that looks perfect.
so i 'll get these off, you can put these on paper towel if you wish as well just to drain off a little bit of that oil.
but they 're not bad will do another batch.
you can also just push it down like that, as well.
that 's just a little easier and we 'll just let those go as well OK.
let 's minute later or so.
just flip that one they smell so good.
so we 'll just let these just cook, you know, another maybe minute or.
so and then those will be ready and those are nice too.
let 's pop those off and, of course, you can have potato pancakes without applesauce, or my favorite, which is sour cream i 'm going to add a little bit more oil to my pan and i 'll just do this one more time and then i 'll show you all of them done, will come back for a little taste test?
if you do like potatoes, i really, really encourage you to try these because they 're really, really amazing.
you will enjoy these if you love potatoes.
so we 'll just let those go.
i 'll be back in a second.
let 's check these out, they look good, him a little flip look.
nice and golden brown, those are they smell.
OK , these ones are done and what i decided to do was just zoom.
in and just give you a little bit of a close up because i think some of you were saying.
i ca n't see anything zoom in, zoom in so will add in a little bit of oil, i 'm just using vegetable oil here.
i 'll grab some of my matter skip that right in there.
like that, you can just take your measuring scoop and just give a little push, push, push, push will just let some of the oil get around all of them.
i 'll just stay around with the camera until i flip them so that you can see the nice golden brown on the other side.
OK , it 's time to flip these there.
we go well, hopefully the camera is picking up how nice those look, look at that delicious.
i just zoomed in a little bit.
more will just let those go for about thirty seconds more.
i 'll finish off the rest.
and then i 'll come back OK.
so i 'm back.
here are all the beautiful potato pancakes that i made.
i 've got one here to test.
i 'm not sure how many i made here.
there are quite a few of them.
i did n't count them now.
traditionally , you 're going to want to eat them with sour cream or applesauce some people will actually put to maple syrup on there.
i just want to flip this over to show you how nice that one is.
i can show you another one too.
so you want to have them nice and brown on each side just like that, and then you 're just going to take a little bit of your sour cream.
get that on there.
and i 'll tell you, i 'm really finding it hard not to eat a whole pile of these 'cause they smell so good.
you just that is, really good.
if you like potato, you 're going to love this recipe.
