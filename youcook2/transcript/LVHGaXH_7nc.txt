hi , i 'm very welcome to various kitchen.
this is my first recipe of the new year, and i chose a nice salad for you.
this the classic salad and this call waldorf salad it was first served in eighteen ninety, three at the waldorf hotel, which later became the world of dorff, astoria hotel.
so you probably recognize the name of the salad, and i 'm just making it sort of in a standard way.
however it originally consisted of only salary and mannings later on english walnuts for added an from there everybody has their own variety.
so let me show you how i do it i start with apples and in this case, it just took one apple to make two cups of chopped apple and that 's what you need two cups of chopped red delicious apple, if you would rather have another apple, just make sure it has a red skin to it that would be fine and we 're putting it in our certain ball and leave the peelings on you want that color to show on your salad, then you 're going to have some celery and here i have one cup chopped celery.
but i chop it in a certain way i take a piece of clean celery that i have dried with paper towel, and i cut it lengthwise.
so that there are three strips and then to go along with a knife and cut in pieces that are three quarters of an inch to an inch, long giving all of them this it 's kind of a nice shape to heaven here use a little variety with color and shape and then i have my wellness for english wants in this package, you 'll see, they 're just called shelled walnuts.
but there not black walnuts there, the other type of walnuts and we call them english walnuts here.
so those are the main ingredients that get addressing put on them self serve them around just a little bit, before we go on, to making the dressing is n't it, pretty it 's already pretty and i 'm not have done alright we go to other mayonnaise here, is mayo free that i 'm using an you need one quarter cup.
so we 'll just put that in a small bowl that will be able to make safari dressing one quarter cup of any type of mayonnaise you want to use just trying to save a calorie here and there this is pretty healthy food if you want to start out healthily this year.
now i 'm going to put some whip cream in it and you might choose to leave that out.
because by definition model of solid just as the mayonnaise as its binder to the mayonnaise i 'm going to add one half teaspoon of lemon juice.
so it 's just this real lemon was different that it 's a reconstituted lemon juice and you need one half teaspoon i measured it here.
but i know i would.
so just put it in something larger.
but that end, and then some sugar, you need one tablespoon of just regular granulated sugar, put that in and a dash of salt, salt.
so just put a little bit of solves this to know that we had it, start that around and that does n't look like much dressing that we 're going to add something to it.
so while this, it 's a bit i 'm coming over here to a mixing bowl and i have some whipping cream sitting out and i really only need half of this.
because you need one half cup of heavy cream or whipping cream whipped.
now this is a whole cup.
because it is a half pint.
so i find it easier to go ahead and whip the whole cup and then just take half of it and i always have a use for whipped cream, i can put it on top of desserts in fact, i have actually a vegetable dish that i am playing do that has some whipped cream in it.
so may try that later today.
i do n't know.
but we just open this up and it 's not to get it straight from your freezer, having had that there for maybe half hour are solon.
are we ice crystals in it?
mine has come from the refrigerator so it 's not quite as easy to whip that way.
so let me go off and get this whipped, and i 'll come back and show you what it looks like will combine it with the beginning of our dressing, put it over the wall over salad and be finished.
i have my cream whipped, and you should whip it until i pulled his shape like this.
so if you are just getting provi whipped cream, then that 's going to make your dressing running this will be folded in and be nice and puffy.
because you have a lot of air.
beaten into it.
so when you get to this point, you may stop and remember, we did the one cups were, and we only really needed one half cups worth.
so i 'm just going to estimate this and take half of it and put it in the beginning of our dressing mix by the way, the beginning of our dressing mix is something very similar to what i use all the time in greater quantity to put on michael, saw as a call salad dressing, or i have a really nice recipe for apple salad that is, apple grape in peanuts and if you put this on it 's just really delicious.
but this particular salad the world or solid, we 're making it a little fancier pudding some an and when you put that in just put in one half cup.
that 's one half cup.
afford swift, and then you want to fold this around.
so just do n't beat it or really even stir it other than to just fold and you see it kind of, combines that you see it, is also streaky as well, at this point.
it 's fine for pudding over the waldorf salad, suggest bring that out of your bow and put it on top of your mixture of apple celery, an english walnuts and then again fold.
i probably should have done this in something other than my serving dish.
because folding gets messy, a little bit they 're just kind of spread that out to get it to more places at the beginning and then just go under and pick it up and let it get that.
nice lovely dressing, throughout and as soon as we get everything, coded.
because you do want to have the apples in particular, coded in such a way that they will not turn brown and if you are waiting for anything while you 're making this.
and you have your apples chopped, please remember to put them in lemon juice or just sprinkle a little lemon juice over them.
so they will say nice and pretty, and this is what our salad looks like this is the classic wilder south.
there you go to serve your waldorf salad.
just use a little dessert dish or a solid bone and just dip down and get some of all of that dressing and all and i just want you to see how pretty it is when it 's sitting there ready to be eaten.
it 's really a lovely salad.
have you enjoy it?
