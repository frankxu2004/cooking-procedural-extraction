today is weight loss.
wednesday , so i 'm here with another low calorie recipe for you.
i actually got my inspiration for this from our local vietnamese, which i absolutely adore that we went to a couple of days ago.
so i hope you enjoy, and here are the ingredients that you, only we have some thinly sliced cucumber , avocado.
and carrot strips some rice paper.
wraps rice vermicelli noodles some sprouts.
some lettuce leaves again choked up quite thinly, and a dipping sauce off your choice, you will also need a bowl filled with hot water that you can fit their rice paper wraps in my husband, actually made the sauce, and he used to mince garlic.
some lime juice, some soy sauce, a little bit of sugar, and some walter which turned out amazing.
first of all, we saw car rice paper wraps in the water for about twenty to thirty seconds they continue to get softer, when you take them out.
so you do n't want to soak them for too long.
otherwise , they 'll break then.
we place our ingredients on the RAP full decides and roll up slowly, if it 's your first time making these i would suggest that you do n't fill them up too much and also be patient.
you will get better at it as you practice for those of you that find the rolling bit difficult, you do n't have to fold in the sides, you can just roll it up as is and cut off the edges.
so that it looks neater.
these are incredibly delicious, but i feel that the dipping sauce is equally as important if you 've enjoyed.
this recipe, please give us video thumbs up and subscribe.
and , i will see you tomorrow with another delicious, vegan recipe.
