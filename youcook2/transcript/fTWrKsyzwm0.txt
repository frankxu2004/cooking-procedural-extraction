i remember having goulash as a child with ground, beef, and with this, i 'm adding a richness with the cube chuck roast and sticking with tradition, making it slightly sweet and serving over macaroni and turn off the heat.
and the final step is we 're going to add one cup of sour cream.
it 's really going to give it a rich creamy texture and flavor.
