now , the first thing you need is a piece of sushi grade fatty.
tuna and when you go to the meat market be sure to ask for sushi grade seafood that 's really important if you do n't get that, you can really risk making yourself or someone else sick.
so be sure to double check with the butcher behind the counter if it is sushi great.
now our lovely model here is slicing it.
nice and thin right, from the start, using our sashimi hotel and sashimi means basically raw fish.
anholt show is the japanese word for knife that really does make all the difference in the world, having their nice sharp knife to work with especially when you 're working with excellent cuts of fish like we have today.
so we slice horizontally, or i 'm sorry vertically.
and now we 're going back over and trying to get really, really small, tiny pieces were going for not quite ground hamburger consistency here.
because you know, for those of you fans out there from spicy tuna, rolls like myself.
they 're really small pieces of fish.
mix up with the spicy tuna sauce, so that 's what we 're doing right now.
is , is getting our sashimi grade or sushi grade piece of fish to those little chunks?
it , with the spicy tuna sauce now the japanese technique here is called to taki and that 's what you 're witnessing right now.
i guess chopped is a pretty close translation in english for that it certainly is a little bit different technique, but very similar nonetheless.
and for those of you really interested in japanese culture and things like that you will notice that on the hotel or knife if you will, there is some engravings on the side, and this life is from seki.
and that 's where the originally made all of the this words, and right now.
that 's where they make some very fine surgical knives as well, and actually feather brand who makes shaving things for men is based there as well.
some excellent knives, anything with a blade that comes out of that city is just ridiculously sharp.
and that 's the knife that we 're using today as well.
and i ca n't stress enough that having a nice sharp knife working with these kinds of meats all the difference in the world and pictures worth a thousand words.
so my has been demonstrating that a tacky method here certainly be careful with your fingers.
you do n't want to cut yourself and just going back and forth over the meat like.
so to get it to the almost hamburger consistency is what we 're aiming for an.
i think we 're getting pretty close just, going back and forth back and forth over the meat is really what you need to do so there.
we are really bunching it together and there we go probably one more pass possibly to, to get us there and there we go so scene, took couple minutes.
but that 's a consistent.
we want now that we.
now that we 're at that point, one mix in our spicy tuna sauce, if you do n't know how to make this sauce, please see how their video we explain exactly how to mix it together for you guys, out there.
now it gets a little trick.
it 's not exactly the easiest to mix in sauces with you just kind of rub it together, and mix it around, it does take help minutes.
but definitely you want to be gentle with your meet at this point even though we just chopped it up really, really small pieces.
but you do n't want to match it anymore than that, so just be gentle with it mixed around it might take a couple minutes.
but you can certainly get it to where you want it to be and there 's no hard and fast rules on your ratios here.
it 's whatever flavor.
you want that 's how much of the spicy tuna sauce.
she makes it whatever you think meets your spice.
miss taste now will have the avocado slices that we 're going to include a well, so here we have an avocado that we 've already sliced and have.
here , you can just see with a sharp knife going through the avocado lake butter.
it really is a pleasure to cut with those sharp knives.
so we were making consistent thin slices from the avocado.
if you want to slice horizontally instead of vertically that 's fine, two, really is just personal preference at that point and after we slicer, avocado, we want to be sure to add a little bit of lemon on top avocado, turning brown in the middle of our sushi roll, even though it tastes fine.
it really does get to be rather unappetising.
now we 're going to put it on our makizushi base, if you do n't know how to make the base here with the rice in the seaweed, please see our makizushi video.
we explain how to do that in depth and really walk you through that process.
so what we 're doing is, we 're adding the spicy tuna mixture.
it 's hard to tell from the camera angle.
but it is slightly closer to the chef or a model.
if you will, and you want to extend it all the way to the edges.
that 's really important.
you do n't want to have the orphan sushi pieces on the end that do n't have any fish in them.
so definitely extended a little bit past the nori or seaweed.
if you will.
and that 's really, really important.
so after we do that we want to get our avocado slices and they do have the habit of sticking together on the plate.
what we found after making the videos that really helps is to add some lemon juice between the slices and also on the plate below that, helps him slide right off the plate.
so you 'll see how my eyes adding the avocado.
slices are slightly did angle you do n't need to go perfectly horizontal.
and that 's where you want it.
that 's what you want to look like before.
we go ahead and roll the pieces together.
now you grab the bamboo mat lifted over enough for it to touch the other side of the sushi and with the firm gripping motion that 's how we really get the sushi come together.
now you do n't want to smash it together.
you do want to be firm.
but definitely do n't want to just mash all the gradients in the middle together.
it really is a fine line that comes over time.
a little bit of practice.
sure , you can get it down so, we flipped it over again with the firm gripping motion once again.
and the surrender at sometimes six together, but it 's not a problem at all and there we go.
the last round squeeze a little bit more.
you 'll see some the spicy tuna coming out the sides if you squeeze it.
so hard that all that pops out you definitely know you 're gripping too hard.
but if it does come out just a little bit, like so that 's perfectly normal.
and that 's what she wanted to look like right there.
so the next step is to add a little bit of the sesame E seeds on the side, roasted sesame E seeds, that is, and you 'll notice.
we put it on top enough to coat lightly and padded in just to touch, now.
next , we put on a cutting board and this is really where the sharp knife pays off incredible dividends.
will notice air it slicing right through?
and for those of you who do watch more videos i want to point out here that we use the rice cover for the rice that we used on the spicy roll.
and you 'll notice that it does n't clump up as bad when you cut through it.
you 'll notice that you get nice clean slices.
the flavor of the soul.
tiv , bryce comes out the same.
but with the rice cooker, you can see that 's where you really get these neat cuts that you can really tell when you 're cutting your sushi rolls in particular.
so here we are, you know, how thick you want your rolls and things like that is, really just up to personal preference.
it 's whatever you like i think, we 're cutting him a little bit thinner here.
so when you cut it, that 's what it will look like and the.
next step is to put it on the plate for display we use a sushi.
if you want to put on regular plate from your kitchen.
that 's perfectly fine.
usually served with some wishabi in ginger as we have as well.
but you take out the pieces for display and there you go there 's your spicy tuna roll, and we hope they turn out his wonderful in your kitchen as they did ours.
these tasted fabulous.
so thanks for watching we appreciate lice and comments and pleased.
