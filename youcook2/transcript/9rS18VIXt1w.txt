hi guys, i 'm caroline.
i 'm alejandra today we 're making peanut butter.
pad thai, pad thai is one of my favorite things to order it.
but it 's actually super simple to make, and it 's even better with a touch of the heat is on peanut butter.
so i 'm going to show you what to do we have some rice noodles beaten eggs.
some shredded cabbage for coleslaw mix.
some vegetable oil fish sauce lime juice soy sauce.
garlic brown sugar a little bit of water.
the heat is on some shredded roasted chick in and a couple of fresh herbs we have some cilantro and mint, and of course are chopped peanuts.
so how do we get started alright.
we 're going to do a couple of things if you want to store together this sauce just go ahead and add everything together.
and i 'm going to use a little bit of this vegetable oil to just see are up a little bit of egg water here tip.
and i 'm just going to gently scramble this egg so just pulling it.
besides a little bit.
i 'm just breaking it up a little bit.
but when you saute it again later, it 's gonna break up even more.
so you do n't have to worry about it too much.
so there you go i 'm just going to set this egg aside, oh, and actually we 're missing this garlic, too.
so there you go i 'm going to add the remaining oil.
so now we have some sliced cabbage.
you can actually use coleslaw mix, too.
it 's a really great cheat that makes it even faster.
so i 'm going to add this to our hot skillet.
just give it a quick little saute, so, as this is beginning to soften the zara rice noodles that actually all i 've done to them is just take a package of wide rice noodles that i 've soaked in some boiling water, an all that does, is just make them a little bit?
al dente, an ready for the skillet, and then we had this sauce.
it finishes them just right awesome here.
we going to add these and their main pad thai system learning lab here, and our sauce so that it was dark.
and you can smell it as caramelizing a little bit.
can really smell that peanut butter lover that sauce is just soaking into the noodles exactly fantastic.
so now i 'm just going to toss in this egg and the chick in?
and we 're going to be ready to play.
i love this cheat of using the chicken already.
yeah , rotisserie chicken from the grocery store so easy exactly.
or you can roast it could be leftover roasted chicken from home, either way it 's a very, very easy dinner to pull together and you can probably stop and another protein like some shrimp or even tofu right, exactly, here a nice the best part is all the toppings you can go ahead and sprinkle with our fresh mint.
cilantro and are chapped peanuts.
you can smell the heat, bring out the fresh herbs.
yeah , delicious honey.
so there you have it peanut butter pad thai.
