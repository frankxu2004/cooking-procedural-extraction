well , there will come back to the one sweet kitchen today.
i 've decided to do bangers and mash in japan.
i 've got two kilos of potatoes and a teaspoon full of salt.
i 've covered them in cold water, bringing them to the bile and then our belden for about twenty minutes until this soft, meanwhile, i 'm going to cook the bangers great sausages in the frying pan and cooking days on quite a long gas, do n't want them to brownfield quickly and national just keep turning them until there, well done all over while the potatoes are boiling for the mash.
me , while i want to make an insult to go with the bang ism right on the in source.
this is delicious.
it 's wonderful with bangers and mash basic white sauce real life with an N, said so got an ounce of butter in the fan.
we do it slightly differently with it being hung himself, so went to melt that i 've got four ounces of finely chopped onions.
plain flour chase palm fuller V half a teaspoon full each of salt and pepper and some milk.
it 'll take about maybe three quarters of a pint of milk, so with multiple trade in the pan and what we 're going to do.
we 're going to solve T the on the end gently so that this often.
but i do n't want them to brown.
so that they go sort of clear and soft.
but not, not turn brown and crispy at all.
so the books is melting in the pan now.
so i 'm going to pop in the onions.
the only in to sizzling gently now, are just wanted to sweats just to soften and very little color.
so we do this for about five minutes over a low heat until the socket union.
xosoft now so going to update so better from the plant.
flower , sir vaccine, what we wanted for the flower to cook.
but at least thirty seconds that soon as it 's all over the onions that will leave it to minutes if we do n't want the softap taste flower OK alright just sitala.
where there for minutes, it 's important to do that.
see if he do n't do it itself, will test flower want to start having the milk.
now to keep staring at that should be an elements in the source groups?
really loves the camera.
then so i 'm gonna keep, staring now until it comes to the violent, thickens the source is just committed boil now, and it 's very sick.
it 's not until you get it to the buyer that it can tell.
what consistency it is so at this stage i 'm going to add some more milk.
so i want it too far over the bangers and mash not just sit there in the great big long, they would take this to be second.
but not too thick.
you 'll get to know how you like it.
when you met some yourself, it looks lovely.
the creamer just needs to simmer for a minute and without saving cell system.
white million sources quotes now, and the barriers are doing very well.
so i 'm going to see not the potatoes for different with disabilities are not let hoped his world setting up guest down at the back to burn itself right least.
the turtles are well stocked.
so this is very not the liquid.
and then show your, i mash them, said to master very, very cela like this we do n't want him.
ash friend of mine called nichols a chef so that the best way to do this is with an electric mixer.
so there 's another option player.
but personally i can never be bothered to get the meats are out with this.
that 's all you need to wash off, so the next thing is another number bobcat, degeneres crucible classes and a little bit, tomorrow and what we do.
then is creating wait until the book them out state mounted the melt cell whipkey.
if you got a little bit of cream perfectly gorgeous, well, milk and look to reach you also recording office now, if you 're doing it a dinner.
it 's worthwhile doing a bit of pragmatist.
because once it 's called, she can freeze them in with the parts and any freezer bags and then we can use it for all kinds of things , right.
i had a mash.
now , i 'm like my sausage is very black, so, that is not a mistake that 's our life nice portion of lovely mash.
