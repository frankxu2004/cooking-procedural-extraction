hey guys and welcome back to crouton, crackerjacks today.
i 'm going to show you how to make delicious and moist turkey meatloaf.
now if you guys had turkey meatloaf before you might have found that it 's kind of dry and bland not very appetizing at all this meatloaf here is absolutely fantastic.
it does n't have the greasy in heavy dense feeling that a traditional beef meatloaf has if you 've never tried this with turkey before definitely.
give this a try and it 's super easy to make up so let 's get started.
i 'm going to start off using one pound of ground turkey here.
now , you can do this recipe with beef, as well, that 's perfectly fine.
i 'm just showing you how to do it, turkey meatloaf here.
i 'm going to add in two thirds of a cup of bread crumbs as well as two tablespoons of dried minced onion flakes, you could use chopped real lens if you want to.
i 'm just doing this quick and easy.
so i 'm using them in stuff that i 'm going to add in three quarters of a cup of whole milk, and also use two percent or one percent that 's fine.
this is what 's going to keep our meatloaf moist next.
i 'm going to take one egg and beat that up.
the reason i pre beat this is, because when we go to mix this together, you want to be careful with the mean.
meatloaf so just going to add that into my mix into my bowl.
i 'm also going to add in one teaspoon of soy sauce that 's completely optional.
it does make a difference.
however , i 'm going to use some season pepper.
he ran season.
this up maybe half a teaspoon, or so, and i 'm also going to use some fresh cracked.
black pepper, now using my hands.
i 'm just going to gently start folding these ingredients together now.
you do n't want to go crazy with a spoon or get out an electric mixer.
do n't do any of that stuff that 's going to make meatloaf dense?
and it 's going to make it kind of pasty, you want to keep your ground turkey as whole as possible and turkey as it 's naturally is really kind of isoft meet.
you do n't want to break up that grind.
so be careful and gentle with this mixture just folded over on itself and press it down more than you have to, this is also why i pre beat the egg.
so that we do n't have to mix it in there and mix this mixture of death you just want to mix this until everything is incorporated.
now i 've just got a standard cookie sheet here and i 'm going to go ahead an line it with a piece of foil, the reason i use the foil on there are any easy clean up i 'll have to do is take the meatloaf off of it for the way the cookie sheet is nice and clean does n't need to be washed.
so i 'm just going to take my meat mixture and put that out onto the foil start shaping this into a loaf if you will air quotes there i do n't use a loaf pan for my meatloaf i find it takes really long time to cook meatloaf that way and i do n't want this in the oven for a long time so, i 'm going to put this out until it is about maybe an inch and a half thick or so, and i 'm going to try and get this into a rectangular shape and then i 'm going to slightly press down a little divot in the centre do n't go overboard with this just want to make a very shallow little ditch in the center and that 's, where our sauce is going to go.
now for the sauce on top i just like a ketchup based sauce i 've got one third of a cup of ketchup in here i 'm going to add in two tablespoons of brown sugar, and i 'm going to guesstimate.
but tablespoon or.
so of prepared yellow mustard using a spoon i 'm just going to this mixture up.
now if you like a brown gravy brown sauce on yours go ahead and make your favorite sauce on top this is what my favorite is so, yeah, this is what i 'm going to use but, once i get that mixed together, i 'm going to go ahead and put that on top of my meatloaf i 'm, just gonna place that right in the ditch, be sure to get all of that sauce.
delicious , this out with the bulb and then using a spoon, i 'm just going to coat the entire top of my meatloaf here.
the other nice thing about cooking meatloaf like this as opposed to in a loaf pan is that each piece every bite that you get have meatloaf will have a little bit if your sauce on it i find when you make meatloaf in a loaf pan.
it 's just it 's short on sauce, and i like sauce on my meatloaf, so.
but once you get that on there and then you want to go ahead and put this into a preheated three hundred and fifty degree oven and you want to make this for between forty and forty five minutes or.
so it is best to use a thermometer.
you want to cook it to an internal temperature of one hundred and sixty degrees.
if you do n't have it, thermometer go ahead and cut into it and make sure that it is no longer pink inside the juices are running clear.
then you want to let your meatloaf rest for about ten minutes, before you cut into it.
that again will keep your meatloaf.
nice and juicy and then when you are ready to serve it go ahead and slice it into slices and then you can go ahead and serve this up and you can see how nice and juicy this meatloaf is it is not dry by any means that milk and never really helps to keep it moist all around basic and versatile recipe from here you can add whatever ingredients that you like if you want to add peppers to this and carrots and all that other jazz vegetables to your meatloaf.
i know some people like that do that with your own meatloaf, but this is just how i like mine so there.
you go that 's how you make turkey, meatloaf.
