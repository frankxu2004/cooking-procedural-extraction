hello , this is chef justin with howdini dot com today.
we 're going to do a very simple breakfast and everybody out there is familiar with scrambled eggs.
so , of course, we got eggs.
we got butter, but ask yourself something, do you use milk or water to mix with your eggs?
milk right wrong answer use water.
the eggs get alot, alot more fluffy.
and they do n't brown on the bottom.
so , of course, we got water, this time instead of milk.
so we 're going to start.
now by cracking two eggs into, into a mixing bowl, just like this.
there 's one here 's to.
we 're going to add in just a little bit of water here, you can just eyeball, this just, however, you like we 're going to beat these together just with a fork, really simple wrist motion here just like this flash little bit out.
it 's OK, it 's more fun that way.
OK got her eggs mixed up, so now we 're going to take the butter just like this.
we 're going to put this just in to the bottom of the pan to melt as going to meltdown really quick now.
so we 're going to give this just a quick shake just to kind of cover the bottom of the pan with butter and of course from here then and go see egg just like this.
well , you can see here since we got a really hot pan that these eggs are going to cook lightning fast.
so we 're going to get the edges moving just to, just to make sure they do n't burn which is going to make this around just a little bit, you can see the eggs are already starting to come together in a scrambled form, going to keep moving around just a little bit is the different engines are going to continue to cook themselves together.
given that really nice, you can see.
by using the water of how dense.
and how really nicely we 're coming together.
and of course again the water is going to prevent them from browning as they usually would.
when you use milk so again where it 's kind of wrestling these together just kind of keeping it moving just like this.
and once the majority of the eggs on the outside or finished and it started to become one specific piece like this, you can start folding them over just.
so then the undersides get done.
then , of course, whether or not you wanted hole you want to diced up.
you can just kind of cut them apart.
just like this, of course, she is still continuing to move these around.
just like this making sure the inside always have these covered up eggs here, are always done.
because you never want to find yourself eating a raw egg very bad for you and just does n't taste good either , now.
these are looking just about done.
so right now we 're going to pull these off the heat just like this.
and we 're going to throw these onto a plate right over here just like that.
now you got the eggs.
on the plane you can do just simply like your favorite kind of cheese.
like right now, i have romano cheese.
so we 're going to kind of sprinkled this right over the top here just like this, and also even if you want to garnish with a little bit of parsley on top salt and pepper of course, and for whatever reason some people like maple syrup on top i have no idea why.
but just like this, you have a very simple classic american scrambled eggs for breakfast.
