hey everyone shift jason hill, he ran my wife finally perfected her hummus recipe, and i 've been wanting to make a video on it for awhile now.
so we 're going to do it.
this goes really good on sandwich spread, you can put in your raps or just set it out as a dip with your favorite chips.
so let 's get started.
first , we 're going to start with two fifteen ounce cans of garbanzo beans, also known as chickpeas that we drained.
and if you want to real creamy texture to your hummus, you can take the time and remove the paper thin outer layer of the beam that, that 's a lot of work.
i 've got a pretty powerful blender.
so i 'm just going to let, let it chop that.
OK , well, are beans are draining going to get together the rest of our ingredients?
we need four lemons.
we need the juice from them, catch the seeds, you do n't want the seeds in there now.
we 're going to take two large jalapenos, cut off the top, cutting lengthwise down the middle.
and i just use a little melon baller to scrape out the seeds.
you can leave the seeds in if you like.
but scrape the mountain goats quite a spicy that way alright, i put together the last few ingredients and now, it 's time to blend and check this out i 'm coming out of nineteen ninety two and retiring this osterizer blender that we 've had forever, and getting with the modern blending times i.
now have a blendtec designer, seven twenty, five this thing there is no comparison to a regular blender.
so if you do a lot of blending smoothies, whatever it 's worth the investment in this thing since i 'm making a larger batch of the hotness i 'm going to use my wild side jar.
but i also have the twister jar if you want to have this recipe and you have that jar with a blend teck i recommend that one and from some of the research i 've done when you 're blending you want to start with your liquid ingredients first.
so there 's our juice of ford lemons followed by four tablespoons of extroversion olive oil.
next two tablespoons of tahini, which is a paste of sesame E seeds next, to add a teaspoon of my garlic shallot, puree or if you do n't have that just use two clothes of garlic.
next we 're going to throw in a healthy tablespoon of ground khuman, followed by a teaspoon of kosher or sea salt and then our chickpeas or garbanzo beans or weird name like chickpeas has a word chick in it OK, if you want you can stop right here.
blame this up for a traditional hummus.
but since my wife likes her spicy versions of things were going to take it to the.
next level and put in our jalapenos.
but and, then last is a cup of rinsed, cilantro leaves to thin out the hummus and make it a little more creamy.
you may need to add a little water during the blending process.
so i 'm going to put in about a half a cup.
put our lid on tight, let 's let the blendtec who it 's magic OK, we 're going to turn the power on.
check out this cool digital display feature, you have a few choices there.
i 'm going to go with the dip, which is this one right here.
OK , let 's get ready to rock and roll.
but it smells wonderful.
well , there you have it homemade hummus one little tip.
if you 're going to serve this, make it that day had a time, but it 's refrigerated overnight all the flavors will blend together better.
let 's try it man that 's good, good job camera lady, give it a try guys.
