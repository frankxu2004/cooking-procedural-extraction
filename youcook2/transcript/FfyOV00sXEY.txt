hydrants are mrs russia, today.
i want to share a soup recipe with all of you.
this is very, very simple soup which i make it regularly and anybody can make in a very simple wave like homestyle.
i 'm going to show you this simple soup that is tomato soup.
maybe you all know how to make this tomato soup.
but still, i want to share my recipe, which i make it regularly at my house, so.
let 's start this simple tomato soup.
i 'm not using too much of ingredients today, china making.
so i 'm using little bit of garlic and one onion and just three four tomatoes.
so here in a pan first, we 're going to add some, either you can use olive oil or butter or oil anything if you home style, you know, you can just use either oil also just add some butter and we 're going to add some garlic in it let this little bit sorted and then we 're going to add some bailey and some peppercorns and some one onion, you know, you need not chop it you can just add it directly and just three tomatoes this also, you need, not remove the skin you need not finally, chop, just cut into little bit big cubes and this we 're going to just sort it for two to three minutes, and then we 're going to add good amount of water and we 're going to boil.
it once this is nicely boil, then we 're going to grind it into a nice smooth paste in this, you can just add some salt also very little later on.
we will check the seasoning and then again, we can add the salt.
so just mix it.
i will cook for two minutes.
then we 're going to add water sodium dress here after two minutes of nightly sorting we 're going to add water, you know, you can just add some two to three cups of water and we 're going to simmer this for at least five minutes, then we 're going to switch off the flame and grind it.
so we 're going to wait for five minutes.
so dear friends, after five minutes of nicely, it has been similar and nicely boil.
so now i 'm going to switch off the flame.
an , you know, just let it slightly cool down real nicely make it into a fine paste, but before making into a paste just remove this bay leaf.
and we 're going to grind this now.
so difference, once you know, this is slightly cold, and i made it into a nice find paste, you know, you can just remove a little bit of water only first you grind the ingredients.
then if you need water, you can just add some water and you can make it into a nice fine paste and this.
we 're going to now again.
we 're going to simmer it for another three to five minutes.
then some soup tomato soup will be ready so in the same pants just add very little of butter again.
or usually what i do is when i sorted this onion garlic and tomato at that time, little bit for thickening what i do is, i add little bit of all purpose flour.
so you can just add one teaspoon of all purpose flour in the starting itself.
so that you know, this process, you can just keep it just add teaspoon of all purpose flour and we 're going to make this nicely just for little bit of thickening we have just going to add them and this all purpose flour that 's it just for a minute we 're going to cook it, then we 're going to add little bit of water not milk or anything.
just little bit of water.
so that you know, it wo n't for many lumps very slowly, see that this one for many lumps, or you can just directly strain this into, you know, this mixture, but, you know, if you do it directly, it may form lumps.
so to avoid lumps first i 'm adding a little bit of water see, this is nice and this mixture is ready.
now for little bit tickling see and.
now we 're going to strain this tomato make sure just take his trainer and strain it 's like this for tomato color, you know, you can just add a little bit of red color if you want.
but we 're making a homestyle tomato soup.
so i do n't want to add any colors into this.
so just strain it out and let it boil for three minutes then we can have this hot, hot soup before this gets simmered.
so we 're going to just check the taste first.
so just take little wow i think i can add a little bit of, you know, salt always for soups, you know, you reduce the salt, you know, we 're going to have only the soup.
so if it is more salt we cannot have it.
so always reduce the salt and in this in the last, we 're going to add little bit of herbs mixed herbs if you want you can add it or if you do n't want you can just keep it.
so just add very little to give little bit of that herbs flavor that 's it you can see, this is little bit think once this will simmer for another two minutes then, this will become little more thick.
so we 're going to wait for another two minutes, then our soup will be ready.
so here my soup is ready after two to three minutes nice simmering, and, i can feel nice aroma over here and in the last, you know, just very little just, you know, if you want you can add a little bit extra.
but very little off sugar to give little bit of that sweetness and that 's it this is all done and just switch off the flame, you know, you can just list and see if you want a little bit thick then you can add a little bit extra of all purpose flour, or you can reduce little bit of water quantity, and you can make it a little bit thick.
so whichever way you want difference, you can just make your own version in the last we 're going to add the cream when we serve also what you can do is just you can just drop little bit on top of it that 's it this is all ready to serve.
so here are soup is already just serve it onto it.
so bold, my cream was little bit thick so, what you can do is you can just dial you little bit, and then you can add.
so that you know, you do n't have any cream to be seen on top of it.
so you could just mix it nicely, and this is done and.
now when you go to a restaurant when they serve this nice hot tomato soup they 're going to give you, either a nice noodles fried noodles or even other bread, which are nicely toasted.
so these are little bit, you know, this is i have just toasted it in the last you can just put your little bit cream and then you can put this mint leaf on top of it this is all ready to serve your family members, or your guest or whomever you want to serve it just boil the ingredients a make a nice simple tomato soup homestyle.
so let me enjoy this nice.
so and you also, wow, this is perfect and this is super, please try this and you 're going to enjoy it.
