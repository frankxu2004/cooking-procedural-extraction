whatever dot, com today we 're going to make a dish from the european side from the polish side, and they called perogies.
i 'm going to simplify this, this, look like sour momos.
but these have its own taste.
so far this just takes some all purpose flour.
and in this add salt and add some sour cream.
you can sprinkle middle water.
you 're nice solved or you want to need this dog.
so if it is sticking your hand, just applied little bit flat and just need it for like around three four minutes till this door becomes slightly elastic.
the more you need the more better.
this is see now.
this is good, well needed and then just cover it and let it rest for around twenty minutes after which we 're going to make our european style.
momos called perogies now, we will make the stuffing for these perogies.
i 'm going to make easy method.
what i usually make take some grated potato.
this is boiled potato, which has been created women you can use mashed potatoes in this.
add salt and some grated cheese.
whatever your favorite cheese add in this, this goes in the stuffing.
i want it to be nice and juicy.
so i 'm going to add some butter and add some pepper little more rock paper.
and in this, add some chopped parsley.
now makes all of this, and this is what we 're going to use other stuffing, you know, after twenty minutes of resting the door just sprinkle some flour.
so this does n't stick to the rolling pin and.
now you will be able to roll this door ten.
but if you try to do this immediately after it off it will start stretch easily this is fantastic have managed to roll it.
nice and even and then take a cutter cut them into this small disk for perogies.
laugh now, after cutting, remove this extra door.
and then just you can reuse the door by just mixing the door.
and you may have to rest it for another five minutes after mixing this and then again, you will be able to roll it this potato and cheese stuffing.
they put look at this is very easy.
this is a mechanized factory style of doing it, you know, put one, one on each one of these, and then this easy, they usually put some sore crap and.
because i do n't have it.
what i did , is.
i took some cabbage finely shredded eight.
add some salt and slightly steamed it.
and this becomes slightly softap.
