welcome to have our meals dot com.
i 'm here with jerrod, would of sushi by jerrod, and he 's going to show us how to make a california roll.
what we 're going to do is put on our gloves sesaminol on our fingers again.
the reason why we 're using sesame oil on gloves infuses really, really well into the rice going to grab.
are nori sheets were going to grab bar place just a nice little palm, full, replace it right in the middle of the nori, and we 're just going to work?
cover this nori sheet and get all those edges covered, sent it in a little bit.
we just want to make sure that you 're not.
you 're not changing the consistency of the rice that you work so hard to create next step is always sesame E seeds sesame seeds toasted sesame E seeds.
so now we 're going to grab our maps or maps to take our mats here.
time , we 're going to put the rice sing down.
the race is facing down that correct always.
tape down we 're going to grab some crab, crab me this crab.
meat is sushi grade crab meat.
it 's called the C.
stick this one is used with real king crab juice, is.
so now we got our pieces of crab, we 're just going to put those on to the rule what i tend, to do is i visually look at a wall.
i tend to try and keep my product closer to me.
it just allows better when you 're pulling it together to get that seal that you need.
so we 're just going to add some, so we cut before and we 're going to add some avocado.
so we grab this avocado going to go a little bit thicker and just when you 're cutting the avocado.
you do n't need to use a lot of pressure and let your blade just slowly go through the avocado to get the cuts that you want.
but we 're going to do is you 're going to take your fingers and use our thumbs in behind.
now this is where it gets a little bit tricky.
this is we 're going to have to make sure they were forcing that in not using a lot of pressure that is squeezing out the ends and give it a fold over just to get that scene feels alright not bad, not, bad, not, bad, not bad at all.
right now we 're just going to one two.
so fingers up in the corner again, just lifted up grab with your right hand or fingers in front, and behind one two , wow.
OK , ready walla, look at that 's amusing.
so put arm at.
flip it back over right put it to the end, and just kind of work that down there again, you do n't have to use a lot of pressure just feeling how the product inside your hand condenses everything together that in the middle class, sometimes if you get a bad cut you can just remove that, that 's for yourself.
it 's true, do n't have to push, let the blade to the work and check this out little problem there we go cheers, i formulas dot com.
