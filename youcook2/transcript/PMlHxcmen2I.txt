well , perhaps one of the favorite ways of i like to entertain is at breakfast or brunch and eggs benedict, always seem like this special tree when you order it in a restaurant why not make it at home.
well , today i 'll show you how easy it is to make an for mother 's day, well, it is probably the nicest thing you can make for eggs.
benedict one, oh, one consists of english muffin, halves canadian bacon, and poached eggs smothered in a big dollop of hollandaise sauce.
so i 'm going to get the hollandaise sauce.
i did hear you need three egg yolks and use grade a fresh eggs for your hollandaise.
it goes a little bit of water, one and a half tablespoons of water go into the egg yolks, and i have it pre measured right here.
now will just let that sit aside while we start the canadian bacon.
you can use canadian bacon if your mom eats bacon if your mom prefers not to have bacon then, you could substitute wonderful scottish smoked salmon would be very nice.
you could even use i 've done evil witch is delicious.
and i 'm going to just cook the bacon.
this is lena 's.
you can get there 's very, very little fat if any fat on the canadian bacon and it is to be heated very slowly, do n't cook this too fast?
this canadian bacon is from nodin smokehouse in torrington connecticut, the english muffins, well, i prefer to break the english muffins with my fingers, you can also use a fork.
but i like the roughness on it, be placed in the toaster and just get them ready.
never cut an english muffin with a knife.
not even a serrated knife that does not give you that rough texture that toasts really beautifully the recipe for this by the way for eggs.
benedict is in the martha stewart, living cookbook this is a great present for mom , too.
if you 're so inclined so now we have our bacon heating.
we have our water simmering for the poached eggs.
you could put your eggs put the fully cooked poached in a bowl of ice water and then you just warm them up again i 'll make.
one like that, and then i 'll show you now.
this is just do n't let it cook too fast the water.
you do n't want your egg to break up.
an if these are really, really fresh eggs, that 's the best you drop the egg into the water and immediately with a slotted spoon.
pull the white up over the yolk.
you want an ice, roundy overly plump poached egg.
you can move it around a little bit you do n't want it sticking to the bottom of your pan.
bring in quite a bit of water.
this works very nicely.
the bacon mean turned if you cook the bacon too much, it gets hard to make sure you cook it slowly now to poach day.
if you 're going to reheat it, do it on the softside?
handy tip is when you take out the poach day you can drain it on a slice of right now.
this is release off, but i 'm going to just roll that off into the ice water, and i 'll use that one later now.
the hollandaise, the three egg yolks and one and a half tablespoons of water this mix over simmering water bath.
we have created our own double boiler here or little band.
marie continue to cook this stirring constantly about four minutes until the egg yolks are nice and thick.
benedict , some say that it was named for harry benedict, a prominent banker who regularly ordered eggs at the waldorf, astoria.
because he was convinced that they hear his frequent hangovers.
well , eggs benedict is generally agreed to have originate it in new york city in the nineteen twenties.
others believe that the same new york restaurant delmonico 's may have also been the birth place of eggs.
benedict having been created for mrs lagrande, benedict, a regular luncheon guests when she complained that there was nothing new on the menu.
i have also.
one are unsalted butter that 's already been melted.
and i think.
that , that is, pretty nice.
so we 'll take this off right away.
add your lemon juice.
one and a half tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice.
this gives you that really nice flavor, and then you slowly whisk in your melted cooled butter.
now this will have to be used quickly.
so we 're going to have to put that toaster on now.
there 's a lot of milk solids in the bottom of the pan.
here , i 'm going to just pour off the melted butter, leaving the milk solids and i do n't want that, and season.
with coarse salt and i 'm going to put this right here on the warm stove now we 're going to approach the rest of the eggs so raise the heat a little bit if you 're going to do a lot of eggs at one.
time , and make sure that after the addition of each egg, you turn it over.
just pull up the egg white over the egg.
put your toast down skim the water frequently to get rid of all of this excess egg, white.
and they are looking very, very nice, except for that one.
you see how the yolk has separated from the white.
just put that in a.
dog , food dog will be very, very happy with that coach to egg and now just take that.
other poached egg out of the ice water.
see how pretty it is nice and firm just add that back.
and we have one two three four five six perfect six eggs.
and you can just slide your eggs on to a warm plate so that they do n't get overcooked here.
i think that 's a perfect poached egg.
another perfect one so nice and oval that is, now toast has to be done.
there 's one and always make sure that you have a top and bottom on the plate.
there 's always one.
that 's a little flatter and one that 's a little rounder and i always put tiny little dab of butter do n't tell anybody.
i do n't think this is in the recipe.
and we put our canadian bacon now.
if you do n't want to put the butter on you could put two slices of canadian bacon for each half.
i think that 's what the recipe calls for but one is plenty and the eggs.
themselves are very nice.
they are and now for the final touch, you 're wonderful, wonderful hollandaise.
now this is what brightens up the entire plate look at the colour that 's because of those eggs.
of course look for fresh eggs, and this is light hollandaise.
do you see how it 's going on?
it 's not thick and gloppy like you get sometimes sprinkle with a little bit of freshly ground pepper, and if you like some finely chopped chives.
benedict one, oh one perfect for an elegant brunch celebration and happy mother 's day for more entertaining decorating.
