in my cooking channel, check cookbook and today, we will be making potato glash.
growing up my mom is to make this pretty often because you do n't use regular beef as you would, for beef collage.
but it just use a kabasa which is less expensive, and that 's what we enjoyed.
so before i go into the recipe i want to tell you another funny thing.
usually when i say, something to steve, he will misunderstand me, but this time it was the other way around, he said something, and i completely misunderstanding misunderstood him.
so he said at least, i remembered couple of things and what i heard, i heard at least, i remembered to cut my fingers.
so i was really confused.
and in my head, i was just thinking does n't mean cut my nails, did he just went upstairs to cut his nails, but it 's a cut.
my fingers, it was really funny because that 's he says.
this is over the what he always experience.
when i say something, he hears something else and then in his head is trying to figure it out what i just said.
and it does n't make sense so that 's, that 's our home, and we have lots of fun in our, so this is the recipe as you see.
it 's a lot of ingredients, and i know that you wo n't be able to remember it.
so under the description in the video, i put the link where if you click on it, click on it, at least to my website and there you have all the list of ingredients.
what we need is one medium onion and here, we have potatoes because it 's potato blush.
we have for medium potatoes.
this is amazing these are from my own garden.
i group of heroes for the first time, and look at them amazing.
these are golden potatoes.
but you can use any potatoes you have.
and if you do n't have median once just get three big ones.
you will see then when it one tablespoon of olive oil now we need this kobasa.
you can get either polish kabasa or here, i have turkey.
kabasa does n't really matter.
and this is twelve ounces.
and then we have two tablespoons of paprika.
i like to use hungarian, but breaker.
it 's really good, then we have five cups of water and you can use either be stock.
if you have or if you do n't have just use water and then use this be phase.
then we have lower bit of black pepper.
the one tablespoon of sorrow and when i was growing up my mom did n't make it spicy.
but i just like a little bit of spicy.
so , i add a tiny bit of cayenne pepper.
but you have to be careful and if you do n't like spices, just forget about it, and just use, use, use it without it.
and then for our flower base, we will need another water, so this time is one cup water.
half cup of flour an to spice it up.
it 's one tablespoon of margarine, margarine is not really spicy.
but it brings the nice flavor, so, let 's start first thing, we will do we will slice our onion.
already bill with.
do you wanna, make it on small pieces?
so i do n't think i ever showed you guys.
how i slice my onion to make it kind of small chunks.
so correct like this, do n't go all the way to the end, so it does n't fall, fall apart on you make a thin lines.
and now this horse, together.
because you did n't go all the way to the end and.
now you have a control over it, how thick or thin slices you want.
so let 's do really thin ones say it goes really, really, well menu.
end up with so personal slices.
i put the onion in the part and now i like to prepare all the ingredients ahead of time.
so what we will do next.
we will peel our potatoes and cut them on small pieces.
potatoes are peeled and washed.
now we can cut it on small PCS about this big this way.
it will cook faster and be like smaller potato chunks next thing.
i like to prepare ahead of time is cut this list club awesome.
so what i do.
i like to cut it like this language.
lengthwise , ropes thousand over the best and now you just got it like this on for my mouth.
good ingredients are cut and ready and now we can start cooking this is pretty fast meal.
you just pretty much wait till the potatoes are soft and then it 's done.
let 's add one tablespoon of oil and turn on the flame and.
let 's fry this onions, and you will have to steer it pretty often.
but keep it on high.
because if you do it on low, then onions get cooked.
but does n't really get fried and crispy the onions have a nice color.
so the pot whoopsies, but this is stainless steel part and that 's what happens.
but it 's much healthier than teflon, so.
let 's turn up the flame and will be adding two tablespoons of africa, and you do n't want to add it while it 's on the flame.
because public are going to burn becomes better.
they are adding two tablespoons, this is hard to measure.
because it 's hard to come off sometimes.
you make a big mess, but it 's OK, so this is one two tablespoons of africa.
that 's the red little bit and turn on the flame, but put it on lower and what number six does.
we want a little bit to fry it, but do n't burn it to give a better flavor just for little bit that 's good.
now , let 's add five cups of water.
but the flame on high let 's add more ingredients.
we have one tablespoon of salt little bit of pepper and love a bit of can pepper.
i , wanna put the really little.
no , i have the potatoes carefully, so does n't splash.
i 'm doing it from aside flash, and you can add also the kobasa.
so it 's already the flavor gets into old into the clash, and i want then comments tear it and wait till it starts to boil.
it starts to boil.
so , let 's add one tablespoon of these beef base.
it 's a organic beef base without MSG.
so it 's not bad for you, and if you wanna know, which kind of using you can go under the video click on the link, and i have products that i 'm using, and you can purchase, it put it on lower about number six.
but have it still boiling little bit, i will wait till the potatoes are almost done.
and in a min mean time will prepare our flour mixture for our flour mixture.
this will help to thicken up the source because it 's not a soup so it has to be a look later so.
we have one cup of water and half cup of flower 's put it all together and with the whisk, just mix it together, i do n't have a big clumps it does n't take long and the potatoes are almost done.
so now they will be adding a flower mixture.
i recommend using, using this strainer because you do n't want to have a big chunks, so this is the water and flour.
it 's not like this, but also, have i would n't spawn already and then steer it right away?
say this is all that would end up in the garage and would n't be too pretty.
let 's put this on higher a little bit and this will thicken it up, but keep steering last thing.
we will be adding an is one tablespoon of margarine, which is a great herb and in check.
the love the flavor keep steering, and cook it for a little bit.
so we have a time to have this sauce, take a nap, are potato goulash is done?
and does n't look amazing.
it 's so good and ever super fest two and super easy.
it 's time to serve it up.
so my husband is a taste tester again, and he enjoys doing it, oh, this what 's it called again, but damn potato goulash not to be confused with.
it 's also good not to be confused with big goulash.
this is actually a very memorable dish to me because this is the very first dish christina ever made for me and it completely blew me away.
so i 'm really excited to have this again.
it goes really, well with the brat, an this is a bread that steve mate, and it 's really good.
keep an eye out for a new video, coming soon where i will show you how to make this bread.
this is delicious way, this guy incredible.
these potatoes, they got golden potatoes and salami, kobasa.
