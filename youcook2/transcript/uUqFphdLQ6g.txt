cooking with kyler weekend clamp shattered so today.
i 'm really excited to get my culinary mentor.
let 's wormhole gail arnold ready.
so good to see you again this, i got manila clams OK in new england, we would use something called a CO hog right and then we would chop it up.
but these are sweet.
they 're pretty were on the west coast.
i 'd rather put those plans on the hot nicely done remember our plans are already washed, right.
we always wash prewashed clam.
how about a couple cloves of garlic.
no for in a little bit of water, so they see nicely, and that will make some good clam juice right now.
we 're just going to pop cheese on the stove covered for about five minutes.
we 're going to drop some potatoes.
eat the skin on.
because this is what we call a rustic clam chowder for group sales, cut them in half cup, someone after that.
let 's see, you 're very persistent , now.
let me see, how would you cut that, that 's perfect.
that 's exactly what you 're supposed to be doing.
it is true that tyler.
well , i 'm going to do now.
but we 're going to take these plans out, put them in a bowl and then we have a job to do in a minute.
is to take all the little plans out of a cell look at all the juice that the classmate and.
now this is going to be the juice that we cook our potatoes in clam juice is going in?
we got eight ounces here.
you want to go sixteen hours.
very cool alright will you were an onion duty.
so that either and i are going to be crying over here with your dad, die before you can find software, you can use bacon.
but in new england, we would traditionally use salt.
do you have to get up and converse?
no , no, no, we 're just going to render it.
we do n't want to put it over to high heat.
'cause if it could.
slowly , all the fat comes out if you cook it too fast it browns, too.
i 've been doing this all wrong, and this is way too much just going to take the clam with your fingers, just grab the clam itself in case like the ocean, monte of shinnecock ocean gum.
it is like ocean of, you know, that 's a mermaid, you do know that right could be a problem making shatter with you too.
because all your doing is eating the clowns.
i 'm not going to have any plans in our child.
are you eating a chip body rendered and find the smells in?
at the same time that is.
so delicious service that was good alright.
