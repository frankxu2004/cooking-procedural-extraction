how is none other than food network chef jet tila from battling chef morimoto on iron chef america to guiding anthony bordain through la 's thai town on no reservations chef jet?
tila is not only celebrated for his expertise on modern asian cuisine.
but also recognized as the first ever chef to represent his country 's culture and cuisine in the united states, bangkok market was the first time market.
nineteen seventy, two was forty years ago believe or not born.
yet i got to see the tech community growth around me and i got to be integral part of it and thanks to my parents, you know, i 'm just kind of caring the torch that they say, well, this is why we had to have you today to learn how to make pad thai.
and i 'll talk about thai food in general.
what makes up thai food, so there 's a three letter word that sums it all up.
and that 's why U M that 's young, young, and all that means is a multi ingredients will fall into four flavors.
hot sour salty.
and when you balance all those flavors perfectly, that 's the.
so i 'm going to teach you how to make the pad thai sauce, which is the perfect example of young alright.
let 's start with a familiar flavor, which is sweet.
now , you 've got sugar.
there so to that base, you have three acids, lime.
juice tamarin or rice vinegar.
what is hamlets your little taste here will do this, so it would be food safe today?
and it 's a clean sourness, right or lime juice might be slightly sour and bitter terrans of very straight clean, sour.
so go for throat.
am right in there just hammering would be fine?
if you had just lime juice every had just vinegar, but i like what the little flavor variances each ones bring.
ryan , we have three left in the three left so we have to go salty fish sauce.
entire we call an umbrella fill in tagalog.
but these two etc all it is guys is thailand 's version of soy sauce and if you ca n't get fish sauce, soda sources that.
now we have a fork in the road we eat it spicy in thailand.
if you do n't like space, do a little pep rica?
and if you like spicy, spicy or not spicy alright girl, throw that in there.
stir that around, and you just made pad thai sauce now.
is this something that you can do ahead of time you can do this way ahead of time, and i 'll tell you what you can be very sheffey?
multiply that by two three five or ten.
and they just put in a squirt bottle.
and you 've just made your own pad tests refrigerator alright so it 's cooking time it 's cooking time.
so i got my walk hot always preheat your walks a little bit.
now , someone does n't have a walk.
this is great.
because the heat is centered at the bottom, and whenever you start things around the fall back to the middle, so, if you do n't have a walk, you do n't need one everyone.
is a dutch oven nowadays you have those really fancy in analyzed cast iron that super sexy or just a pan with high sides with oil and i.
promise , i promise never to use olive oil in asian countries.
never to use olive oil mix with huge tip.
i like olive oil.
but the flavor clashes with kind of the asian flavors in my opinion garlic, so, throw that right in there, right tried shrimp pretty intense at its own big delicious in food.
delicious , so little directory, have been there and then here i do want you to taste this, this is pickled radish pickle relish that 's really nice, oh, yeah, good is n't it.
so alright so proteins.
now we 're in protein ville and again i have four proteins.
you do n't need for proteins you could pick one two whatever you got, on hand, but tofu is easy.
you can probably much find tofu everywhere.
right little chicken breast is going in.
and you like shrimp.
right , yeah, alright, and you 're going to do the eggs now, should have you seen ingredients in a pad thai that you think are absolutely absurd that some people do?
and you kind of want to set the record straight kills.
when i see catch up.
it 's kind of red.
the ketchup no stop, using ketchup here will use the other way.
so check this out.
here 's a cool technique, now i do n't want like super scrambled eggs will watch i just kind of break the yolks.
and i push things against like the side, and i let the eggs kind of dominate and.
so as it starts to kwag, ulate, i just have to bring it up together.
you see how that works, so we need to talk about noodles.
OK , so what kind of noodles are we using, so you want to use rice stick noodles.
OK , that 's the best kind of noodle.
if you 've ever had vietnamese food.
there 's a dish called FA same noodle bar, noodles pad thai.
noodles are the same.
they either come dry or they come semi like semi fresh like fresh pasta by the dry stuff.
soak it in warm water until feel that and you can help me describe with it through so not al dente.
i like that very al dente right perfect, so you can fold all those together.
so and then tongs are really nice to have this woman if you.
so what we 're looking for in the pan is the protein to be done about half way too little alright.
so , so the shrimp should be a little pink.
the chicken should be almost done, absolutely and the noodles are going to go from al dente to almost like cooked.
now , it 's time to go to sauce.
oh , it is, oh, this smells fantastic sauce with the pam.
it 's starting to caramelizes, sugars or actually reacting there getting nice and sweet.
they 're making things stick together and now, we 're going to do some veggies.
so i 'm going to show you a really cool trick.
bean sprouts tend to scorch right with direct heat, so we 're going to steam them slightly.
wanted to leave a little bit for the plate and then scallion same thing.
and i want you to just kind of folder make a little bit.
OK , all put in there.
i put them to bed.
goodnight little onion that sweet and little sprout using perfect, so, so, the residual moisture and heat is in casing and steaming it, and then with the little noodle nest, i 'm going to give you half the peanut.
i 'm looking at the sauce in the pan.
and i want i do n't want a pool.
so , if that 's all it 's called reduction.
so i 'm just reducing this awesome cooking up, the moisture out of it.
and now you will just roll it around, pull it together, and you just made pads.
i just need to show, i ca n't believe that just it 's really simple.
you save the recipe, and you see all the little bowls and you just wonder OK.
