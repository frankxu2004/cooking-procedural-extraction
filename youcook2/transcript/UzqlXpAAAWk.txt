a cottage pie is a really beautiful comfort food.
but i wanted to make mine with a little bit of difference, i really wanted package with flavor and how i 'm going to do, that is, just add these two ingredients into the mincemeat as uncovered.
this is a steakhouse, marinade.
it 's full of flavor and this list medication everybody has that.
so what i 'm going to do is just start off by boiling potatoes and processors together.
this will give a different type of topping type of mash in the meantime, people going to cook some onions with some bacon for a little while in a pan add the mincemeat and started brown when it 's browning.
add ketchup and your steakhouse, marinade.
cook for fifteen minutes season and set aside when your potatoes and your processor do n't strain them, mash them with some salt pepper milk and butter and put your mincemeat mixture.
which spoon the mash on top of the minutes sprinkle, with some cheddar cheese and put into a hot oven until it 's golden and bubbling and that 's my extra tasty college by you 're going to love this one.
