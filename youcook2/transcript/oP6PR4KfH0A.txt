all right, we 're going to talk about how to make the best onion rings, you 've ever had.
but you want to start off with a really big yellow onion.
the bigger the better when it comes, to onion rings now what we 're going to do is we 're going to cut the onion rings.
really , really thick.
the thicker, the better on this deal, you want, to be careful to watch out for your fingers, though if we do n't cut him completely straight no big deal big onions, little onions that will work.
now we want to push the onions out you want to be careful to try not to break the onion rings if you break him no big deal.
but we 're trying to be traditional here what you wanna do is put the onions in a bowl and.
now we 're going to put water in milk in the bowl about a fifty, fifty mixture what you want to do is make sure your onions are completely submerged in your water milk mixture i use skim milk if you use two percent, or one percent no big deal, we 're going to do.
now set those aside and let him soak for a little bit when cooking just onion rings i use vegetable oil a lot of times cooking turkey like to use peanut oil as you 'll see i 'm using a cast iron pot i really like to use cast iron for cooking.
because it retains heat a lot better and a big oh thermometer the monitors are very important.
because you want to make sure you keep your heat within a certain range right here we 're using the camp chef.
this is a really nice cooker because it 's portable, and it gets really hot.
it will push about sixty thousand btus.
all right now it 's time to get our flower ready, this is pretty complicated.
OK , so pay attention alright flowers done.
what we 're going to do is we 're going to do a two step process on our death.
all this consists of is buttermilk and milk.
it 's about a sixty forty mixture.
it 's really no precise mixture on this.
the more buttermilk you use, and the less milk you 're going to have a thicker batter.
stir it up a little bit with the old leatherman.
not quite to three fifty it got a little ways to go, but it wo n't take long.
that 's for sure alright.
i was n't kidding, about the flower.
it 's very, very simple.
the key to remember is do not put anything in your flower.
OK , you always season afterwards when you fry alright, what we want to do now is, we 're going to take the onions into the flower.
what this process is this process.
is a dry wet, dry process meaning you put the onions in the flower?
first , then you go wet which is into our buttermilk milk mixture and then we 're going to go back into the flower what this does.
it helps ensure a good batter on our onion rings.
you do n't want to better just once.
so we go into the buttermilk back into the flower, and you can kind of see it almost looks like a paper mache plaster.
i mean, that onion it 's back in the flower.
it 's really got a good coat of flour and just looks really, really sticky.
so what we can do now.
is we can now roll the onion rings again in the flower, and our batter is going to be twice as thick again?
you can control the thickness of your batter by either using more buttermilk bless milk.
or you can cut it thinner to where it 's not going to get as thick on the end right there.
that 's a good looking coat, were not too thick or not too thin?
this is an example of a single batter versus.
a double battery.
you can really see that there 's just a lot more reading on the onion with a double batter and again i 'm not saying that we want to get as thick as possible.
i 'm not a fan of an onion ring discovered in lots of battery alright.
we have reached temperature three hundred and fifty degrees into the grease.
we go man.
those are going to be good, and walla they 're done.
now they do n't the onion rings do n't take very long and you can tell that they are done when they turn a nice golden brown and you 'll see the batter kind of start to separate from the union drain the grease off now, here 's the here 's the important part as soon as you pull him out of the grease.
you want to season them immediately.
what this is going to do is going to help the season to stick to the onion ring, but it also helps draw a lot of that grease.
that surface grease out of the engine and the seasoning we 're using is field proven camp shake.
this season is a flavor enhancer.
it 's not very overpowering.
it 's great on everything.
but it actually brings the flavor out of the onion itself, this is a great season you want to kind of flip the onions over and batter both sides.
so that way you get a good coat why, does and is cooled down.
let 's go ahead and throw a few more in the cooker cast.
iron is great for cooking.
it 's very durable and it holds heat.
well , look at that maintain in three fifty no problem.
i like to use a bigger let scoop for getting the onions out.
so that way the onions do n't necessarily just sit in the greece, while you 're trying to pull him out when they 're all done at the same time.
you kind of want to get him out so that way you 're not pawn one at a time.
and they ones that are left in the oil burn.
she 's an important to kentucky from our, so the ice fishing scoop works great as scoop.
not much ice in kentucky.
that 's for sure.
as you can see the batter, it 's got a nice coating a batter, it 's not real thick it 's not like biting into a hush puppy.
you can even see some of the onion expose and the best part is, is witcher?
but rate is C.
is the reason we soak these onions before we cook him is because i despise an onion ring that when you bite into it the onion pulls out?
we do n't want that we want to take a bite and get equal amount of onion and batter.
we do n't want to scold our lips with some onion pulling out of the ring.
incredible dippin sauce down.
really you can use anything you like catch up barbecue sauce.
whatever this here this sauce here i found it dollar general actually is called blossom sauce.
it 's pretty dagan.
good , though, there you go there 's a test of a good onion ring when you bite in the onion, the onion does not pull out my gosh other good that there is field proven seasoning camp shake onion rings give it a try i promise you wo n't be disappointed thanks for watching.
