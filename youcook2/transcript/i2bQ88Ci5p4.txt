when i first heard about boneless chicken wings.
i was like how the heck do they do that, that i saw boneless chicken wing.
and i 'm like, no, that 's a chicken nugget.
oh , my god.
so the boneless wing is basically a small chicken tender.
but bigger than popcorn chicken made without chicken wing meat and pays nothing like a chicken wing.
but that 's OK, because there are amazing to start.
cut up some chicken breast.
me once in half the long way and then slice the other way in two squares then.
so your chicken in a brine solution, which is a combination of water sugar and salt for six hours you 're strapped for time and things, tasting good is n't a priority.
you can skip this step now.
combine the following dry ingredients into a shallow bowl using the cornstarch to make a more protective crispy, coating a similar texture.
you see, with general south chicken.
the wet ingredients is a standard ratio of egg milk and water for our wing sauce most common.
folk also known as plebeians, just add butter to their favorite hot sauce.
but applebee 's has a much thicker creamier consistency.
so if you do n't want that water down oily look at the ingredients listed along with cornstarch to thicken it up makes you whisk thoroughly on medium heat until everything dissolves and get a nice creamy thick texture.
as shown, ah, um taste like applebee 's to me now think your chicken from the brine and toss into your flower code.
it well, and then toss it into your egg, wash.
and we 're going to do this twice to get a thick coating one of the tricks to the breading station, is the keep your dry hand rayan, your wet hand wet or wear gloves.
now for these guys for four minutes to get it partially fried and right before serving, give it an additional two minutes for that extra crispy exterior.
oh , my god i want to rub these on my face OK now once you pour the sauce.
do a big bull video?
several times already.
because i like how it looks toss your chicken into this mixture until fully coated and look.
so good now just grab some of your favorite blue cheese dressing and then add chunks of gorgonzola into it.
and you got yourself chunky blue cheese, serve your chicken on a white plate.
because any other color would be ridiculous or that crumbly blue cheese mixture into a black ramekin that you borrowed from applebee 's at some celery stocks, and you 've got yourself boneless buffalo wings.
just like you can get at the restaurant except not dried out and sitting under a heat lamp for thirty minutes, waitress if we open this barrel.
bombay sapphire, thank you, report them into my phone.
how much summertime i snore too much more or OK more a little bit.
now , i love this healthy junkfood glass.
alright wanna know why we get bones wings because there was half off at applebee 's after nine PM that 's earn in a week.
day is always his great deals.
there are these smell like down the bloody mary, i mean, i know, you do n't think buddy mail with applebee 's food look at this look at the texture on this thing.
it 's just perfect.
when i was making the sauce i told you all earlier this smells like applebee 's sauce do.
you , wanna grab, a fork, and grab one i cutting mine in half.
i know that 's ridiculous.
one , one two are now.
i love chick in.
i 'm going in one bite for the health of it.
this is exactly what we always create when go to applebee 's recipe, you guys have to you have to make these at home on the realsies.
do you have anything that you would change?
i have no objection.
i almost feel like i 'm on the applebee 's.
minus , the fact that we got served on time.
