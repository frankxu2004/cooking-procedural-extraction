higher one and welcome back to SA CS today, we 're going to be making everyone 's favorite.
a margarita pizza homemade pieces.
so fun and exciting to make an after you 've mastered, the basics you can do whatever you want, and add anything on it and just like always only thing we need or a few simple ingredients.
so let 's get started now, the first step we 're going to have to do is rolling out our dough and what that we need to generously flower out or workspace area this is going to help prevent a dough from sticking when we 're rolling it out and.
so now that we have a generous man of flower on the bottom we 're also going to have to add flour to the top there we go just like that, i just simply press with our fingertips working away from the inside out and nice circular motion i 'm just trying to create a nice base circle at the moment and flip it over and doing the same a nice little trick are what i found that helps me a lot whenever i 'm rolling up my deal is this little wine bottle, actually, yeah, music for drink and use it for working there.
you go so you see how this roller back and forth spin it around little has circles and when you get one side moving and coming alive we could just flip it over.
say nice, nice gentle circle.
make sure we had a little bit more flower to the bottom of the cutting board, yeah, it 's going to help prevent it from sticking a little bit more on top as well.
spread it across and right now.
i 'm just going to try to stretch it by hand and just try to balance out.
there 's some sticker, parson thinner parts of the dough.
you , just sort of massage it through different spots.
it 's good to be gentle with it.
but you also want to take control and let the dough know where it needs to move.
hey , yeah, finish it up just like that now.
what i like to do is sprinkle the pizza tray with a bit of semolina.
what this semolina flour is going to do is this going to help this dough to slide on, and off very, very easily.
you see that.
now is how mad this awesome, simply describe a ladle and starting from the middle, working its way from inside out working in a circular motion you can add as much or as little sausage you like i like my pizza nice, and moist.
so my gonna add a little bit more than some people might see those chunks right there that 's a garlic and feet, is gonna be.
so yummy and tasty just explosions of garlic?
now , let 's had are mozzarella cheese.
so , simply just place it on the outside, breaking a nice circle.
nice little ring around it and working its way around, you see, i 'm a native new yorker.
so , of course i like a lot of cheese on mine.
but if you like you could hold back on a bit of cheese, and it 's totally fine.
remember , this is your pizza that you 're going to be making at home.
so that as much in as little, as you like to whichever, you want there, we are just remember make sure we had a little bit of seasoning as well.
there be assault always, everything needs get season and a few cracks of fresh cracked, black pepper.
now the star ingredient to finish this margarita pizza off, is going to be our basil, the red, green and white, symbolize the italian flag.
so make sure that every bite gets a little bit of everything.
there , we go basil also had some really nice refreshing flavor to whatever you 're eating.
and when it roast in a seven right here is going to really whole, are completely different texture flavor?
you 're really going to enjoy it.
i believe and let 's just had one more for good measure right in the middle where there.
we go perfect and there.
she is good old beautiful margarita pizza.
let 's get ready to put her in the oven.
so in a four hundred and seventy five degree oven, i 'm just gonna put this in my pizza stone, and the semolina is really helping this come off very smoothly, place that in mary are put it in, let it hang out for about eight minutes should be perfect.
some ovens are different.
but checkers about eight minutes and check this out, oh, yeah, here that this, i got a really nice crust that are bottom of it, as well, look at this gooeyness.
