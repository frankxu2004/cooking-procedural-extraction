brothers and sisters food busker, kraken, the shore.
and for those of you that do n't speak french like more, that 's a pot ham and cheese toasty.
but rather than going with one piece of hand we 're going to double it up with two that 's a double harry i 'll come on, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry four hundred mills of white béchamel sauce in there and i 'm going to add an egg yolk.
now the reason that you add an egg is that it 's just going to help with the color when you brown it in the pantry also helps to sort of thicken up the béchamel, a bit more.
now i 'm going to add a hundred grams of gruyere cheese.
and we 're just going to great that in OK salt and pepper, you can cooperate those right and then let 's just add a little great of nutmeg.
i could just dance and cook right that 's great.
the nutmeg not meg in the area or just mix that in done, OK, so now let 's get the bread ready.
right little bit of oil, which is going to drizzle the tops turn on now.
let 's toast him.
let 's get some honey roasted ham on then a little greater cheese, then more back not.
the parma ham so last bitter bash and then the final bit is a little bit of béchamel on the top now before we drop it in.
i 'm going to put a little piece of greaseproof in there that 's going to stop it from burning, but it 's going to allow it to brown.
tip , right that 's gonna mean right.
we just want to cook them until all that beautiful béchamel starts brown.
it 's about two to three minutes look out flipping delicious.
