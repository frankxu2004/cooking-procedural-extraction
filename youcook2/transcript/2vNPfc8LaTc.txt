today , we 're making a bacon grilled cheese here on cooking with bacon.
here 's what is going to look like pretty rad, so i 'm going to start with four strips of bacon in a pan.
i 'm just going to fold each of these back.
ever so slightly, and we 're going to leave another four strips of bacon cross these, so for everyone we 're going to start by you, flipping it over.
and then we 're going to pull the other sides.
and i 'm just using a V formation for each of these strips.
you 're going to notice they 're all in the same formation, make sure that the vise lineup.
so that you do n't have two ends together otherwise it 's just makes a weak point in your sandwich.
also , by having four strips of bacon across we 're going to make it nice and easy to fold it down the middle.
pretty brilliant right.
so i 'm showing you the full fold on this one because, you know, i get lazy sometimes and other videos and do n't feel like narrating the whole thing.
but here we are this is the full fold for it does all the back and forth.
we have our sandwich halfway done here.
so i 'm just continuing with this notice.
it gets pretty easy at the end, you do n't have to fold over the whole strip of bacon anymore.
and we 're just doing the exact same thing as before.
exact same thing pretty easy.
you could do that at home.
i just did.
so we 're on our last trip, a bacon here.
we 're just going to throw this puppy down, fold some ends over.
pull this third strip down here there you are good job ross.
OK , so now we 're just going to pull over the end, pull over an goodenough, goodenough there.
we are there.
we are not just slip that puppy, down.
oh , what a beauty, what a beauty.
fold the ends over.
and we 're done.
OK , so cook this for about fifteen minutes over medium heat, flipping once until it looks like this great.
the bacons almost finished cooking, but not quite completely crisp.
this is where we throw on the cheese.
i 'm using white cheddar pretty easy.
we 're going to cover this for a few minutes until it 's nice and starting to melt like this now using tongues in a metal knife.
i 'm just going to fold the sandwich over i'ma, degrease it and throw it on the plate there.
you are fake and grilled.
cheese , what a lovely invention.
i 'm christian mcmahan.
and this is cooking with bacon.
