so these are the ingredients.
we 're going to need to make the burritos.
we 're going to get about a cup of shredded cheese, a cup of rice and using the minute brown rice and a can of refried beans.
i 'm using vegetarian, a quarter cup of salsa, any variety that you like about a tablespoon of chocolate whose name and eat flour tortillas the first thing you 're going to do is cook your rice.
and it might just took five minutes and i did cook it in some chicken broth.
because it gives it a little extra flavor.
but it really does n't make that big of a difference.
so , yes, you just wanna get your rice cooked and you do want to have it.
and then you can start getting everything else ready.
then all you need to do is pour all of your ingredients into a large bowl and stir them around until they are all mixed.
together completely also, you 'll want to have your oven preheated to four hundred and fifty degrees alright.
next all you 'll need to do is start filling your burritos.
so i went ahead and lined baking sheet with tinfoil.
so i 'm just folding, my last burrito and it did make all eight of them this is the last one it 's a little bit small.
but it 's alright.
so what i do is just pulled in each end, like this, and then just fold the other way it 's kind of a tiny one.
but there is all eight of the burritos and, then i 'm going to cook them before at a time at four fifty before i put it in the oven, i 'm just going to spray them with some cooking oil really fast, just over the tops alright, then i 'm gonna bake, them for about five to seven minutes, and then i 'm going to flip him over spray them again and bake them for another five minutes alright.
so these banks for five minutes, and i just slipped from over.
so that they can brown on the other side.
i 'm going to put them back in for about three more minutes or until there brown on both side.
so those clip for three more minutes and the backs thought a little more brown and then the top scott just slightly browned.
so if you want them even brown, or you can just leave them in a little bit longer and they 'll darken up on each side.
so now i 'm just going to go ahead and put the second batch in an ivory sprayed the pin and the burritos.
and they 're just going to go back in for five minutes, and then probably another three minutes just like the other right so here 's the finished thing.
i have it cut open.
so you can see the inside the shell is slightly crispy.
and then it 's just warm.
so i hope you enjoy this video.
and i will talk to you soon bye?
do you think that 's great?
is it, yeah, how much how one number is it?
how much good is it.
seven or ten scale upsetting the ten tenors really good and seven cents a little bit, good, let 's attend what did you think.
