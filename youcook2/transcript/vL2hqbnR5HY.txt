did i guys very easy recipe today?
you will need two snags now.
here i 'm going to italian sausages, but you can use whichever ones.
you want, of course, got some freshly chopped chives.
of course, we chopped onion a bit of butter.
some potatoes have been peeled and chopped up into smaller pieces.
some olive oil, some milk some corn flour some chicken stock, and a bit of salt and pepper.
now we 're going to start with the gravy.
because it will take the longest.
because we are caramel, icing some onions.
so into a pain i 'm going to add some oil and that chopped onion and we 're just going to let this cook on a low heat it 's going to take about half an hour or.
so guys, and you want to resist the temptation to stir it, too often every five minutes or.
so should do it if it starts to burn turn it down if they take on a burnt flavor you have to start again.
so once the caramelised and this is going to put a bit of that chicken stock into a cup to mix with corn flour and the rest of it into the saucepan with the onions and one sets up to a syma i 'm just going to mix a bit of corn flour in with the cold stock and just add it in there guys and stir for about a minute or so, until it starts to thicken and then just leave it off to one side to simmer and cook down a bit.
so well what 's happening, we 're going to get those sausages started and we 'll get into the mesh.
now here, hold these potatoes for about twelve minutes, or.
so they are soft and while it 's still hot add that butter in and start matching.
now we 're just going to ashleys until that butter is melted all the way through it then we 're just going to add a bit of salt a bit of pepper with throwing the chives and just a bit of milk cause you 're better off pulling less in the start with then they add more.
if you need it, then put too much into start with.
so just a little bit at a time and just work that through with dementia another point with meshes.
it 's important not to over matter so our gravies done.
our mash is done and now sausages are done.
so ready to plate it up guys, and they have it needs absolutely awesome.
it 's very easy to make you want to give this ago guys thanks for tuning in.
and i 'll catch you guys next time.
