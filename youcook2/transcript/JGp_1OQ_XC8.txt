i feel like people like to order muscles at restaurants, but they do n't usually make them in their home because they 're scared of them.
and they 're so easy.
it 's actually think of them like shrimp or, you know, even clams they are so simple and beautiful.
so i came up with this recipe because i just love garlic and white wine that quintessential french flavoring.
this is the perfect sauce for muscles.
they steam and absorb all those flavors, and dipping the bread in is like heaven.
it is so good.
i could drink this stuff like suit so muscles you want to take him out of the fridge and rinse them in water.
the beard of a muscle is sometimes attached and it basically looks like this, scraggly piece of lint or something on the outer shell.
it 's pretty easy to take off.
but you just have to give it some gas to throw the onion and garlic in some butter and olive oil and get that going in your pot to release all that yummy fragrance fresh, flavoring, saute it for a few minutes and then add the wine in along with the muscles, discard any mussels that are already opened.
that means that they are not good to cook with cover.
the pot and those are going to steam for just about three to five minutes.
what i do is i like to buy a big country style.
and then grill it for about three minutes per side.
so kids that nice charmer gone there after the muscles are done.
i bring him to the table in my big leg, who say answer amount of that you can easily want to a big platter or an individual bowls.
but make sure to give lots of rocks to people.
because that 's the best part.
serve it alongside with the bread for dipping and sprinkle it with fresh parsley, and fresh lemon slices, it is heaven in a dish.
