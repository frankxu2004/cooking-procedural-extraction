so i actually start flipping the eggs on top of each other at this point.
i turned the heat off in the eggs.
they look like their low undercooked, but they 're fine.
they 're going to actually cook through with the residual heat that 's in the pan.
after about few moments, you 're going to go ahead and transfer that onto your plate.
