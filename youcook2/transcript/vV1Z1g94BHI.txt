we need to make a minestrone soup.
so we need off, chopped onion to be carrots also chopped and two branches of celery chopped as well as bunch of basil, half cauliflower, one broccoli is small size.
a can of mixed beings and then a nice big cleaner chopped then pepper salt nice extra virgin.
olive oil, in a beautiful freeze of fresh parmesan cheese, then we need to use these tomato source.
you can find this everywhere in the world.
is the best tomato sauce in the world at my grandmother, uses it use this one?
otherwise it does n't turn the way patterns.
then we need to use some chopped as well, one, one potato chopped one vegetable cube stock, and then you had half leader of out water.
this is a nice piece of chunks steak, but you can also use also boco but make sure you get rid of the fact.
you do n't want any fat in it.
this is for all of you who do n't know how to cook, make sure you surprise your loved one and make this very easy recipes.
everyone will love especially in winter, so let 's put about four tablespoons of extra virgin olive.
oil make sure you breed the pot on a medium heat and the partners would be nice and big, now.
let 's put the onion in the pot.
the carrots and the celery.
and we do this.
we cooking for about three minutes in the medium heap and then we had a little bit of water.
let 's put about a half glass of water so we do n't burn the onion now.
let 's cut the chunks take into small pieces.
we want to get this piece maybe about this big, so that 's what we want to do is OK now.
we 're going to play the meat in the pot.
so now we cook it for about five minutes until the meat becomes nothing brown.
let 's chopped cauliflower into nice pieces.
you want the broccoli will be almost the same size as the cauliflower.
my wife normally cuts the vegetables into the same pieces.
they all look design.
unfortunately ca n't do that, so i 'm very sorry.
this , and i know you will get upset when you see this now.
it 's time to play the finally chopped tomato in here.
this smell is taking me back to italy to my grandmother 's kitchen, AH, yeah, now let 's do it now.
it 's time for us to place everything in the pot.
so we start from the cauliflower and broccoli, yeah, beautiful, never place that bikini then we want to play the sweet potato.
oh , yeah, the smell is nice even though is windy and now we have beans.
i will say shop some basil just with a hand like this.
now we play the stock so it gets familiar with a vegetable stir.
it well, now, we 're going to add about one and a half liters of water and make sure everything is covered.
if you need more water if you need two raiders.
as long you cover everything, now, this is a must in my grandmother recipe, and it 's a mass for me, as well.
you should be able to find in any good italian delicatessen.
the scheme of the parmesan cheese, they should sell it for you now.
let 's get the screen into small pieces.
it 's gonna be nice and hard.
so you need to press, and we met cube and another one.
now let 's place these in, in there.
this will give extra flavors to the minestrone.
then , we add some salt and pepper.
now we stir it gently.
properly , when you make sure everything is, is getting together and then we 're going to do?
we 're going to cover it and cook it for at least two hours on end million, slow it, and.
now basically we have two hours to do what we want to do.
but remember every half an hour.
maybe going stairs do n't forget now.
let 's do what you like to do who.
sorry guys i fall asleep.
thank you bill for us during this for maine.
let 's see, this melts that smell the smell, oh, my god two hours of cooking it was definitely worth it take a look inside, have a look here this is this method you want this is the importance of cooking slow two hours to make this you get a flavor slow it, and that 's the best thing you can do you cook this enough an hour is going to become early yuck, you do n't want to know what it is not fast food guys slow food.
now let 's put it in the plate and, and see how beautiful it is an aisin rich.
now what you can do twelve minutes before you actually serve it, while still boring you can add this faster about hundred and fifty grams of this, this is my favorite faster for the minister on it.
you put in there in ice absorbs more water.
and then you can serve it actually with minister on it today.
i did n't do it, but you can do it if you do n't want to make it with me.
