how 's it going.
welcome to my virgin kitchen.
today , i will show you how to make corndogs.
times they look amazing, write an artifact, ashwin and brynna for suggesting that i make corn dogs with the super bowl, coming up, is pretty much no brainer you 're going to love these.
now being british, i do n't really know too much about the super bowl or have a video game in madden one basically quite good it just throwing the ball everywhere.
did n't know what i was doing?
but i win which was kind of cool, but i put a joke out on facebook earlier, saying you can get amazing gambling odds on the chicago.
bulls win the superbowl.
i will see their basketball team.
it kind of backfired which was british humor.
i do know a little bit about it.
i spent four summers of my life out in america over my american family, cindy and sammy quite a corn dog is a good thing, 'cause these are amazing.
so i really hope you give me troy, get porn video.
now work these ingredients down this side.
first up i got my frankfort is, and set them on kitchen towel to make sure they were fully dry him here.
comes the painful bit.
i inserted a bamboo skewer all the way into the frankfurter, so it was nice and easy to hold for all the guys.
watching sorry about that step with the frankfurt is all inserted put them to one side, and it 's time to make our batter.
sober makes involved and combine your flower.
polenta , which is also known as cornmeal salt and baking powder into that bowl and just mix it all together until it 's nice and combined at in your beaten egg and half of your milk, stirring it initially and then, add the rest of it and continue to stir until you 've got a lovely smooth batter now.
make sure my battle was nice and clean.
kinda like an ex boyfriend or girlfriend that just ca n't let go i transferred my batter into a jug and then placed in a fridge, while i got on heating up.
so over a medium flame on a hub i whacked down my pan winter.
vegetable oil getting it up to temperature with the oil in the pan.
nice and hot, i found it super easy to grab a nice tool glass, stick my sausage in it.
i know that sounds wrong will just skip over that bit port in there.
chill batter and any access at the top.
it did n't make are just spoon at that extra batter on top until it was fully coated or then satin semi.
pan of oil, and then it just roll around for three or four minutes until it 's nice and golden brown before sitting it on kitchen towel, and all i did was repeat.
those steps will remain in frankfurt this or even just hold on a little bit of mustard and i was n't really sure what people normally have on these i 've seen, mustard is quite popular avenue corndog let me know down below, but, i think my friends super easy all my brother oh, my goodness guys i can see why these are.
so popular there pretty darn, amazing, you got it should read foamy crunchy layer on the outside just down cut enough mix them well, without mustard, so, please let me know if this passes your american seal of approval, and what you put on yours if you enjoy this video do n't forget you have thumbs up share.
so it 's quite common to all that stuff good luck with the super bowl if you cheer on the chicago bulls like, i am, wink good times guys see.
