welcome back to your brain.
upset drunk chef.
T i 'm going to make a beef pulling up boring also.
i think you said before, you know, before going up before, you know, before you beef burgundy or before he was, one of the things in this bathroom vision and.
so the first thing i want to do is turn oven on to three hundred and fifty next, we had to cut some bacon today is.
so bad here is piece of pork.
belly smoke pork belly that i cut into order of thickness.
i want, so i 'm gonna cut about six pieces that they can offer this, and then i 'm going to say this mexican two yellow onions, and i 'm going to break these down, and iceland, who 's your busy play sunday.
next , i just have today 's couple karats.
so here i have my dutch oven.
what we do is just heat this over medium high heat, and i 'm going to brown my bacon.
i want to hear is some beef chuck which cut up until like an inch and a half cubes.
i put kosher salt on it and pepper ann.
i 'm basically just going to put in the pot for like, forty five minutes.
so it browns on all sides.
but not all of it will do have a time.
so i 'm going to add my carrots in my onion into the box, and i 'm just going around these for about four minutes.
can you reduce my heat down to low in here?
i 've got three tablespoons of flour, which i 'm basically just customer go laptop and starting for about a minute.
OK , OK, so my flowers incorporate wanna.
do is add my beef back in, and all my banking vacuum, as well, i take it off and he wo n't get here, is a quarter cup of brandy.
if you can do this, and you should do it, do n't burn your house down?
i do n't want to hear what you want.
bring your house that pull the flame back away from your face that was OK, that was totally panting.
come back so, so i 've got my still like medium low tonight, i 'm going to add three cups of red wine.
something full body is like a burgundy would be great but until body will work at a couple half of beef.
stock tablespoon of tomato paste bay leaves, and i had five cloves of garlic and that 's the new alignment for about two hours at three hundred fifty degrees.
so my brain is just about done.
warm doing here is, i 'm just melting down a couple of tablespoons of butter.
and once it 's totally melted i 'm going to add a bunch of mushrooms, OK song i add my cut mushrooms to that.
so basically i sate these to their brown, but five minutes kaylee to look at pretty good i just have more of those off into a bull.
add another tablespoon, and i had some pearl onions that you can get frozen, you can use frozen.
otherwise , you get some fresh just make sure it 's sort of blank transfer.
cook him a little took him a little bit.
so i 'm going to compete for about five minutes until they brown up a little bit.
and then we 're going to just a little bit of water and goes on the further.
it will be good to go.
so let me do something.
i have half a cup of water.
does it my cover it and cover for about three to four minutes, so, and once that 's done, we can add to our mushrooms.
and then we 'll go to our praise so my brain should be done here.
i 'm just going to take a little look.
i 'm gonna add those along with my mushrooms really drink.
