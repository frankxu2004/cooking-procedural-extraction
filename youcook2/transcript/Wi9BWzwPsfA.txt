hey guys, this is jackie.
i 'm going to be showing you very quickly how i make my favorite sandwich, first of all, i 'm going to use some real butter, and i 'm just going to melt that in the pan, OK, that butter is melted.
so now i 'm going to add my texas tolls which is my favorite bread, is nice and thick, it has spices in it, it has no preservatives and this is my favorite bread now.
usually i use the bread sticks which is what i have right here are using for spaghetti, or any kind of italian dish.
so just going to put the bread in the pan.
and i 'm going to use the sharp cheddar cheese paper because it has the most flavor.
and i 'm going to use the mozzarella cheese for my favorite sandwich, and i 'm going to place the sharp cheddar cheese down and the mozzarella.
and now i 'm going to use my favorite pizza sauce.
this sauce was voted the best new product by better homes and garden and it actually you could taste the spices in it.
and this sauce is D licious.
so i 'm just going to spread that over the cheese now, i have pepperoni right here.
you can also use turkey pepperoni for lower fat version and low fat turkey.
and i 'm just going to place that pepperoni on top of that sauce very quickly, and i 'm going to add some more mozzarella cheese.
at this point, you can add a turkey chicken.
mushrooms , onions black olive whatever you want on your sandwich, you could make it anyway.
you want an i 'm just going to put the bottom on top.
i 'm going to put it together, and i 'm just going to let that sizzle and simmer until the cheese is melted and nice, and gooey, i like my cheese running an i like my cheese to spread an stringy cheese so, i 'm just going to, to keep turning that around.
so that the bottom of it will not burn OK.
and my sandwich is done all the cheese, is melted?
look how that she 's just stretches out now go.
make you want.
i want to thank you for watching until the next video bye.
i love you.
