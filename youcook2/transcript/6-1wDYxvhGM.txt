hi , everybody, this is diana from sweetie solo and today we 're making carnitas tacos with cilantro lime sauce now.
these carnitas are a little bit different.
because we 're not going to marinate them with a lot of ingredients were just going to roast them in the oven and bring out the natural flavor of the meat which is the way they make them at my favorite mexican restaurant , in.
trust me, these are incredible as always, the link for this recipe is going to be available at the end of the video, the info box below.
first , we 're going to make our cilantro lime sauce and for that we 're going to need some cilantro that we 're going to put in a food processor.
we 're also going to add some jalapeno garlic powder onion powder cumin.
some lime juice, and we 're also going to add some claimant, making gonna or mexican table cream.
if you ca n't find this, you can use just heavy whipping cream if you want.
and then we 're going to add a little bit of mail going to cover.
and then we 're going to process until smooth now.
we 're going to season with a little bit of salt, then, we process again to make sure everything is well blended.
and then we 're going to store it in the fridge to make our carnitas.
we 're going to need a pork shoulder roast.
this one still has the bone and all we have to do is stream off the fat.
if you do n't want to trim off the fact.
that 's OK because this is completely optional.
we 're also going to remove the skin and when i remove the skin.
i also remove a little bit of meat dislike this because i save it to make other colombian recipes such as colombian beans.
tamales in lentilles the next thing, we 're going to do is, we 're going to cut this pork shoulder in half because it 's very thick right now.
we get it right in the middle, and we 're also going to remove the bone now when i remove the bone.
i also like to leave a little bit of meat on the bone because i save it to make other recipes such as sancocho and pork stew.
then we 're going to season are meet with a little bit of salt.
we 're going to put it in a roasting pan or baking dish and then we add a little bit of water.
then we 're going to bake it at three hundred and seventy five degrees for about an hour and after an hour.
this is what they look like then, we 're going to turn them over.
and we 're going to bake them again at four hundred and fifty degrees for about thirty minutes, turning them over every five to eight minutes until they 're golden brown on the outside once there done.
we 're going to put him on a cutting board and then we 're going to shred them with a couple forks.
