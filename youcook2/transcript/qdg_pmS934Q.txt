starla shoulders these are celery and are red apple to the right of that.
i 've got a touch of honey.
i 'm in a real small amount, you can use sugar if you want to the left.
i 've got some chops flat.
leaf parsley about salt and pepper about some mayonnaise, some lemon juice and some walnuts.
so , simply the honey lemon, the mayonnaise and the salt and pepper together to make a dress in.
and then we 're going to just rub the rest of it all together let 's do.
it , so as you can see i 've got a small little bold here.
i 've added salt and pepper and that tiny little bit of hand and now going to add my lemon juice and my mayonnaise.
small size, salad, today, but what we do have here, is going to give us a little mix?
why mixing what we do have is about four to five parts of mayonnaise.
one part of lemon probably half a part of the honey just a little tiny amount that was you can play around with it a little bit unit.
how you want, but, that is the desired effect.
a nice smooth lemony, sweet mayonnaise, let 's move on so very simplistic server mixing bone out my sellers in there, my apples in there, of course.
that and put into sort chunks like that site.
exactly how you want i 've put some of my passing inside, and i put some of my nuts inside the balance.
