let 's make some chicken minestrone in my big pot.
i 've got a little bit of olive oil and see that i 'm adding in one brown onion, which i 've just chopped up a little bit of crushed garlic.
two sticks of celery which i 'm just chopped up and two large carrots which i 've just peeled.
and chopped i 'm also adding in a hundred and fifty grams of dice of bacon, and you could make this bacon ham pancetta or whatever you fancy.
and over a medium to high heat we 're just going to turn this around and allow this to cook for about five to ten minutes or until the onions have softened.
adding a four hundred gram can of diced tomatoes and i chopped up to zucchini or courgettes, depending on where you live in the world i 'm going to add in eight cups of chicken stock that 's two liters and two cups of cold water.
give this a good stir now just allow this to come to the boil next.
we 're going to add in some rissone about half a cup in arizona, is just this pastor that looks a bit like rice, and when we add this into a soup, it 'll suck up a little bit of the excess liquid, and it will add a bit of body to our mixture and last.
but not least, i 've got some chicken about four cups of cooked chicken i just bought a roasted chicken from the supermarket and all i 'm going to do is just check this in you strip all the meat off the chicken discard.
the skin and bones and then just roughly shred it up into little bits do n't be too fussy with it.
give that a big stir season, with pepper and we 're going to do is reduce the temperature down to low, just so our soup is just gently simmering.
we 're going to allow it to simmer for about ten minutes or so, or until that pastor has swelled up, and is nice and tender and actually can minestrone is just about ready and take a look at this, this beautiful chicken and vegetables and pastor.
