i grew up having this at least once a week.
i 'm really, really excited to try this, so we 're actually starting these are frozen.
fava beans, and really important paper towel underneath.
because moisture is your nemesis here when you 're making falafel.
because the least amount of moisture means the least amount of flower means the least amount of dominus waffle.
if they have chopped garlic to add that green onions that have been chopped chili flake is again.
this is a very rich product.
here we have human that we toasted, and ground, tablespoon assault.
and i added a little bit of english peas, but we 're not going to over mix this OK.
i wanted a little chunky.
i love the color of the peas and father.
this is all about consistency and flavor.
obviously , always flavor.
you 're sure thank you.
so i like i want to make sure that those spices are coming through.
make sure you get a little garlic remember it will mellow out a little bit 'cause you 're going to pan fried in oil.
i love it.
and it has a good spice to it has a good spice to it.
and so what we 're going to do now is we 're just going to go ahead and scoop this.
and we 're going to test one see how firm i 'm going here on the side 'cause i 'm packing it right in, in there, and you would just scoop all of these and go ahead and let him set up in the refrigerator for about an hour before you start cooking am is this something that you could do ahead of time.
if you 're entertaining to how long you could leave this overnight awesome in the fridge in see, i just really padded it down.
i kept that nice shape that it had, yeah, and i 'm going to put it in here.
so we 're just going to code this is that the thickness that we 're looking it is that 's exactly the thickness.
you 're looking for.
and that 's a great question because you can see.
it 's about half an inch thick.
i 'm going to go ahead and just drop it in there.
and we tasted the mix.
so all we 're really doing now is checking for the fact that it sticks together, so we 're going to scoop a few of these OK michelle.
so now i 'm going to flip by falafel.
this is absolutely one of those.
you never overload your pants.
all the time all the time.
and i actually did pretty much what you 're doing, yeah, this is this would be a really fun job for a kid.
i 'm sure and you can see this is a we did.
great michelle, oh, that looks gorgeous growing up in a middle eastern family.
everything that we ate at home.
we everything had thai spice high acid, hi sweetness high fat content in it.
so , that 's kind of where my love for balanced food came from so.
i 'm going to squeeze some lemon on here just to give it a little acidity because this is rich.
i 'm going to eat on this one.
i was gonna tell you better get in on this.
they 're really flaky.
michelle , you did agree.
i , i could tell by the sound when we 're getting into this hum not dry.
and they fall apart.
that 's what you want right there, see how it crumbles, that 's what you want, and really i wish your mom.
we 're here together a giant, had she asked me whether peas are doing it?
this is incredible.
and i really feel like i 'm getting to know you a little more by eating these foods that you grew up with.
well , whenever you 're ready to go to ellensburg, washington , michelle.
we can have my mom do it.
i would love that.
