hey guys welcome back to dragons TV.
this is dragon and today.
i 'm doing a cooking video and guess while making today me.
you got it, it 's nan or non one of my favorite flatbread, so what we would need is one teaspoon of yeast.
one tablespoon sugar, half a cup of warm water three tablespoons, soy milk.
one teaspoon salt in about two cups or bread, flour and two tablespoons of olive oil.
OK , let 's make it go.
so , i know lukewarm water.
we 're gonna go ahead and add the east.
at the east.
then , we 're gonna go ahead and add the sugar, just a little bit to help activate the east.
how we gonna mix it well, and do n't worry about the lumps.
it should be OK, that is, set for ten minutes, OK, in the meantime we 're gonna go ahead and shift the bread flour.
i had divided the bread flour into two parts.
the first part is a cup and a half, which i 'm shifting right now, and the second one is a half a cup.
i 'd like to go ahead and divide them.
so it 's easy to mix the wet with the dry ingredients.
so go ahead and shift until all the lumps are gone.
and then we 're going to add the rest of the ingredients here.
is the sugar salt, an outlet that yet the soy milk i 'm going to make a little hole and put the soy milk in the middle and the olive oil.
go ahead and clean the workstation.
we night we like a nice work station outdoor.
forget your yeast at the yeast mixture into the bowl, an mix, well, i like to use my hands.
i do n't mind getting dirty.
i 'll be if you do n't like getting your hands sticky.
how you can use a spatula or wooden spoon and go ahead and add the rest of the bright flower.
and we 're going to mix it well, go ahead and dump the whole thing on onto your workspace to start kneading and take out all of the good dough and start needing.
i like to just fold it and press it down for their impressive down.
and there is no correct way how you can do it the way.
you want to.
but this is how i do it, are you going to go ahead and need this for about six to eight minutes or until it 's incorporated, evenly if you using electric mixer probably about three to four minutes.
so here is my dough beautiful.
OK , we 're going to go ahead and get a clean bowl and spray oil.
or you can dab it oil onto a napkin and just wipe the bowl.
well , go ahead and spray on top as well.
we 're gonna cover this for one hour to rise, or until it doubles let me get something to cover here OK alrighty, see you back in an hour.
OK , here 's my dough about an hour later, i should have at least doubled in size, and we 're going to go ahead and sprinkle some flour onto the working surface, and this is how i divide my those, i like to go ahead and pinch and pull, i just pinch and pool, i 'm making six nand medium sized near if you wanted a bigger size you 'll probably want to make four pieces.
because it does smaller you care.
you wo n't be able to stretch it too much.
you 're going to go ahead and cover again and let it rise for about ten minutes.
so , after ten minutes take one of the small doe ann.
you 're gonna start.
rolling out the dough now today.
i 'm using a glass, i did n't have a rolling pin when i did this video so just using what i have.
do n't judge OK, so we 're going to roll it out?
ask not thinly as you want just pull it out like you make a pizza.
make sure you do n't pull out too much.
wanna , whole in your breath, so something like this.
so , after thirty minutes, arising, you 're going to take a pan and preheat it on medium high.
you 're going to go ahead and pat the flatten dough with water.
an place it on the pan on.
if you do n't have a non stick pan, make sure you grease the pan before putting the door down you, going to cook each side about two to three minutes on each side, and then you 'll notice that there 's going to be bubbles that comes up and then you 'll know to start flipping just as if you were making pancake.
so if you can see there 's a bubble actually forming or starting to form on the dough, and it 's gonna be about a minute to flip it over to the other side.
OK , so i 've when i had an flipped on both sides and then.
so if you notice there 's a nicely brown charge on east side of the dell and, once you 're done with that you 'll put it aside an, i like to brush it with melted butter you can also use olive oil, or you can just leave it plain sometimes i like just leaving it plain is not necessary to actually brush anything on these there as good as they are by themselves so.
so here we go.
so thank you guys for watching this video and i know i have n't put out a lot of cooking video for awhile and i, i hope that i can get more out pretty soon.
so thank you again till.
next time this is dragon bye.
