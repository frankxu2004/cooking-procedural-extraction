hi , my name is justin wangler on the executive chef at kendall jackson winery and today were preparing one of my favorite dishes grilled.
calamari you often see it fried and lots of restaurants, but kinda underutilized as a grilled product gets an amazing carmel ization and just really wonderful flavor.
so today we 're pairing the dish with kendall jackson, vintners reserve pinot, nawar grapefruit flavor.
in this one cherries cranberry, a little bit of earthiness, the salad that we 're making is going to kind of pull in those cherry flavors in the earthy notes found in the pinot.
we 've been great with ingredient called uhm a plum paste.
it 's from pickled, plums from japan along with some pinot, nawar virtue and pomegranate, molasses and all those are great red fruit characteristics that will really tie in with fina norwalk.
so to get started.
we 're going to start with some clean calamari, and we 're going to marinate it in a little bit of olive oil some fresh thyme little bit of salt and i 'm going to smash some garlic cloves up there, give it a good whack.
there quickload shop men, in here.
and we 're also going to add a spice called sumac consume acts one of my favourites spices from the mediterranean.
it works really, well, with pinot, nawar and sarrah.
it 's got a sour kind of red berry cranberry flavor to it.
we 're just going to season that, and this you could do, even the night ahead of time it 's just going to get more flavor into it.
so we 'll just give this a little talk in the meantime we 're gonna that there 's off to the side, and.
now we 're going to melon ball, some potatoes and pretty simple to do, you just want to take the melon baller.
we got some water over here.
we 're just going to add that to boiling salted water.
those are going to take about eight minutes to cook next.
we want to assemble the vinaigrette, and we 're going to start by using a little bit of that, you may plum base here.
it 's pretty strong.
it 's salty is sweet and sour.
it 's got with the japanese, calling mommy.
it 's the fifth flavor sense, so there 's a lot going on.
there were going to add a little bit of soy sauce next rice wine vinegar.
pinot , noir version.
you then, we 're going to add a little bit of mirren, which is a japanese sweet cooking wine, a little sesame E paste which is often used in tahini, pomegranate, molasses give it a little pinch assault there.
and we 're just going to whisk in the sesame E oil.
really , really fragrant, a lot of big flavors going on here.
we 're just going to add a little bit of olive oil.
it 's pretty much a vinaigrette.
an we will go into grilling the kalmar next so calamari could 've marinated overnight.
we got a nice hot smoking grill pan.
and we 're just going to add the calamari in calamari is one of those things that you want to either cook it really fast or really.
slow , so we 're just going to put these in here, and they 're going to take just a couple minutes to cook.
we 're going to the tentacles as well, there and i begin to brown on one side and then will flip it in the meantime.
we 're going to add some cherries and get a little carmel ization on them.
they just have a little bit of olive oil on them.
we 're just going to brown the potatoes in a little butter.
just a little bit of salt and the, the sumac you can really smell it in the air.
it kind of smells toasty and, nutty and little bit of a cranberry aroma.
cherries are looking good, and we 're just going to give the calamari of rough chop, we can actually throw the tentacles right in the ball, kind of, bite sized pieces.
you can pop the cherries off and into the bowl as well, while the cowboy.
so now the potatoes have become golden brown, and we 're just going to add those to the bowl with the rest of the ingredients at this point we just need to give the saladita check it for seasoning.
then , we can put it up and taste it with a pinot, noir and see the lettuce is warmed up and welt it a little bit.
so we just make a little pile out in the middle there.
some calamari in the front.
it 's kind of nice.
rustic dish, really nice, smoky sweet salty.
so many flavors going on in this nice crisp acidity of the pinot just kind of pulls it all together.
