hi , everyone, my name is lila and welcome to my kitchen.
i hope everyone had a wonderful new years, i know in my last video, i had mentioned that had gone down to palm beach.
but i also went to new jersey to spend some time with my family during christmas as well.
so now i 'm very far behind, and i need to get caught up.
and i also wanted to do some videos for chinese knew year, which is coming up on january twenty.
third , i believe today, i 'm gonna be making some pot stickers.
now i have another pot, sticker recipe, which has the meat filling.
but these are vegetarian pot stickers for those of you who do n't eat meat.
so let 's go ahead and get started on this recipe for this recipe.
i 'm using a fourteen ounce bag of coleslaw mix, a package of pot sticker wrappers, if you 're vegan, make sure to get the ones without the egg.
a fifteen ounce.
can of straw mushrooms stir fry oil, which has the flavors of garlic green onion and ginger already infused in it sesame E oil and garlic salt, first drain the can of mushrooms, and then chop them into smaller pieces.
next heating nonstick pot on high and add two tablespoons up the stir fry oil?
when the oil is hot and the coleslaw mix mushrooms and a half, a teaspoon of garlic salt stir fry for about six to seven minutes or until the cabbage becomes soft, make sure to stir constantly.
so that the cabbage does not brown then remove it from the heat and let it cool down about fifteen minutes.
once the filling is cool, then it 's time to fill our rappers place the rapper on a plate or work surface, add summative filling, then using your finger wet the edges with a little bit of water, then fold it in half.
delete the outer edge, and then pleat the entire top edge using your index finger as a guide pleat.
the end and press firmly to seal then place the finished pot sticker on a plate and continue wrapping the rest.
once all of the rappers are filled heat a large nonstick pot that has a tight fitting lid on medium, high add one tablespoon of sesame E oil and spread it around evenly, using a paper towel, then at about fifteen to twenty pot stickers, keep in mind that you want to space them out.
so that you do n't overcrowd the pot, you may only be able to add ten or.
so depending on the size of your pot.
next at a half a cup of water cover and let them cook for eight minutes, or until the water boils out.
then remove the lid and let it cook one more minute, then carefully remove them from the pot and serve enjoy for complete ingredients and instructions click the link below.
