hi guys, today, we 're going to make some easy oven fried chicken.
this is like my third time, recording this video.
i keep deleting parts, and just up it 's a nightmare, but anyway wash and dryer chicken.
the next, we 're just going to add some seasoning mix.
you can go to my blog and get all the measurements as always.
i have like some seasoning salt.
some poultry seasoning cajun seasoning this all kinds of little spices in there.
and for excuse me half the mixture on the chicken OK not just have the seasoning mixture on the chicken.
and then use your hands to kind of, you know, distribute the seasonings just like that.
mix it up.
and i almost forgot the africa.
oops , gotta put some in there.
i do n't put the pop rica in my flour mixture because it can kind of make your chicken like really dark.
so i only put the pep rica on the chicken itself and there you have it right now, going to add the flour to a separate bowl.
and we 're going to add the rest of that season mixture of the other half of the seasoning mixture.
give that a west to get it all combined OK set that aside now in a small bomb going to add an egg an some milk.
all right, then, we 're going to add a few dashes of hot sauce.
i like a little hot sauce and now.
so , yeah, that 's optional and give it a wish to combine westgate whiskey musky.
OK , now it 's time to get started with these different, i have my flower right here.
i got my little egg mixture right here.
and i have a plate to put the chicken on when it has been great.
so , let 's get started going to start by zipping that season chicken in the egg, rolling around.
get it cold in the egg mixture selected accessed, rip-off and then put it right there in the flowers.
and then use your other hand to kind of coat the chicken and that way.
the flower wo n't get so clumpy and then just shake off the excess flour and displace other plate, iraq or ever OK.
now the chick in has been coated with an let 's say for about five minutes, and then i 'm going to dip it back in the flower.
i want to double kofi OK, do n't put it back in the egg mixture just put it back in that flour mixture because you should have some leftover?
and now i 'm going to prepare my, my pan.
i have a baking sheet, i 've covered in foil, then i just placed a little rack on top of it, and i have some vegetable oil here.
is going to make sure that this wreck is thoroughly greece.
because this chick in, you know, it will stick to the rec if it 's not thoroughly greece, alright?
there 's are chickens going to place this on the wreck.
OK , now i have a mixture of butter and olive oil.
i 'm just going to you can brushes on the chick in you can just spoon it over the chicken this just helps it form a nice crunchy crispy crust on it OK, never going to bake for forty minutes i like to draw the last three or four minutes just to get the skin nice and crispy and then when it comes out the oven, let us sit for a bit and then enjoy thanks for watching guys, bye , bye.
