next slide shikara and leave the skin on their little flavoring that 's kinda like mushrooms how, do you slice, and took your two fingers back there and put your middle finger forward, took your nails in and use this part is a guide.
so when your slides you ca n't chop your fingers off, and it 's safe or if you feel uncomfortable choppin or slice in anything like that, just cut it in half.
so it 's all flat again, taking two fingers back middle finger, up tucked in like that 'cause when you 've got your fingers like that, then and use that as a guide.
