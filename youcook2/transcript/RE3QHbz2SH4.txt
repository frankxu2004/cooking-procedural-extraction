just in time for saint patrick 's day i 've got a great recipe that everyone is sure to love it 's irish potato cakes with apple cranberry sauce.
so i 've started by boiling two pounds of potatoes just as if we 're making mashed potatoes.
because i am making mashed potatoes drain the potatoes in a calendar, then add in some butter, and some salt and some chopped garlic and some onions and then mash the potatoes until their chunky smooth OK preheat.
your oven to four hundred degrees.
and then take a spoonful of potato mixture and on a parchment lined baking sheet drop them on there and flatten them out into about half inch rounds and then rush them with melted butter and then bake them in the oven, for about twenty five to thirty minutes until the edges are brown and crispy.
meanwhile , make the apple sauce by cooking cubed apples in some butter, then.
i remove the apples and cranberries to my food processor and.
now add some lemon zest and some lemon juice and a couple of tablespoons of honey and this is hot, very hot product here.
so i 'm going to be careful when i process it going to make some applesauce serve these hot potato cakes with a dollop of that beautiful applesauce.
