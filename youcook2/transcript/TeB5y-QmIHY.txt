the big game is right around the corner and i 've got a bunch of people coming over, but what are they going to eat.
i could order pizza, but i did that last weekend.
people like finger foods.
i have a really good recipe, so let 's get started.
you 're going to need one package of hot dogs make sure that it contains no nitrates because they 're really bad for you.
look up of yellow cornmeal one cup of all purpose flour, a quarter teaspoon of salt or half a teaspoon of kosher salt.
three tablespoons of white sugar four teaspoons of baking powder, one egg, one cup of butter milk, one tablespoon of vegetable oil.
another court of vegetable oil for frying and then some extra all purpose flour for dusting.
if you do n't have buttermilk, you can make your own.
how you do, that is take one cup of milk and add a tablespoon of white vinegar use.
stir it up, and voila, in a pot put in your quart of oil, and then put it on the stove and turn it on medium heat.
now in a large.
bowl , combine your cornmeal flour salt sugar, baking powder and whisk it all together.
then , add your egg buttermilk and oil and whisk it up again.
your batter should look a little thicker than pancake batter.
i want my corn dog pops to be bite size, so i 'm going to cut the hot dogs into quarters.
but you can leave them whole in half.
whatever you want now take your hot dogs and dust them lightly with some of the extra, all purpose flour.
this will help the batter stick to the hot dog pieces.
better then insert a lollipop stick or a skewer into each of the hot dog pieces.
take your hotdog, skewer and then dip and rotate it into the batter, making sure that it 's completely coded then slowly remove it from the better, an let the excess batter drip back into the bowl.
now it 's ready to fry fries with best method for corn dogs.
the liquid batter, and then it develops this crispy outer shell when you cook it to check to see if the oil is hot enough stick a chopstick in the pot and touched the bottom to see if it starts to bubble if it starts to bubble that it 's ready.
now take your better covered hot dog and immerse it into the hot oil while holding the stick be really careful not to burn yourself.
cook it for about two to three minutes or until all the sides are deep.
golden brown, rotate it to make sure it browns evenly now.
take it out of the oil drain on a plate lined with some paper towels the best way to eat.
this is with some classic ketchup and mustard, put it on a platter and served what a great game so fun.
our team won.
everyone ate the food and best of all, it 's quality time with their friends and family.
so the next time you have a big sports get-together trivias, corndogs, everyone will go nuts.
