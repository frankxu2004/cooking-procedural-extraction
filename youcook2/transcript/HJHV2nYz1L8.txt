this recipe for stir fried egg noodles is a favorite among my friends and colleagues and often requested for our get togethers, when cooking for a group.

we also need roast pork.
i shared this video recipe earlier, so, please click the link or see my channel for the recipe.
feel free to use another meat of your choice, such as chicken, beef or seafood for vegetarian options use pan fried seitan or tofu, or we can omit the meat altogether.
we start by removing the fresh egg noodles from the packaging now.
gently unravel an loose in each of the bundles, using kitchen shears, cut the strand so they are shorter.
this will make it easier to cook and eat later.
next bring a large pot of water to a rapid boil drop in the noodles and then swirl around in the hot water for thirty seconds as the noodles are really thin.
we do n't want to overcook them now.
we drain the noodles in a large calendar.
we rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.
toss , the noodles in the calendar and tried to remove as much of the water as possible.
now let 's spread out the noodles on several large platters or trays, and let them air dry for two hours.
it 's important that the noodles are dry before stir frying.
otherwise , they will be soft and mushy for the roast pork or any meat of your choice, we just need to cut into thin strips smash.
the garlic and then remove the skin.
now we can finally mince it for the carrots cut into thin slices.
i 'm cutting at a slight angle and then we cut into thin strips cut the celery stock into two inch sections, and then again, we cut each of the sections into thin strips.
the onion just needs to be cut into thin slices for the bok, choy.
separate the leafy part from the stem cut the stem just like we did the celery into thin strips cut the bok, choy leaves in half and then just give them a rough chop.
the vegetables are prepped and we can continue with the next steps to make the stir fry sauce.
let 's combine two tablespoons of soy sauce.
two tablespoons of oyster sauce and one teaspoon of sugar, just give it a quick stir to mix everything together next.
let 's heat a large wok over medium high heat.
and when it 's nice and hot drizzle in one tablespoon of vegetable oil swirl the walk slightly to evenly coat it with the oil.
now , add the minced garlic and quickly stir fry for ten seconds.
add the carrots and stir fry for one minute, next.
add the celery and again stir fry for one minute at the onions and bok, choy stems and stir fry for one minute.
let 's add the bok, choy leaves now and toss everything together.
stir fry, for about a minute until the leaves are wilted, now, turn off the heat.
add two tablespoons of the stir fry sauce and then mix everything together, finish by adding some freshly ground, black pepper.
now scoop out the veggies in place in a clean bowl.
we will be stir frying these vegetables again so they do n't need to be completely cooked at this time heat.
the same walk over medium high heat and add two tablespoons of oil, add the noodles making sure to spread them out on the surface of the walk.
if you have a smaller walk, you may need to cook in a few batches try not to stir fry too many noodles at once or they make lump together.
stir fry, the noodles for about six to seven minutes, tossing, and then spreading them out in the walk.
so they do n't clump together if the noodle start to stick together drizzle in a little bit more vegetable oil.
now we can add back the vegetables at the roast pork or your choice of meat.
toss everything together combining all the ingredients drizzle in the remaining stir fry sauce.
add some more black pepper stir fry for another two minutes, and then we 're all finished enjoy this as a main entree or a side dish.
