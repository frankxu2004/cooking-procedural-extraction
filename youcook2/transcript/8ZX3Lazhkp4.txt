hello , my name is kevin rainier today.
i 'll show you how to poach eggs.
i have a slotted spoon here.
and i 'm going to probably handle on some dick object to keep it flat on a plate.
let 's crack an egg and do it, and see what 's inside.
obviously , there is the yolk, the interesting part, is that there are two types of white?
there is the white that looks like the serious congestion 's not the kind.
we need sudafed for and there is the way that looks like running loose not the very thin type and the running nose white is the kind that causes problems during poaching the best way to deal with it is to remove it before the egg goes in the path with a few seconds for the thin white to drop off white the underside of the spoon and pull the egg into a small ramekin woke up.
i have a two quart pot with slightly more than two inches of water here, which is the minimum.
we need for poaching.
let 's season it to taste with salt and bring to a boil.
once you get a bull, turn down your part to very low, the water should be barely simmering, take a spoon and stir the water to create a vortex.
it does n't need to be a violent vertex input to revolutions of the spoon per second, as soon as i stop stirring.
i 'll bring my cup with the egg to the very surface of the water and boom.
they at least going to the part in one fast motion or the yolk might lose.
the white, the reason we need the vortex is to wrap the white around the yolk and give the beautiful combat ship.
it also helps the white coagulate faster when a cold egg of forty seven seventy degrees goes into a two hundred degree water, the water immediately around the egg recalls off you make the water move knew hot water is washed over the egg, constantly helping the white coagulate.
it works just like the convection fan in your oven, when the egg just starts to set about thirty seconds after it goes into the pot.
i stir the water gently around it until it let 's go of the bottom.
this one was n't even stack.
but it never hurts to store the part of it note how the water is not bubbling at all right now.
not even the tiniest bubble.
if you use a thermometer to check it, it should stay under two hundred to keep the white tender, we need to keep things just below a simmer.
the total cooking time for an egg varies between three and five minutes depending on how much what do you have in the.
pot , how much what you dreamed off and how well done.
you like you looks.
i like my yolks running, and allergic in a small pot, will get there in about four minutes?
let 's get that one egg out with a spatula where clean slotted spoon and put it on a paper towel to dry.
one more egg, first cover your path to return it to a simmer.
otherwise , the timing will be unpredictable.
the roosters to bubble turn it down and stir with practice.
you could forego, dirtying a ramekin and drop the egg rate from the slotted spoon into the water.
you , i have thirty seconds to go with this egg, but i want to warm up my first tag.
so i 'll return it to the pot here.
we go to beautiful eggs, both at perfect temperature if some feathery pieces of white are bothering you, you can turn them off.
i think i will have lunch number from hells kitchen in boston, happy, cooking, and baking the year.
