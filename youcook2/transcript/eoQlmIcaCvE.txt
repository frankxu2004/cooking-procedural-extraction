i 'm going to show you how to make some naan bread.
this is so delicious and yummy and it is a lot simpler than you think so.
let 's get started.
and i 'll show you how to make it first up into a glass filled with a small amount of warm water going to add in the sugar and the yeast while up to one side into a bowl.
we 're going to sit down our flower in adam assault and the baking powder.
the natural yogurt end, the milk.
once i least mixtures become nice and fluffy.
we 're going to add that in as well, and then give everything a good mix.
now you can start off with a spoon, but eventually you 'll need to get in there with your hands.
you want to mix everything together until it forms a dough then onto a floured surface.
we 're going to need that dough.
now we 're going to need this for about five to six minutes until that dough becomes nice and smooth.
then we 're going to pop out dough into agrees bowl covered up with the teacher, and probably in a warm dry spot for about an hour.
now to prepare the spinach into a pan.
i 'm going to add a little bit of olive oil and a teaspoon of garlic cook for a minute or.
so and then turn down the heat to low.
then i 'm going to add in the spinach drizzle with a small amount of water.
give it a quick mix.
and we 're going to put the lid on an let that spinach, wilt down, then we 're going to drain off any excess liquid and put it to one side to cool once out dough has risen to about twice its size.
we 're going to give it another quick need for a couple of minutes and then we 're gonna chop, it up into three different pieces or two.
if you want to make them bigger and then we 're going to roll them out into an oval shape until there about half a centimeter thick.
but then it 's just a matter of assembling everything together, add on the spinach and the cheese then place the second piece on top and press down the edges for the garlic man simply to spread on a little bit of olive oil and add on the crushed garlic sprinkle with some cracked pepper, and then we 're ready to cook them into a pan on medium heat.
we 're going to add in some butter and then we 're going to cook these on either side for about four to five minutes until they 're nice and golden.
brown do the same with the garlic naan, they were going to pop them into the oven for about seven minutes to finish that cooking process, and then they are done so, whether you stop them with your favorite feeling.
we keep them nice and simple.
these really are delicious.
young know whether you serve that up with your favorite, carry all your favorite condiment.
