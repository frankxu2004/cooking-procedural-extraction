hi , i might lee ann, i love traveling around the world and trying different cuisines from all over the world.
so today i 'm going to tell you about this recipe, which is a pastor for grownups.
yes , it 's the penny.
allow wodka and this is a recipe or this is a dish that i had in a quaint little italian bistro on new york 's upper east side.
so i 'm going to tell you about this pasta dish, which i 'm sure you 're going to love.
let 's see, what we 're going to need for this really yummy pasta dish.
so i 'm going to need about two tablespoons of olive oil.
one tablespoon of butter one teaspoon of red chili, flakes one teaspoon of dry italian, seasoning about two tablespoons of ketchup.
one tablespoon of all purpose flour some salt and pepper, then one cup of marinara sauce.
the recipe for this you will get in my playlist.
two tablespoons of mozzarella about two tablespoons of parmesan cheese, then two cups of penny pastor about one and a half cups of whole milk, and of course splash of vodka, so.
let 's start by heating are saute pan.
your , they make sure that your heat is really low.
because once you start working the milk in the recipe it burns very quickly, so i 'm going to add about two tablespoons of olive oil.
now , the reason why add the other boy forced, and the butter.
next because, if you add the butter force, it 's going to burn.
so it 's going to give that surely burnt effect, which you do n't want.
so now when it heats up slightly i 'm going to add in the butter.
so the butter really gives us really creamy, creamy texture to the pasta, so, that is the reason why we add butter as well.
so just let it melt slightly.
now , what i 'm doing here is i 'm actually mixing the vegetable source, which is the white cheese sauce, and i 'm mixing the marne, our source.
so in caves actually creamy and tangy effect to the pastor all in one shot.
so my butter and olive oil have melted now.
so i am just going to add one tablespoon of all purpose flour in this and at this point just risk it nicely.
so we 're cooking the flower slightly for a minute or two just to remove the rawness and to give with that thick texture in the cheese sauce.
at we want, so this is your classic vegetable or white sauce.
as aids mean, so now i 've made this really nice.
based of the flour and butter and olive oil.
so now i 'm adding about a cup and a half of whole milk in raise.
so just add it and why you 're adding just store in wisc.
so that no lumps are formed.
so just add all that and keep on risking.
so that no lumps or form.
so the whole idea is to think in this source slightly.
so that 's when we add the pasta.
it gets quoted in the bridges, so i 'm just going to let this work in the mean time.
i 'm just going to season it with some salt and pepper.
so now you see that my source has started thickening away.
we 're going to let this work.
so that it gives a nice body to the pasta.
so at this stage i 'm just going to add my mozzarella cheese right into the source.
so it gives actually cheesy flavor to the sauce.
it is give it a quick store.
and you will see that the sources started coming together started thickening beautifully so our sources thinking beautifully.
now i 'm just going to add my marner, asocio, a cup of it, make sure that your heat is low.
take tangie and creamy sauce.
affect i 'm going to give it a quick store again.
so as i 'm talking to you this whole place, is just smelling of fantastic sauce?
so give it a quick store mix.
it , well, just going to add the remaining source.
the reason why din add the whole source first just to see how it looks because we want this really nice pink color to the source.
give it a quick mix.
i am going to slightly season it with maybe a teaspoon of italian, seasoning just to give it more depth of flavor.
a teaspoon of red chili flakes and some ketchup two tablespoons of it and give it a quick store again.
so now is the fun and exciting part.
so now i 'm going to add the much awaited wodka.
so pretty much you can use as much as you want.
i love to give it a couple of splashes about two tablespoons or so, and.
now what we 're going to do is, we 're going to let the alcohol evaporate and let the source boil.
so that you get all the flavors of what kind it.
but without any alcohol.
so it 's absolutely perfect for everybody.
so i 'm just going to bring it up to a boil and then we 'll add our pastor to it.
so now my sources started boiling and the alcohol is all evaporated.
so i 'm just going to simply plop in the pastor right inside the sauce.
so what i 've done your is made it more interesting by mixing some whole wheat pasta and some regular pastor.
just make it more fun and colorful just get all the source in the ridges of the pastor and that 's it pretty much penny.
ala botka is ready to be served so just give it a quick mix so what i 'm going to do is i 'm just going to ladle some on this serving platter.
here , and this is just perfect for those late night date nights.

i 'm going to sprinkle some far mesiano, reggiano cheese, which has to be as pure as you can get.
