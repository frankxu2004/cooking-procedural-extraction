today , i 'm going to show you guys how to make one of my favorite toasties.
now it 's loosely based on the classic french problem.
sure , i think life is a little bit too short to be making venture mile road.
toasting so i 'm going to speed that up a little bit.
we got a bit of creme, fresh some dijon mustard and some lovely cheese and we 're going to use that instead of the best mall.
so the first thing to do is combine these three in a bowl.
a little bit of creme fresh dijon mustard.
we 've got some lovely greer that we 've already grated so good handful of that.
in there just going to mix that to combine, so this is our b√©chamel replacement.
that 's all combine now.
onto the bread be nice and generous.
he want loads of cheese in this during two layers.
one for the bottom, which will put the ham on and then one on the top, which is going to bubble up once you put in the aventador.
chris popovic, gorgeous, so nice and generous.
now this is the primo ham and i 'm really love this stuff, so we used to be super generous with that layered on , OK.
so we 've got the ham on their slave.
this other piece straight on the top like that.
we want this whole melting in golden.
i 'm just going to give a tiny bit of salt now.
bit of butter into a medium pan soon as that starts to bubble up.
i 'm going to pop out sandwich, striding now.
the idea is going to start cooking process here.
it 's going to get nice and brown on the bottom that button is going to give it a lovely flavor.
once it 's brown going to pop that into an oven for about eight minutes, and that 's going to get warm through crispy and crunchy on the top and then i have.
my favorite toasty protects a couple minutes for that.
now this toasty is beautiful, golden on the bottom.
i 've got it in an oven, proof griddle pan, so transfer that to the oven.
it 's on medium, and we 're going to put that in, there for about eight minutes, bring it out.
it 's going to be beautiful and golden going to be ready to rock and roll.
OK , it 's been about eight minutes now.
i 'm going to pull this out of the oven, yeah, that is, gooey and, bubbly and gorgeous a good tip.
and i 've learned this.
the hard ways if you put a tea towel over the handle of that when you go to grab it again, you wo n't burn your hand off.
so keep that in mind, and this toasty is pretty damn good and bring them over, see that cheeses or melting the hamza nicely warmed through it 's going to cut.
that put that on your plate.
and , that is all you need to do they go.
it 's my favorite toasty.
with the primo double smoked leg hand.
