i used the beef ribs for this video.
but you can use a poop ribs or.
so it takes time to marinate the meat.
but otherwise, it is very simple and easy to make soaked when half pounds or beef ribs in water for about two or three hours to get rid of the blood, change the water every one hour when he gets blood like this, two or three hours later wins the ribs and drain the water could one asian pear in half of an onion grind them together in a mixer for the pair and onion mixture into the beef lips mix well and set it outside for an hour.
this will help to get rid of the bad meat flavor and make it sweet and tender in a bowl.
combine all of the ingredients for the sauce mix, well.
until those sugar and honey desserts one hour later pour the sauce mixture on the beef ribs and mix well, cover it with plastic rep and marinade.
