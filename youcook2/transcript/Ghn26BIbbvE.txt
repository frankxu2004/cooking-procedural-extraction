hey guys, discussion monster, today, i 'm going to show you what is said to be one of culture 's favorite food, or at least one of them.
this is incredibly healthy.
it 's simple and you kind of just pushed together things.
you already have miscellaneous vegetables punch on side dishes and proteins whatever kind you want with just some drizzle of voltage on the red pepper paste, and you talked it with a sunnyside egg.
it is it 's very delicious, and filling in, feeds a lot of people and i 'll just show you one away.
i do it.
but you can this your own here 's my lineup ingredients i just want to go over them real quick.
you 'll need eggs to slide on sunnyside up on top of her whole PVM, BAP i have some deeply fermented, kimchi and it 's best to use firmansyah, kimchi.
when you 're cooking with it with this magic butter to help soften it going to cook it, offen some rendered, rendered bacon fat, you know, how much.
i love my bacon.
i 'm trying to sneak it in there all the time, and i 'm going to eyeball this just like me and my momma do.
but precise measurements we found on my block with squishy monster dot com so, i just have a little open container of sesame E oil.
some soy sauce, coupled up seaweed.
if you ca n't find crumbled up.
it 's the same.
you just take a sheet and a scramble.
it yourself in a zip lock bag, i have some meat left over you can use whatever is leftover or what 's on sale, and i 'm going to mix that with the marinade of the approval guy stuff that i made with my mom.
i have a video on that, and it 's also going to be on my blog because i 'm eyeballing things.
i just have a plate of garlic and some green onions and some sesame E seeds.
some shit talking mushrooms.
i have some fern break, then these are found ready to eat already in a package at your asian market, if not, you can just find the dried ones and just rehydrate them.
i have my korean moo korean, radish, and i just put them into little matchsticks like this.
but in a pinch, i guess any kind of radish would do even a turnip.
and then i have some soybean sprouts.
not mung beans soy bean sprouts in some spinach back there that i 'm going to both just kind of plunge into some hot water and shocking some ice cold water, and basically i 'm going to blanch them in details about that.
we found in my blog, it did n't think you would be very fun to share that part.
so it 'll be found on my block and.
let 's get started.
you guys after i blanched both by jeez.
i plunged them in ice cold water just to shock them to retain that vibrant color and to stop the cooking process, and what i 've done to both the soybean sprouts and the spinach.
i 've just squeezed out any access water, you want it to be not sopping wet settings.
i 'm just going to add in a little sprinkle salt pepper and then a drizzle of sesame E oil some garlic, some green onions, lots of sesame E, seeds, and then i 'm going to mix it, you can do this with your hands, or you can use some gloves.
i 'm gonna stand pay method, and just give this a nice talk together with your hands.
and you can taste periodically just to see if it needs any more salts or any more seasoning or anything like that, but this is pretty much done.
i 'm going to do the same thing with my spinach swap poles.
here my signatures right here take off my clothes.
food , awhile drizzle in my system oil sprinkle and lots of garlic green onions sesame E seed and liberally salt and pepper.
this is everything i 'm going to saute.
that 's all that 's really left here.
i 've just had my baking going in this pen when i add my king she and my butters do it.
and it kind of thought hey it just so i bloom the flavors and everything is nice and soft.
so , after this are all these using that same pinan it 'll help flavor everything else, with that smoky bacon spicy kimchi flavor.
i 'm going to glaze the bottom of my pan like then, put in my most bowl and especially of all, it 's going to splatter.
so be careful my radish.
my korean radish, and i 'm going to flavor almost everything.
similarly , going to give it a nice coat in the oil and then service i 'm going to add in salt pepper nicely freshly ground source.
garlic , of course, i feel like garlic is one of those things that makes everything better and then towards the end.
i 'm going to put in my green onions, the twinkle in my system speed now in a little tiny drizzle of stephanie or soy sauce.
just a little tiny bit just give it that extra little depth of flavor.
the color and that 's false device same day, leo here glaze the bottom of my pan with the sesame E oil, and i 'm going to put in my creamy or node.
not communities are much talking mushroom and salt to bring out and draw some of that moisture, out, pepper.
i know this is getting kind of redundant right.
but it 's, it 's supposed to be simple.
because you know, the pension comes up pretty quickly or really ideally, you should just have these laying around in just comprised of leftovers a little drizzle of such mean fuck, shit stock today.
so i thought it 's a little person color and some flavors already put this in sleep well, i 'm losing my mind, saying guys from garland and some green onion for GN is this a knife coding or costco everything together and little rule thumb do n't submerge your mushrooms.
whatever mushroom it may be in water.
it 's going to destroy them.
it 's a fun thing.
it 'll just kind of soak everything up just brush it lightly with a wet paper towel or LEGO watch clock next to last.
are my friend breaks and again going to splatter should be very careful and sure that with japan?
and this is the same stuff that i put in my dick, it down.
the beach brisket hangover soup, kind of break it apart with your spoon or structural.
rather , stimula and drizzle in your soy sauce and remember just be mindful that you do n't add two too much salt to this with everything has been layered with salt since evening.
an , you know, this voice is very faulty just a little tad bit of salts, lots of fresh ground, black pepper lots of garlic more garlic and then towards the very end put in your green onions.
but not before you put in your sesame seeds and since this is already ready to go you just kind of want to heat it through an let the garlic do its thing do it straw by infusing it with that, nice garlicky flavor.
you do n't have to cook this like until it 's mushy.
so just give it a quick toss and let it go for just a couple minutes.
last thing to do is cookoff my proval guy.
and it 's sitting with marinate, optics point for a good thirty minutes or so, and can be hot getting on how well could do you like your meat.
just let it go an all that sunspots are kind of karma lies and make it, delicious i love people do and if you wanna move more not just for the purpose of this, obviously makes, you know, five pounds of this stuff and you can freeze it freezes pretty well here, my plate of goodies i wanted to show you guys before i dug into it my, rice is just about steamed, and i 'm going to ripen egg, and i 'll show you how to make the sauce here is.
my korean radish move my fern break my shit.
talky mushrooms might crumbled up roasted seaweed.
my kimchi, flavored with lots of bacon and butter and then we have our spinach.
are soybean sprouts and approval in my bowl here?
i just have a spoonful of red pepper paste culture down.
and then i 'm going to drizzle in my sesame E oil sprinkle in my assess me seed.
just a little kiss of sugar just to balance out the spike seen it.
spicy bite of this and given a nice mix here is my TV, above.
i think that mom and dad are really going to enjoy this for dinner tonight.
i just laid everything on top to make beautiful colors unhelpful.
my price, and there 's my thoughts in of sunnyside eggs very important to have a sunnyside egg, then mix in with everything in the heat of everything else kind of continue to cook the acura presented to be nice and creamy and rich, i mean, you can make this in.
personalizes to make your own so have fun with it whatever matches are hurting.
