i 'm going to make one of my favorite irish dishes, colcannon.
it is delightful, now an irishman owner.
kangaroo go into a bar well, if you want to know the answer to that or the punchline watch the end, the video.
let 's get on and make cole.
so , first of all, we want to get those potatoes on cooking now, depending on the amount of people you 're serving you need to take your potatoes peel and cut them up.
we put them into a source when he ran we just covered them over with water.
now i 'm adding about a teaspoon or.
so assault just a season, the water, and then we take them over to the stove and bring them up to the boil.
now they need to cook for about fifteen minutes or until the potatoes are nice and tender.
now when you take a knife and you push it into the potato, and it goes through without any resistance, you know your potatoes are ready to mash.
so i bring my source bent over to the sink, and just holding the lid on at an angle, we can just pour out the hot water.
now if you take your meshes straight away and try to match those potatoes.
they 'll be a little bit dry so to make our mashed potato a little smoother.
i 'm just going to add a knob of butter into there and a splash or so of full cream milk and now.
that 's a lot easier to match up to a smooth mashed potato.
so now i 'm is ready.
we 're just set that aside and get on and prepare the colcannon now.
traditionally , cabbage or kale is used, but i really think cal is the best and i 've got my cal here.
we just want to pull the leaves off the side.
we do n't want the stalks because they 're a little bit tough now.
i want is off the stalks we 're just going to take a knife and roughly chop.
it does n't have to be too accurate.
we 're just going to break it into smaller pieces.
then we can lift those and put them into a large saucepan and now i 'm going to put water into this pot probably only about an inch.
and we 're going to bring that up to the boil and then simmer it for about five minutes, that should allow the cal to wilt down and, just one last little point whilst that comes up to the boil.
i 'm just going to season that with a little bit of salts.
so once arcalis on to boil i 'm just going to take three onions here.
i 'll just cut the tops off and then we 're going to find these slice these up.
so we have three spring onions.
their finely diced, and i 've got a small source been here, and i 've got half a cup of full thick cream.
we 're just going to take those spring onions now and put them in the cream and then we 're going to take that over to the stove.
and we just bring that up to a simmer.
so when that cream has come up to a boil i 'm just going to turn it off and let the onions continue to cook a little bit, if you come over here, you can see my cal whoops is that too much steam michail is completely wilted down and that.
now is ready to use the potatoes.
of course are all mesh tan on the side now, strain the cal from the big source.
banana , i 'm bringing my creamy mashed potato over and bring it into that pan.
i 'm going to add another decent sized knob of butter into there and then in goes my cream, which is.
now infused with the flavor of those spring onions and.
now that cal that we drained all the water out of that goes in and then, we 're going to thoroughly mix this together , now.
i 've seen people use blenders with this, but i really think it makes it to fine.
it 's meant to have lots of texture in it and i want to season this with a good twist of black pepper that really is just to taste now.
there is my beautiful call.
cannon is getting ready to serve, but what about the kangaroo.
what i 've got here some lovely kangaroo, bangers or kangaroos snags as we call them.
i 'm just going to cook those up whether punch line of the story at the end was the irishman came out with a taste.
peru and why not because they are delicious, i 've got some kangaroos snags here i 'm just going to cut them up into small slices now.
i 've got my colcannon here in a bowl, and i 'm just going to do the traditional thing, which is to make a little divot in the top in a little melt, and i 'm taking my little roof snags.
and i 'm just dropping them around the outside.
now colcannon itself is a wonderful dish, an with a little bit of sausage in there it just adds, a meatiness that i absolutely love and i can tell you i ca n't wait to get stuck into this it looks delicious, the colors are fantastic give this call cannon, a try no wonder, this is one of the most popular irish dishes it is fantastic it is delicious i hope you do n't mind me bird in the sausage in with it was a bit of fun and irish friend of mine, suggested it.
