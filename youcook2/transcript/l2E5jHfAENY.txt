hi , welcome back to cooking with grace.
today , we are ending the kitchen of seasonal.
when he shot an owner chef eddie and he 's going to teach us how to make leadership.
so eddie can you tell us more about this dish, the video skips, oh, is one of the most traditional dishes in australia?
it 's basically as in cooking to prepare to take a slightly tender.
fifteen minutes, in order to execute it takes a new shorter.
it 's a very thankful for giving me all and everybody looks like the kids love it.
i guess everybody was fighting these days.
course , fresh deals off ramp this from this is from farm hill, new jersey.
beautiful meat cleans it color.
it 's like no of colorization know, nothing.
super thing, all purpose flour whole egg and bread crumbs, bread crumbs are plain breadcrumbs.
no seasoning no herbs, no number start with politicians.
put it down.
and then i, i show you what the next thing you do have a very fancy power here your model, model of tristate buddy we take.
the finest do any here.
we can always try to keep one level between chopping board and power equipment like this is this or that they had holds the winner and you 'll be able to play it, it 's gonna be very difficult.
so should be like two eighth of an inch.
thick , i 'm sorry about the noise, and we found among besides and that money makes them.
it also very tender and most importantly it cooks more evenly.
which you want as well, so mine is ready.
you got a smaller surface easier over let level, level right now.
i 'm going to show you one.
i 'm going to do the other one.
very simple flower, shake up all the axis powers, you do n't want too much you put in PA to shake his hand.
OK , when you take it out this about tell my share, you always want to work with clean hands.
we just use two fingers OK and not you do n't.
you do n't like siri for entire hand in there.
those , people should work.
send terry, we should work clean OK here 's a dinner, and you then, you covered with reference biggest.
only a slight touch on top shake off the flower also in the bread crumbs perfect will be sure, sure, so what kind of oil do you use traditionally.
we would use butter.
but i have to say this is not a very modern way to cook this people, i think are very, very health conscious, these days.
so i think butterfat is a bit too heavy.
we use canola oil and what the traditional way would be.
and , you know, what lots of people are actually like hurt themselves regularly.
but i 'm using to like oil, a slash pool for an open vernors.
so , i think as you can see on, i see that stuff, and then how that how hot is it well, three sixty five heights.
and traditionally the color of the dinner would be the same power like this credit values and crash the instrument.
so just cause perfectly then you click it just like the other one as well perfect to play alright.

the preparation time up.
this is like it 's not even like sixty seconds.
yeah , so how do you do this to me, this with everything i buy sell a piece of a small piece of potato.
