OK , a new recipe and new football jersey.
penne vodka shots up tomato and cream sauce, with vodka reduction, which is a fairly popular dish and italy and on the menu of american italian restaurants, one of my favorite dishes.
first time i made it was just the other day, and i 'm going to attempt to duplicate that 'cause it turned out really well.
it 's very easy dish.
as you 'll soon see it 's very simple.
one or two three one two or three steps, and like that OK for the ingredients, you will need a couple of cups of tomato, sauce is my homemade tomato sauce that just like the exactly like them, recipe, i have on my channel, here somewhere if you do n't have, tomato sauce in your repertoire of dishes to cook you need to work on that some penne pasta fancett, a are we as we say in spain time.
i have a little bit of come on, spanish her parmesan cheese and cream vodka is the name, applies.
i 've already started some water to boil for the pasta, and a little something for me, you know, for the effort, some nice olives that i 've got picked up from my halal butcher shop, i just found out their tremendous olives there.
they had a glass of why from hootie, eldrick ada, here in the valencia community water on boil aggressively salted as mario batali says, did you put a couple of drops of olive oil in there, too just because, just, because, just.
because i put olive oil and everything i eat now.
get the water hot.
so i pass to be quick to cook heating.
the pan up for cooking the pasta dish.
and i like my big, you can use a skillet.
but i really like this big deep pan.
because at the end i 'm going to be mixing the pasta in with it and then right.
so heating up some olive oil.
stupid available is going to get quite a bit of fat for me.
the and chatter that i 've kind of cut up rather, rather, well this, so it 's nice manageable pieces.
so this into the pot cook this down the spanish ham is pretty well cooked.
so , at just needs to go into the end randomness.
nice fatty, pancetta down.
this was the reason we 're using.
this is because of the nice fat content, you can also cook this dish with shrimp or seafood or on this about anything else.
but if you could use you can use the product.
why would this year i just do n't understand bitch?
so the chatter is rendered down through, well, allows the ham said, it does n't really need to customers that again and.
now comes the tricky part and i had the vodka said by the cup to care for this may flame up.
so if i may have destroyed the camera cost with the fire department, then i wanna do is in glaze the pan with this turn up the heat.
now that will flame the vodka.
i do n't really think that 's necessary because this the heat will does the same thing as flaming avacha so i 've added the tomato sauce.
let that up the temperature.
next step will be to add some heavy cream.
not quite right, yet pascoes come on.
i see you want to cook this, a little less than usual.
if you go for alabama, a little less than al dente.
because you 're going to cook it in the sauce for awhile and that will cook the process, we do n't want to get pushy as you may have noticed.
i have n't had any have n't added any seasoning to this you could add a little bit of red pepper.
but i 've put any salt in because the ham has salt sand.
there 's a little bit of solvent.
my tomato sauce, but as i just gave a little taste as it does n't need anything it 's actually very good.
just as it is, this is now i 'll just add to this.
i 'm going to add some piece just for a little bit of color.
i am just getting a little more a little more body.
i guess texture and color add nutrients to.
now the cheese you can either add with the sauce or just on each individual dish, which is what i prefer to do i do n't like adding it to the sauce.
people do n't like it.
they can, you do n't have to put cheese on it.
and i gotta keep it on the pasta gray nap and throw that in, with the costs are the sausage set mix tape pasta with the sauce.
i used half a kilo of penne so it 's a big fat because i made it the other day.
i knew just about how much sauce.
i wanted very italian sauce ratio, not, not too much sauce lot of people drown their pasta and sausage or the italian way is just discover it and just let this heat up a little bit.
it actually probably turn this off pretty soon, played it up and add cheese and ready to serve.
and i 've, i 've played it up the dish with a bit of fresh parmesan cheese, grated on top.
and , that is penne, alla vodka.
