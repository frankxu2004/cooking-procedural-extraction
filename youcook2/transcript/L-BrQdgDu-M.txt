i am coco and today, we will be preparing the touche salad.
the douche is a lebanese salad made with fresh ingredients, fresh vegetables, and it is seasoned with a spice that adds to the tanginess of this lovely salad, it is made with romaine lettuce tomatoes, radishes, parsley leaves mint leaves cucumbers the green onions, and toasted pita bread, made with tossed in a vinaigrette addressing garlic lemon juice and olive oil, and seasoned with soma, which is a spice that grows in the middle east region that can be found in your local grocery store or at the international food stores near you today.
i had purchased everything that we have here from a local farm and this recipe is makes the great compliment to poultry steak or fish, you could have it as a meal by itself by adding a chicken breast or salmon off the grill, or even stick to it, or if you prefer it 's simply as a vegetarian dish, you could gosh it with a little bit of feta cheese prepared everything here.
it 's all ready to incorporate together.
the romaine lettuce is torn in bite size pieces.
we will add one tomato here, that is diced, radishes.
this is three or four radishes.
these are three green onions that are diced, one cucumber peeled and dust as well.
i prefer to keep the mint leaves whole.
but she may use kitchen scissors and snipped them.
they tend to add a little bit of food style to it when it 's plated, and the per flat leaf parsley as well, you may prefer to cut it with scissors.
make it look prettier once we have all the ingredients here in a bowl.
we will add the vinegar ette.
the traditional recipe calls for the grant to be fried.
but you can also to sit in the oven, with a brushing of olive oil and some salt to add a little more taste to it.
you can add as much as one loaf that 's toasted two loaves, depending on your tastes to choose your hands to incorporate all the ingredients together here and then here we have the two tablespoons of soma, then already pre measured.
you could add bath to the fattoush.
this is an excellent wonderful tasting, spice not only does it add a citrus flavor to it.
but it is beautiful pleasing to the eye, as well , came.
this is one of my favorite salads.
it is very satisfying.
it is refreshing and i prefer to have it as a meal on its own without any vegetables or other vegetables or meet.
