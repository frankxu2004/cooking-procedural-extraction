were adam and joanne from inspired taste out and then and welcome to our kitchen?
today , we 're showing you how to make extra smooth hummus.
it 's really easy.
you 're going to start with tahini, which is a creamy sesame E paste.
give it a stir, an measure out about a quarter of a cup and add it to a food processor or blender next you 'll need some lemon juice.
we like to use about a quarter of a cup.
but you could use a little less or a little more, depending on your taste.
add the lemon juice to the teeny uses strainer to make sure no seeds get through now process for about one minute.
tahini and lemon juice cream together.
become , thick, whipped and creamy.
that 's the secret to creamy ominous.
all right now for some flavor we like to use about half a clove of garlic.
but we peel and mince it really fine.
first that way we help out the processor, and no one is ever going to bite into a big piece of garlic.
next two tablespoons of olive oil that half of a teaspoon of ground cumin and some salt start with half a teaspoon and then taste later, an ad, as you need it just scrape the bottom of the bowl and process again after about a minute, open up the lid scrape again and continue to process this, all helps to make extra smooth, creamy, hummus.
now for the chick peas.
we use one can, but we drain and rinse it first.
add about half of the chick peas to the food processor and process for another minute scrape, then at the remaining chick peas.
now process for once two minutes until extra smooth.
go ahead and scrape the bowl again and.
now to make things really, really smooth, and just like the hummus you buy at the store we like to add two to three tablespoons of water.
this just thins it out a little bit.
you can add as mature as little as you want, as you add the water, you can literally see it get smoother and smoother.
OK , you 're done.
give it a test.
add it to a plate and then top with olive oil or paprika and enjoy.
