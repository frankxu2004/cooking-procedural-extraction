i love potatoes, especially mashed potatoes and when saint patrick 's day rolls around i think mashed potatoes and cabbage their great together, and i 'm going to show you how easy it is to prepare red potato colcannon.
so first of all, i 've already started to saute about half cup of sliced onions, and i slice them.
thin , and once they 're nice and translucent i 'm going to add some really thinly sliced cabbage.
i have about six cups of cabbage.
i just slice it really thin with my chef knife.
i cut the cabbage in half.
it took about half of a medium sized cabbage, and i cut it in half first and then i cut it in quarters took the core out, and sliced two of those quarters.
nice and thin for this dish, and.
now i 'm just going to cite a it in the pot with the onions until it starts to get a little bit brown.
so it will take a few minutes.
so it took about five minutes from the cabbage to get a little bit brown.
now , i 'm going to add half cup to one cup of milk, you can use dairy or nondairy milk for this, and once i add the milk.
i 'm just going to cover the pot just for a couple minutes, so that the cabbage just cooks a little bit more there.
we go now while that was cooking.
i steamed my potatoes.
i have one pound of small potatoes.
i did n't peel them there.
redskin potatoes, and i cut them into quarters, and i steam them until they are just tender.
so i can poke my fork in nice and easy.
but they 're not going to smush up.
that 's exactly how they like them.
and i 'm going to take my tender, steamed potatoes, add them to the pot and then all i 'm going to do is mash it up a little bit.
you can use your hand potato masher.
or you can use a big fork and just mash up the potatoes now.
this is not smooth, creamy mashed potatoes.
this is a lot more rustic.
so you 'll have just nice pieces of potato with the redskin showing the browned cabbage.
it 's delicious and it goes perfect with your corn beef.
if that 's what you 'd like to have for saint patrick 's day there that looks perfect.
now i 'm just going to stir it up.
add a little bit of salt and pepper give a little taste.
now you 're all set for saint patrick 's day.
i 'm suden sharing good food for good life, three sixty five.
