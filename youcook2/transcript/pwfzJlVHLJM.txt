hi , i 'm chef amy hoagie.
i 'm here to teach you how to play with food, or i take a classic recipe change it, up a little bit to create a whole new dish.
so today i 'm playing with macaroni salad, and here i 'm just making a simple homemade macaroni salad nothing too crazy, i 've got some cooked macaroni.
you can use any kind of positive you want obviously.
but you can go ahead and cook it, al dente, six to seven minutes, keeps its shape really nice, not too soft.
so put in the fridge.
you 're good to go got a half of a hard boiled egg got a little bit onion.
you can use any kind of onion.
you want i got some green onion.
here i 'm going to take a little bit of carrot when i hit it with some salt and then i 've got some dressing a simple dressing.
just mix up a little mayo a little vinegar, and a little bit of sugar.
you do n't have that you could always throw in a little ranch, ranch goes with everything and then just toss it around, it 's pretty simple.
it 's kind of a nice light dish when you 're really hungry.
but you do n't want to spend too much time in the kitchen as long as you have some of these.
it 's really good to have some of these things chopped up ahead of time.
anyway , here you go easy.
macaroni salad thanks for joining me.
