today at dude food we 're making our take on a BLT with east coast swordfish and basil mayonnaise.
so we got this really beautiful east coast swordfish, you really want to shop for whatever is the best.
it 's swordfish is nice.
you get that if tunas lines to get that it 's all about what is the best and that 's going to make the best sandwich.
you really want to look for a fish that has a little more fat content 'cause that 's going to kind of compete with bacon.
we 're going to put in this, so we 're going to start off by cooking the bacon.
turn it on medium heat, and you want to make sure when you 're using a cast iron pan.
you kind of put little bit of olive oil in there, get an icing glistening and even when you 're done.
washing you never want to wash it in the sink.
you always want to pull it off a little bit of olive oil in the pan or grapeseed , oil.
something to keep a voice is so it does n't rust and the beauty of these pans is there 's no like real hot spot.
you get a crank in the beginning, turn it down, and then it 's going to hold this heat really well, probably going to take about three to four minutes to cook after about a minute and a half, two minutes on each side.
because we want to show how to slice up the future little bit we have a piece of swordfish with the skin on it, you just want to remove that 'cause that 's not available.
we want to get a nice thin piece flapping on the, on the pan and cook it within ten seconds per side, rest your hand on top of the fish, try not to cut the top your hand off and then just go through kind of right hand season.
both sides salt and pepper, i 'm gonna put the bacon out.
you can see it can get a little bit of color around it.
but it 's not that crispy baked in houston when you pull it, pull it out of the oven, if you want to be kind of saw fit on the sandwich.
let 's get the fish on again.
you want to ripping hot pan.
so use like a grape seed oil or canola oil for this, you can see a little bit of smoke coming out through the side.
that 's when he wanted to take it off the heat a little bit.
and you want to cook this fish, you want to look at seventy five percent on one side when you flip it your basic just touching the heat to it and cooking it through.
so , let 's go again.
i 'm going to show you how to toast the bread.
normally , we put a little bit of butter on it.
but since we have this great cast iron pan with all this bacon fat in it go to waste.
we 're going to throw a couple pieces just regular white pullman loaf.
if you like wonder, bread, years wonder bread.
this , you want to turn the pain down a little bit lower than what you had to break in the fish 's son to get a white around the edges got that nice char.
you 're controlling the heat.
there 's no front spots.
golden brown going to get under there with that spatula get all that brown bit off.
give it a flip, basic basically by the time you flip the one to push the other going back and get another one out again.
it 's cooked through, but it 's not it 's not going to be dry or overcook, so the last part of this dish is the basil mayonnaise.
we 're going to get a pot of boiling water and we 're going to get the pay is we 're going to blanch it very quickly in salted water about thirty seconds and then shock it in an ice bath.
and you 're going to squeeze it like jeff just did.
you guys squeeze all that liquid out of the shocking, shocking maze getting ice water ice cubes, and then you want, you want to basically reduce the cooking temperature of a very rapidly, and that 's going to retain that green color alright.
OK , we 're going to add the eggs in here three egg yolks and some lemon juice, well, that 's funny, you might have to add a little crunch of water olive oil little bit at a time, i 'm.
so you want to make sure you had a little bit of salt and pepper in there.
you always want to make sure you season everything alright.
so now i 'm going to put together the sandwich slathered some of the basil mayonnaise on top bradley needing a piece of swordfish are throwing top of that.
do you want to each point to have part of the swordfish, you know, you do n't want one bite, just have bacon and tomato, and i have swordfish for a couple of pieces of bacon on little bit of bid lettuce, i mean, if you do n't have bib lettuce, you can use iceberg?
you can use remain whatever kind of whatever kind of salad green you want to put on their works fine.
so just a couple tomatoes on top little more basil mayonnaise on top right or cut that we can turn that beautiful look at that bacon swordfish.
