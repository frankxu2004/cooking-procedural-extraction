hey guys, and welcome to my eat clean series with scav today, i 'm going to be making a very delicious shepherds pie with celeriac mash, said, this shepherds pie has a slight twist seeing as we 're using SL, aariak, as the mash instead of potato.
but the base is quite similar.
so we 're going to start off.
we 're going to fry off some onions so just put in some coconut oil, and will melt that down.
so we 'll fridays off to five minutes until the nice should 've runs color and OK.
next we 're going to add enough garlic and in goes the grated carrot and then we 're just going to move this to the side, and we 're just going to bronze the means.
runs up, say it long, so this is such a beautiful family dish.
i feel like it 's something.
you just want to enjoy sort of crazy at home with the whole family and will put all the details in the full description on the website.
so you can see that we 've pretty much bronze than me, and all the pinky bits are going.
so we can just start that all together.
now i 've got some dried.
and i 'm going to add in some fresh chicken stock and always go for fresh.
get that in.
goes tomorrow period and a nice picture, good quality salt stat altogether this is pretty much our base done.
so we 're just going to leave this to simmer and cook through for fifteen minutes, while we make this larry at match.
so i 've just chopped up into setif little inch cubes roughly and we 've got some boiling water in her.
i 'm just going to boil it up until it 's cooked through.
and also it 's getting a bit more veggie goodness into, but you could use also cauliflower works really, well, thanks, very it 's a really good root veg.
it still got that sort of thick taste, and no one 's going to tell the difference so you do n't have to tell me on that.
it 's there, so we 're going to kick this through ingredients and then chuck it in the food processor and blend until it 's smooth, the salaria X.
nice and quick through.
so you just want to feel like your fork can smoothly go through of drained off all the liquid, and then were pouring this into the food processor.
if you do n't have a food processor, you could also use a hand blender in, goes one edge, inc.
teaspoon of mustard coconut oil and a nice pinch of salt as well, and they will blend this till smooth half.
it 's like that who would know that their celeriac in there, but smells delicious first of all, we got a little in our beautiful minutes.
just been kicking away and all those flavors are really coming together now.
and then we 'll put the match on top.
and they really do love seeing or recreation and a big shout out to pull lush seven.
i heard him say your name right for sending in your awesome recreation of my fish pie.
i hope you enjoyed it.
and i 'm sure you 're going to like this one, too OK.
so the matches on and then we 're just going to do a little chris koster 's on top, which will give a nice crispy mash when it goes in.
so we 've got the oven preheated to two hundred, and we 're just going to work within so here is my nicely cooked salariat, shepherds pie.
