today , we 're going to be making creamy, cheesy mac and cheese.
you 're watching the beneficiary, these are the ingredients that we 're going to need to make the mac and cheese this is a sixteen ounce pack of elbow macaroni.
the small ones.
but we only going to use half the pack for this recipe, OK, this is two and a half tablespoons of all purpose flour.
eight ounces of processed cheese that brand happens to be velveeta.
but you could use any brand.
you , like this is a quarter cup of butter in three cups of whole milk, but you could use two percent.
one percent or nonfat this macaroni and cheese is going to be cooked on the stove top and in the oven.
so let 's move over to the stove where already have the water, boiling for us to add the noodles.
so it took about ten eleven minutes to bring this water to a boil, and it 's my big part that i 'm using here, and i put half of it with water.
and it brought it to a boil if you wanted to come to a boil more quickly.
you should add some salt to the water, i know that.
because we did that in a science project one thing when the kids were little, i did n't add any salt 'cause, you know, the chief has salt.
and we 're going to add some salt to the cheese sauce.
so i did n't add any salt to this water, and i 'm just going to measure what half of his pack of the elbow macaroni.
and we 're going to stand here and watch this.
because we only want this to cook for about five to six minutes.
because we wanted to be aldente, while that 's cooking though i 'm going to move to the left hand side of the store.
and we 're going to get the cheese sauce, started so i have a smaller pot over here.
and i put the fire on just now on high, and i 'm going to take my quarter cup of butter.
put it in the pot so that it can melt and i 'll tell you at what point if we have to put the fire on medium.
so we 're just going to allow this to melt in here so they did n't even take a minute.
we want to just kind of add the flour to it, you gonna make this around, and yes this is a roof that fires too high.
so i 'm gonna turn into media mine.
we do n't want this to get lumpy.
so we just going to work this in there.
because right now we 're going to go ahead add the milk after this is worked in really, well, we 're going to add the milk and remember.
that 's three cups of milk, get the measurement precise on this one OK because is going to need to cook in the oven for awhile.
and we want this to come out the right texture.
so we just added the milk.
i 'm going to let this coke for about two minutes, at which point i 'm going to add the cheese and then i 'm gonna tell you how much longer.
it has to cook OK in the meanwhile.
it 's been about three minutes since i started the noodles over there see the real avoiding, and after i put 'em in, you know, kind of use my spaghetti server thing here.
i use that to just kind of move the noodles around in the pot 'cause i do n't want a clump together.
and when i first start cooking noodles was the one that kind of mastered me i really could n't do noodles.
they were always sticky, and on cooked and too soft or too hard or just could n't get it right so.
and i still do n't think i 'm a master at it.
but i surely know how to time it.
so this is about three minutes of this been cooking.
and like i said, we do n't want to go too long.
'cause it 's going to bake for a half hour in the oven, OK.
so it 's going to be doing some more cooking.
so , let 's move back over here, too.
my cheese sauce in the fires too low now, so i 'm gonna move it back from medium to high, i just kind of turn it down.
just no one did n't want to root a burn.
and then we 're going to add the cheese in a little bit so let me give it a couple more minutes alright it took about three minutes for our milk mixture here to start boiling so now what we want to do is add the cheese in an.
you could put it in that big block, so let me turn this down back to meet him 'cause we do n't want the chiefs escort.
but in the meanwhile i want to move.
back over to the noodle pot.
to show you that the noodles are pretty much done so i just want to show you that these noodles are done when i picked it up like that and i kind of pinch in my finger there not too.
soft , but they 're not hard either like uncooked, so it took about ten minutes.
actually , after the water was bonnie and i put it in it took about ten minutes to get it up when i want to stop it right away.
because i do n't want to overcook.
and i 'm going to take it over the sink and pour it in a colander, right.
so , no science to this right.
it was pouring it in there, and people usually say you want to pour some cold water on that to make it stop cooking and all that stuff.
we do n't need to do all of that for this mac and cheese because basically we 're just finishing up the cheese sauce.
and we 're going to add this to our baking pan.
so just leave it there in a sink for a minute, warn people in your house so they do n't go through their dirty plates in there.
i was up to warn somebody, hey, i 've got something in the sink.
this move back over to the store when check on our cheese sauce, so here 's the cheese sauce you kind of want to keep this on low side.
it does n't get lumps are in does n't burn OK, but it looks like our cheese has melted pretty much in this.
so i 'm going to go ahead and shut this off.
this took a total of about seven minutes to cook like this.
so now let 's move this over to the counter so we can add it to the macaroni.
and to the baking dish, choking so i have this nine by thirteen by two pen and all i 'm doing is pudding are cooked elbow.
and there i did n't butter the dish or anything.
it 's not going to stick to this is one of those non.
so just going to spread it out, and then we want to get our cheese sauce while everything is still warm, and we 're going to go ahead and pour the cheese sauce over this, and then we 're going to get it to the oven OK, and i 've already preheated oven on three hundred fifty degrees.
we 're going to make this for only a half hour.
i 'm sure i get everything.
i want to get anything if it 's burned on the bottom when you put that away just kind of mix it around, well, i 'm not going to put any kind of bread crumbs on the top 'cause.
i 've tried it like that we do n't like it.
that 's my oven.
telling me it 's ready OK.
we do n't like it like that.
so i 'm just going to go ahead and bake it this way, and it 's going to form a little crust over it.
that 's going to be awesome enough without the bread.
crumbs need backup offer that so you can see the dish so there.
we go half hour in the oven, when i come back.
i 'm going to be showing you the finished product and here 's our finished product.
the mac and cheese it took a half hour in oven, and it 's a nice coating on the top right there.
i 'm waiting for it to cool down for a little bit.
then i 'm going to cut out the first license.
huh , well, of course, you know, that mac and cheese is not believing right.
but that 's why i did n't mean to show the police show or the caribbean.
