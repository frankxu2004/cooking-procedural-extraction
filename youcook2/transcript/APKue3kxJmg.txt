it 's a traditional recipe that was invented in naples, which is a beautiful city, you definitely need to go and check it out if you ever come to italy anything pizza.
i 'm going to show you the most traditional of the mall, which is the basic one margarita, which is just a plain red pizza with some mozzarella cheese, and then you can just jazz it up according to whatever you like.
just put it on top of it, it will be and it 's all about the ingredients.
good , fresh drop ingredients trick for an italian plates to be honest, and i think i just rambled and raised for, i do n't know, like thirty minutes or something.
so let 's stop the chatting and.
let 's go straight into the recipe.
you gonna need some all purpose flour natural rising yeast for bread and pizza, granulated white sugar because this wo n't activate your water.
which has to be at least at room temperature.
just a bunch of salt and good quality extra virgin.
olive oil for the dressing you.
gonna need good quality tomato sauce.
i made a video explaining you all about how to do it, and you 're going to need some fresh basil.
some dried oregano and some good quality mozzarella cheese and some extra virgin.
this thing we want to do is activate your east.
so i 'm taking my east.
my room temperature water and my sugar.
i 'm just gonna add my water to the sugar because the sugar activates the east.
it 's basically the food of the east, then you do the water and the sugar you going to add your yeast just gently stir it.
so that any lumps are disintegrated and set it aside for five to six minutes, you 'll see that the east has been activated.
because it will start to four months.
nice bubbly form until my E says activated is nice and falling on top.
take my flowers were going to just make a well at the center.
and i 'm gonna pour in my east water mixture.
then i 'm going to gently incorporated with a fork to the flour mixture sprinkle.
it , uh, about a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil i 'm going to sprinkle in a pinch of salt.
i 'm just gonna lightly.
flour my hands do n't add too much flour because otherwise it will become too sick.
just enough, so that nothing sticks do your hands you, gonna need this thing together, and.
so it 's nice and fluffy, and it does n't stick to your hands any longer.
i 'm going to move the goal to my counter.
be and i 'm going to start reading it.
together the thing is that with red mixtures, the more, the more you need things together the more soft and fluffy, the end result will come out as you can see my pics, adore is nice and ready.
now you just wanna move it into a bowl, and it 's super easy going to take the side, pitch them together.
which them together one lap very flexible.
now you can take your pizza.
bogo and put into a slightly oil both and adding here in the oil.
then i 'll just sprinkle everything around put in my pizza.
go because oil blocks the observation.
so the know crossword before the top of it, and then a cover it with kitchen towel and place this in a warm place to write for about one hour or until it has doubled in size i 'm going to show you the results.
when we get there like pizza dough has been resting for the last hour and a half and it has doubled in size, and it 's nice and fluffy.
it looks perfect and now ready to send it out and shape it into a circular shape.
but the toppings on and eat everything up i 'm going to cover my dough in flower.
so that it 's not sticky and.
now to shape it, it 's really, really easy.
you just with your finger, you went in lent, you do a circular shape in with your fingers, each you start shaping your outside part of the pizza and then when i like to do is with one hand i just start flipping it up on the side, keeping one hand and you can see it just stretches, if you do n't like to do this by hand, you can just roll it out you want to just roll it out evenly not too thinly until it has approximately after conference of thirty centimeters, and you 're done now, you, wanna, cut out your mozzarella i like to cut mine in thin slices just limit a minute to pour out the water and squeeze the water out otherwise, when you put it in the oven, and will become toward ferry.
now you want to take your play, your source and just season it i just like a pinch of salt and adding some oregano.
because to me, tomato sauce and regular is just pizza to breathe you 're just going to take a spoon of your tomato sauce place it in the middle of your pizza and just put it ground i 'm going to top my pizza with mozzarella can you go a couple of leaves of fresh basil, a drizzle of good extra virgin, olive oil.
and now this, you need to put on your baking sheet.
if you have the traditional oven like i do, i just use a nice reheated pizza stone.
and it works perfectly.
if you do n't have a pizza stone just use aluminium foil, not the shining pour it the other way around.
just put up drizzle a bit of extra virgin level.
so then nothing sticks you going to add your pizza.
do it and pop it into a preheated two hundred and fifty degrees?
celsius , oven for at least twelve to fifteen minutes until it gets a nice brown delicious color.
and i 'm going to show you when i get there.
and he, you have it, you are delicious.

i cut myself as nice as i do n't know about you guys.
but we in italy we did with our hands pizza for me.

ever it 's just delicious, as you can see my pizza is quite thin.
but has a thicker cross on the outside beautiful golden color, and this is what we call napoletana style.
