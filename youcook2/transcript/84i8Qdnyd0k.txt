when you 're making mashed potatoes if you 're using the wrong potato and you 're throwing him in a food processor you 're doing it all wrong, the first mistake people tend to make is they picked the wrong potato.
they get waxy or boiling potatoes, which are great for boilings.
but they 're not.
so great for mashing and even if they do by the right potato a lot of people end up not cooking him long enough they cook their potato only until it 's just done the way you would have potatoes with your steak, for instance.
but that makes them harder to mash.
and you end up with little pebbly pieces in your mashed potatoes, and who wants that another problem people have is that they skimp on the milk and cream.
it would end up all stiff.
this is bad.
you might think that using a food processor to mash your potatoes would be great because it 's really quick.
this is so wrong.
it just turns them into this sort of sticky pasty lump of glue.
it is the worst thing you can do to a potato now.
i 'm going to show you the right way to mash potatoes.
the same way my mother showed me the first thing you want to do is pick the starchy potato because it 'll fall apart.
and that 's what you want the star cheese potatoes are russets.
and the next archie esther, uconn goals, and both are just fine.
next you want to peel, rinse, and most important cut your potatoes into nice even chunks that way, they 'll all cook at the same rate and you wo n't get anywhere little nasty hard bits in your potato comes a crucial step you want to cook these potatoes until they are balling apart and put them in cold water and bring them to a boil.
because that starts to break them down more than if you just put them in boiling water, you want to solve the water.
because the salt starts to disintegrate the potatoes too.
but the most important thing is that you really cook those potatoes about twenty five minutes after you bring to a boil let them simmer along and slow until the edges start to fall off and when you stick a knife in the middle, it just all falls apart the potatoes and then put them right back into that hot pot and start to dry them out over very low heat until they really start falling apart.
turning white on the edges and practically turning into mashed potatoes, right.
then and there in the pot to finish the job you can use a hand masher.
or you can use a reiser for super smooth silky potatoes.
so now it 's time to finally add your cream or milk you want to make sure it 's warm, so it does n't cool down your potatoes.
and the most important thing is you want to make sure you use lots do n't worry.
it can look like soup at first.
but if you keep stirring you 'll see those potatoes just drink up all that cream the final step for making great mashed potatoes is to add few fresh herbs, chives, or nice or maybe parsley and some butter if you 've done all of these things right.
you 're going to have fluffy creamy, silky, smooth mashed potatoes that will make you so glad.
you made them.
and everybody at your table will feel the exact same way.
