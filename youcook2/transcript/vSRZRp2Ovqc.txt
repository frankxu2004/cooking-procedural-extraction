hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with spaghetti carbonara, which is, i think it 's going to be a lot different than you imagine first of all, there 's no cream in it.
i think that 's a later day invention, but really this could be called spaghetti with bacon and egg sauce 'cause that 's basically what it is.
so i 'm going to slowly cook some bacon in a little bit of olive oil on medium low heat, traditionally, which uses somebody called when chalet, which is a cured pork cheek bacon type product, or you can use pancetta smoked i actually prefer the unsmoked flavor of the pan shadow.
so if you can find pancetta or guanciale E use that right.
so we 're going to cook that until not quite crisp.
we want it cooked but not browned and crispy.
we 're also going to add a healthy dose of black pepper by the way that 's where the name comes from.
you can read about that in the post.
so , while the bacons cooking i 'm going to take two eggs some more black pepper dimension that 's an important ingredient some fresh parmesan or pecorino, romano cheese or a combination of both she is perfect.
so we 're going to put our grated cheese in there with that up, and set that.
aside , alright are bacon is cooked or hopefully in your case, guanciale E or pancetta when it looks like that going to turn that down to low as it goes.
and we 're going to put on our pasta to boil now.
the pasta water is an important aspect of this sauce, so we 're going to use that water is the pasta cooks to finish this sauce.
so what you want to do and by the way, i 'm making this for two people.
so i have about six ounces of raw passed in there.
so i 'm going to take about a cup of that pasta water and add it to my pen.
and again that 's just on his low heat, as it goes does cooked.
i 'm going to drain it and toss it with that.
black pepper bacon mixture by the way, if you 're wondering why that looks kind of dark.
i 'm using a whole grain brilla plus pasta, which i love once.
that 's mixed drizzle in your egg cheese mixture, so going to stir in the egg.
it 's going to hit that hot pasta, and it 's going to form a really creamy rich.
but not cream based sauce alright as soon as it 's combined like that, turn off the heat.
throw in your cheese.
i 'm using half mono, half reggiano parmesan.
mix it around, and you 're ready to eat.
so , anyway, that 's my version of authentic spaghetti carbonera, like i said smoke bacon, not the best choice, it works in a pinch.
but try to find some pancetta.
and i think you 're going to like this even more without that smokey flavor.
it can be a little overpowering.
and if you want to serve of course, a little more black pepper and a little grated cheese and by the way, the name carbonera or at least the story, i believe the name comes from all those little specks of black pepper carbon and since this used to be served to coal miners it all makes sense kind of a double entendre, which is not telling it 's french OK now.
i 'm just confusing myself anyway all the ingredients are on the site.
if you want to give that a try and as always enjoy.
