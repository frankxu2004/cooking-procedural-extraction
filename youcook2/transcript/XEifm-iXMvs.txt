personally comma welcome to titties, busy kitchen with me.
take any hard whenever i 'm traveling in the middle east or north africa.
i love to eat the falafel and my egyptian colleagues tell me that they make the best falafel.
but then every egyptian man i 've ever met has told me.
he 's a really good cook cannot.
there are many variations of falafel, and i 'm just going to show you a simple one, but you could look at my website for different versions.
i 've taken two hundred and fifty grams of dried chick peas, and i 've soaked them overnight awarded warning.
never , never, never use tinned, chickpeas because this happens who where did they get it.
ha , ha, i 've got one small onion coarsely chopped two cloves of garlic coarsely chopped two teaspoons, each of coriander powder and cumin powder for teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of baking soda and half a cup of freshly chopped coriander.
i 'm going to do is process the chick peas.
and i 've got a one litre processor.
so i 'm going to be different through patches.
do scrape around approach?
this means for better minute, quite fining texture.
the other half when you 've processed your cheap peas process together the onion and garlic they love it into your chick peas at noon.
the korean and the heart inspired scenes and mix.
well , want it all nicely mixed.
take a piece about the size of a golf ball 's press.
it firmly into a ball shape OK that looks good and you should be able to make about fourteen or fifteen falafel.
now you can shallow fry these if you like.
but i 'm going to deep fry mine at a hundred and eighty degrees scene for about three minutes, after three minutes remove from the oil and drain on some kitchen paper.
now that i 've got my falafel, i need to make some deeps for my tahini source.
i 've got six tablespoons after heeney paste.
the juice of a lemon one crushed clove of garlic, and half a teaspoon of salt.
i just makes all these together.
thank you for the good whisk.
and you should end up with this lovely creamy dip for a cucumber mint dip start with half a cucumber peel.
it between harmel scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon, then greater slash put the flash in a bowl add in one crushed garlic clove that two tablespoons of freshly chopped mint and a cup of yogurt, then mix well, season with that pepper, make sensor falafel with a cucumber, a mintek under tahini.
source , greater supper someone great mystery that remains from all of this is whether or not egyptian men are better cooks and egyptian women.
all our egyptian meant simply full of true next time until, please, busy kitchen, with me today.
until next time for that happens.
