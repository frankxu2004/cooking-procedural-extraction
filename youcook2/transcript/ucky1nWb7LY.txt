hi guys, i 'm laura vitali and unmissable sort of learning the kitchen.
i 'm going to show you how to make an avocado, BLT.
now i constantly get request for like more salads or sandwiches just kind of quicker things to eat and bill T is a classic.
but i 'm throwing in the avocado.
because i really like it.
so let me take you with the ingredients.
so we can get started i 'm going to eat some thick cut bacon some bib lettuce, or boston lettuce whatever it 's cold in your store some sliced tomatoes avocado a little bit of lemon juice, and fresh parsley extra virgin olive, oil salt pepper and the bread of your choice, i am using just gorgeous, italian bread and.
so round loaf and i 've cut by half inch slices off of that.
but you can use whatever bread that you like it 's up to you and the first thing i want is the oven printed to four twenty five, and i 'm going to toast my bread and cook my bacon.
at the same time in the oven.
now i 'm going to cook my bacon, all i 'm doing right.
now it 's just drizzling my bread with a little bit of olive oil and what i 'm going to do with my bacon is i am going to cook it on my broiler pan here, or you can use any kind of pan that you can put a rack over.
because that way the bacon fat kind of drips down and the bacon cooks evenly does n't cook, does n't sit in fact.
so i 'm just going to put my baking sciences on here.
and i 'm going to put the bacon in the bread in the oven, the bacons wo n't take about ten to fifteen minutes.
the bread should take about ten minutes.
the ovens on at four twenty five once they 're done, will pull the whole thing together pretty much?
i just took my bread out of the oven, and i 'm going to work on the avocado.
no , i 'm done.
is i 've had it i 've taken out the stone and we take half of.
this , and i 'm going to put it into this bowl now.
what i 'm doing is because i do n't want to use mayo.
i 'm going to match half of the avocado and the half of the avocado is going to act.
is that creaming component that would be on your BLT, which is classically mayo, but i do n't want to see other lemon put in some lemon juice?
stop it from browning and give you some color pinch of salt and some fresh parsley.
and i 'm just going to take a fork and just mash it all together.
so i have that done, i took my other half of the avocado, and i just sliced it.
i also took my bacon added the oven, and we 're pretty much ready to assemble now.
i 'm going to take one piece of bread at a time, and i 'm going to divide the mashed avocado mixture between the two slices.
i looks good.
takes some tomato slices.
you can use any kind of tomatoes you want.
and of course, you do n't have to use the avocado if you do n't want to you.
could just use regular mail and make a regular BLT, but i like it this way right so nice, you know, it 's nice twist?
it 's a nice change anaclastic.
i want to season the tomatoes with a little salt and pepper.
and that 's good and just a little teeny tiny drizzle of olive oil on the tomatoes themselves like less than a half a teaspoon.
now that you have your bottom layer i 'm going to top it with the bacon, not to the other slices.
gonna take some of this avocado that we 've sliced and i 'm just going to divide that whether to remaining slices season avocados with some salt.
because you know, avocados they need salts.
because we 're very bland 's.
they 're very rich in flavor, meaning they 're very like when you taste in avocado.
it 's not like a light thing.
it does taste very rich, is going to not have healthy fats in it?
but it is relatively bland imputing lettuce on the wrong side tap.
the avocados so little bit of your lettuce and then just pretty much unite.
the two and that is done whoops.
that 's gorgeous, that is, money so bad.
so easy in jamaica, this, if you want to this way.
but you can make it more traditional without the avocado it 's completely up to you.
but if you want to get this recipe, or debbie, debbie, debbie dot lorena kitchen dot com ask you.
next time bye , bye.
