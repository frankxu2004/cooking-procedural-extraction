hello , it 's DD again welcome to DDS.
today , i 'm going to teach you how to make a great dish.
it 's a side dish.
it 's a dip and put it on peter bread, and do whatever you want with it, it 's called hum.
most this is a form of a chickpea spread with some great sesame E seed paste.
some garlic, some lemon juice is just great now you can serve this peter bread.
you can put it on a chick in, dip it with vegetables.
i 've seen this of all kinds of different forms.
what you want to do is start off with can of garbanzo beans or chickpeas now.
a different, different stories, different labels call it different things.
but you want to look for garbanzo beans or chickpeas.
you want to do is give them a quick rinse.
what i 'm going to do is just pour off the water.
there are packed, then it was just a quick rents in some water, not a big deal very easy to do C R winston.
you want to add this to a food processor.
now , some people use blender.
some people use food processors whatever is gonna mush it up at the student food processor next in greeting you 're going to add is to haney.
it 's spelled T A H.
I N I this is a sesame E seed paste.
want to give it up a little bit of a mix just because the oil from the sesame E seeds goes to the top.
so give it a nice little mix.
i 'm not a big measuring person.
but you want to add about fourth cock to a half cup, depending on your taste.
the tahini mixture you can just add it directly to or you can measure it.
yeah , next in great.
you want to add, which keeps the homeless, really moist an from chunking up is some yogurt or sour cream.
you want about you want about half cup to a fourth cup, depending on texture we 're going to start by adding about a fourth cup of it and then depending on the consistency we can add more you want to add about three or four dis.
leaves of mint freshmans gives a really nice flavor you really do n't see it in the mixture.
it 's just a little hidden flavor that 's in.
there she just add those directly to the food processor another thing you want to add, is the juice of one lemon?
again lemons, a great thing.
it gives it a little bit of a zest, porta ingredients is garlic now what i did.
is i have two close of garlic, you might add some salt to the garlic?
'cause when you have it in the mortar help, smash him up.
not about it.
you want to add about half a teaspoon of the, of the salt mash.
it up just like that, just add it.
now you want to have you 're going to want to give the mixture.
let it mix for i 'd say about two minutes before stirring your door, combining it when it 's being processed.
the tahini makes it a little bit thicker.
so again depending on the consistency, you can add a little bit of water to add a couple of tablespoons.
i 'm going to finish processing.
this , and then decide on that.
now i just remove the top and with a spatula do n't use any metal spoons or anything plastic spatula.
you can check the consistency of it.
let me show.
you see right there a little bit thick.
i think i want to add, maybe two tablespoons of cold water.
just helps a texture again.
you still have that fourth cup of yogurt leftover.
so we 're going to give us a taste and see what else it needs, needs a little bit more lemon.
what you can do you can see that your consistency is right.
you do n't want to make it more watery.
you can add some citric acid, citric acid is a form of lemon that 's concentrated open add.
but i have a teaspoon of this, you do n't want to add too much 'cause.
then will be too lemony just going to add a half teaspoon of this to the processor.
the salt was fine when i tasted it give it warranties and see how it is no amazing.
perfect again depending on what you like, you can add some more solid.
you can add less garlic.
you could add more garlic.
you add more lemon juice.
it all depends on what you like.
those are the main ingredients that i gave.
you , i 'm going to show you real nice way to serve it in order to spatula get my get most of it depending on size rip late maybe not all of it, you can serve it in a dip bowl.
you can serve it on a plate like this make it all fancy.
anyway , you like.
do you want to spread it out?
i spread it out in the dish just like this spending on the size of the dish that used when i leave a little bit of in the middle and i 'll show.
you are going to do with that after you spread it out in the plate chop up, but two tablespoons of some parsley, what i do.
is early put this in the center of it, or you can put in along the side, depending on what you want to do?
you can get some olives decorated with some olives.
some radishes, whatever you want again, depending on your preference, you can use either cayenne pepper or paprika, alectis, peppery got this.
i do n't take away from the flavor of the actual dip.
this put it along the sides gives it great color and really does n't take away from the taste of it.
then a final thing is the olive oil.
again you 're going to want to use extra virgin.
olive oil just put it around it, it keeps the depth moist and the nice flavor to it.
just like that, and that 's it now imagine serving this to your friends.
how great does that look enjoy it in tuna next time for the next recipe at DDS motor training kitchen.
