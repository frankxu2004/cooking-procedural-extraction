hi , i 'm katherine.
i 'm an editor.
ask lynn and today we 're making caesar salad.
it 's pretty simple in terms of ingredients, but it 's all about the technique.
let 's first start with what we 're going to be using today.
we 've got romaine lettuce eggs, lemons, fresh garlic, parmesan cheese olive oil extra virgin anchovies, and that 's it.
so , let 's get started to crush the garlic with a garlic press, you can also chop it up with a knife.
but that 's way more annoying.
so we 've got our garlic here now.
we 're going to just chop up the anchovy a lot of people, feel like entities are gross.
you just need to get over that, right now.
it 's really just like yummy salt.
all we 're talking about.
and we 're going to mash it up so that it really kind of just becomes paste.
and actually the original caesar salad, which simon majumdar talks about in his article was made not with anchovies.
but with worcestershire sauce, which contains anchovies so that 's kind of the same flavor, but it 's just like a dash of sauce.
instead of the whole anchovies and now we 're going to separate an egg, there 's a few different methods to doing this.
some people just run it right through their hands.
i just do the kind of back and forth style and there you go.
i 'm going to wash my hands now.
'cause i have egg white on my hands.
and that 's unsanitary.
so we 've got the, the raw egg.
and we 're going to mix it all together and now we 're going to add half a lemon and the lemon juice.
the acid from a lemon juice is going to essentially cook the egg.
did you get that lemon in there?
and then i 'm going to whisk it so that it really gets well, combined now.
this is the part that is actually a little bit more of a technique thing.
this is where you 're going to mull, safai olive oil into the egg mixture here.
so when you 're doing this you can mess this up, so pay close attention.
you have to combine the olive oil very slowly in a slow stream mixing all along.
and you can take breaks if you feel like you 're getting stressed out, and you 'll notice that it 's kind of looking like it 's picking up a tiny bit.
and that 's the egg and the olive oil working together now, all you have to do is a great that, she 's in.
so this is a micro plane grater.
i know a chef who says that this is the sexiest kitchen, implement that you can buy, and i would say you put, you know, a quarter of a cup or more.
this is basically going to kind of impart a creaminess to your dressing, you can put as much as you want.
now you are at the point where you can add your lettuce, so i just rip it with my hands like this, and i put it pretty.
big course pieces.
now another big benefit to doing this table side is that you really should eat this like pretty much right after you dress it 'cause it gets like the dressing is pretty heavy and kind of get soggy and gross quickly so.
now you toss and you really gotta toss.
it pretty well, because it 's thicker, but you really have to get everything coded.
and then you finish with a little bit more cheese on top which as much as you want it, there like really interested, you can put.
so much that you ca n't even see the green of lettuce anymore.
but that 's kinda gross there, we go and we just made a caesar salad from scratch.
