do you like fried chick in, well, what about korean fried chikin i 'll be making my great aunt 's recipe for these delicious fried chicken wings and making them two ways her version and mine using the same sauce.
so are you ready alright?
so i have ten chicken wings.
and i 'm going to cut the tip of the chicken wing of you can leave it on the kind of creep me out a bit.
but i 'm going to cut the wings in half so you have nice drum, let and wing apart or whatever.
you call it, then you 're going to wash it, and dry completely, that is very important.
so i have around twenty pieces there, and i have a combination of flour and cornstarch about one cup.
each so mix it together, and then you 're going to get each piece of the wing and ridge it into the mixture and pack it on.
and his coat each, and every wing till your done.
now for the sauce you 'll need five tablespoons of light soy sauce one tablespoon of sesame seed oil, one tablespoon of brown sugar three tablespoons of white sugar mixture, one tablespoon of red hot pepper flakes A dash of black pepper.
one big tablespoon of garlic.
oh , yeah, some honey four tablespoons, two stocks of green onion that 's been chopped up and mix it all up, looks good already, so, that is enough for ten wings.
so you can double the recipe for the twenty wings in a deep pot or pan.
i added enough canola oil for it to be two inches deep and had it on medium high heat or three hundred and fifty degrees with a thermometer.
an , i added half the wings, so, i added ten wings around ten wings to the first batch, making sure to tap off.
so flour cornstarch mixture before frying it.
and i had it in there for ten minutes around the halfway mark.
i started flipping each of them or at least trying to flip some of them around and cook it for ten minutes.
around ten to twelve minutes and with a strainer in the bowl i took the first batch out, if you 're using a deep fryer.
we probably do n't have to do this.
but if you 're doing it on the stove like i am a lot of the flower mixtures, sinks to the bottom, and i want the oil to be clean and not get on the rest of the wings.
so i took it out in between batches.
so as much as i could, and then.
now i 'm putting in the second batch of wings and doing the same thing cooking it for ten minutes.
so i 'm cleaning the oil again in early yeah, it, looks kinda.
then is the second frying process, so i put all of the pieces of chicken back into the oil.
and you 're going to cook it for around eight to ten minutes and flipping it halfway through, if you can then take them out and put them on a strainer.
an they should look very crispy, so version.
one is my great aunts, so take each wingan lightly.
dip it into the sauce.
real quick, you do n't want it in there too long.
or it was soak.
but that 's basically all you do just lightly coat each wing and the wings are delicious.
just like this, the reason why i asked for the recipe 'cause it was.
so delicious, but if you want to make something great even better did, was i heated up the sauce in a pan on medium heat until it started to bubble and then i added all the wings to the sauce turned off the heat, and just mixed all of the wings in the delicious sauce.
make sure it 's fully coded in that sauce.
and then top it off with some sesame E seeds in your fried chickens, are done?
and they looked so glorious and so delicious.
the wings are sweet.
garlic lee garlic, garlic lee, slightly spicy has a slight kick to it depends on how much hot pepper flakes.
you put in an also crunchy, yeah, so delicious, do you hear that crunch?
now i 'll try the other one to show you.
how can shoot the other one is or for science music to my ears after giving both of them a try, i kind of prefer mine little bit better?
but they 're both delicious give both of them a try, it does.
i heard it 's very easy to do.
both i hope you guys try it out and let me know.
if you do have a great week, you guys next time bye.
