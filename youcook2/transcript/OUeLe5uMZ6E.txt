that 's hello in arabic.
i 'm chef come out on your cooking with come out lebanese style, i 'd like to show you a recipe from my cookbook classic lebanese cuisine.
this ones on page two, it 's crispy herb patties or in arabic, it 's called falafel.
now we 're going to go through the ingredients first.
and then we 're going to go ahead.
and i 'm going to show you how to prepare this very easy.
what 's nice about these as you can make them in advance, you can freeze them and then fry them when you need them or just make them and go ahead and fry them right away.
which is what we 're going to do today so the first thing we did now i soak these overnight.
yesterday , have already drained and dried them so you take one cup of dried garbanzo beans, you can get these in specialty markets.
their garbanzo beans are chickpeas now, if you have trouble finding any of these ingredients.
i have an online store called shop canal dot com, and you can go there, order things that you 're having any difficulty finding and their ship directly to your home.
i 've soaked these overnight with four cups of cold water and a half.
a teaspoon of baking soda.
now the baking soda will just help soften the been 'cause we 're not going to cook these the.
next day the following day, you could just leave these out at room temperature, covered the.
next day we drain them, and then put them on a kitchen towel and dry them off and they 're like this we really want all the ingredients that go into the food processor to be dry.
because we do n't want our mixture to be too moist when we mix it all up.
so here are garbanzo beans then we 're going to take two tablespoons of freshly chopped garlic you 're choosing , garlic.
i always like to squeeze it before i buy it, make sure that it 's not for us and that it 's not sprouting from the top.
then , that will sort of ensure that you 're getting very fresh garlic a quarter cup of chopped yellow onion.
this is yellow onion, or they call it brown onion.
in some grocery stores were going to use a quarter cup of chopped parsley, a quarter cup of chopped cilantro at a quarter cup of chopped green onion.
now all of these i rinsed and dried in advance.
so that they would n't be full of moisture.
so the first thing to do is put the garbanzo beans, just food processor.
it 's fitted with a metal blade, and we 're just going to go ahead and add olive our ingredients that we 've already chopped up the reason we want everything coarsely chopped like this.
so that we process that it will end up all sort of the same size there wo n't be having different things that, that need to process a little longer.
so it 's sort of news is a good starting point sort of empty all these ingredients right in and the thing is, is everything is dry?
so i do n't have lots of moisture.
otherwise , the mixture it 'll be hard to sort of like the mixed travel together.
and we 're just going to pulse this.
so we do n't want to puree it to a point where it 's just a mush.
but we want to keep some technical team.
so you keep processing this take it, and we sort of scrape down the sides a couple times, and i 'm gonna show, you that sort of the consistency deployed to war.
you want to keep processing, and i pulled some little by little, you have a little more control, that way, and so.
it seems to start to hold together a bit.
but you really want it to stay a nice texture.
now you 'll know it 's done when you can take a little bit in your hand look at that, see it holds together, and once it does, that, and you do n't have to press too hard it holds together, then we 're ready.
so actually, that 's it.
we 're going to go ahead and transfer this to a bowl and then we 're going to add the spices.
it smells so good, this just the smell of the garlic and the fresh cilantro, the parsley in the onions.
this is so delicious.
and when you fry them, they 've become crunchy and crispy.
then , we put a fresh made tahini sauce which is called the detour, which is lemony and garlic, and we just eat them.
we dip it and eat them, they are absolutely delicious.
it 's a great order for lunch time.
so that 's the mixture now, what we need to do is we 're going to add, i have everything mixed in here.
this is actually a mixture of one a quarter teaspoon salt, a quarter teaspoon of black pepper, a sixteenth of a teaspoon, cayenne pepper three quarter teaspoon ground coriander and two tablespoons of all purpose flour.
now you want to add this just before you 're going to make them.
the reason is, is that the salt is going to start making the moisture drop from the onion?
so just before you 're about to start making the falafel shaping them whether you 're going to fry them or freeze them, it does n't matter.
you want to add this just before go ahead and mix this.
now i 'm gonna show, you two different ways to make the falafel, patties if you have a falafel mold, which is n't necessary to have.
but if you have one that 's great and you can make these if you 're going to make falafel often i would suggest looking into purchasing a falafel mold.
and again if you ca n't find one locally just go to shop carmel dot com.
and we have them right online.
and we can ship them directly to your house, so, once this is mixed, well, OK, now we 're just going to go ahead and portion them.
i 'm gonna show, you two different ways.
either without using a falafel mold or just using your hands OK, show you the falafel mold.
first it consists of two different pieces.
it 's sort of spring loaded apparatus that has this little handle that you hold onto and this is really convenient.
'cause you just pull this down with your, with your thumb.
and then you take this paddle, and you just pack on and it 's about two tablespoons and you really press it to shape the falafel.
and you make it a little dome shaped look at the spring.
it springs up, and you just transfer it to your tray and do that again.
OK tina slow down and how easy you just transfer them to the train.
now this is why it 's important that all the ingredients are n't full of water.
when you start because you want this to hold together.
now , let 's say you do n't have the falafel mold.
you can just take about what 's two tablespoons and you just make it into a patty, and you sort of flatten it between your hands there.
you got i just make them a little dome shaped.
there you have a falafel patty and you can make this so with or without the falafel mode.
you can make these in pay and then we 're just going to take raw sesame E seeds.
you do n't want to use toasted sesame E seeds.
because they wo n't stick they 'll stick when you put them on here.
but when you go to fry them to come right off and you just take a little bit and you sprinkle the tops of your falafel, patties, and just press it down with your finger OK, we 're going to go ahead and make a few more of these, and then we 'll head outside to fry them.
OK , so i preheated the two cups of canola oil in a small saucepan.
you just want to make sure that you have at least an inch depth of oil in whichever.
plan you choose to use so i brought it to three seventy five.
so we 're going to go ahead and fry about four of these four or five of them at a time.
the reason we do n't want the oil to be too hot is 'cause we really want them to cook all the way through and to get nice and crunchy on the outside.
so that the beans will cook through to the inside as well.
i think i 'm gonna go ahead and put about four end when you first put them in just leave them alone.
do n't touch them for a couple of minutes, let them sort of combined together and hold together?
and then you can start pushing them around a bit.
and once there are nice golden color you can remove them.
i 've double lined up dish with paper towel.
i 'm going to transfer them to that dish and then we 're going to go ahead and dip them into a tahini sauce of the tahini sauce that we 've made is also in the book, it 's half a cup of tahini, which is the ground sesame E seed, take that, first, you mash one garlic large clump of garlic with salt using a pistol, then, you add the tahini, a half a cup of tahini, you mix that around, and, you add, a third of a cup of fresh lemon juice quarter, cup of water and a quarter cup of finely chopped parsley and you get this garlicky, tangy, lemony flavor.
tahini sauce, which is perfect to get the falafel issue.
OK , so now after a couple of minutes, we 're just going to go ahead.
and i 'm using a slotted spoon so that i can take them out in the oil will drip off and i can put them on my paper.
towel aligned dish to absorb the rest of the excess oil from them, look at that, how beautiful they 're beautiful.
golden brown color and see the sesame E seeds have stayed on because they were wrong.
now if you use toasted, they wo n't stick they 'll just fall off while you 're frying them.
so let 's go ahead and put another four in and then we 'll try.
we 'll go ahead and try one of these OK, so let 's go ahead and taste one of these falafels.
now , i 'm going to go ahead and break it open, see.
it 's nice and crisp on the outside the way it 's supposed to be.
it 's warm through beautiful green color, that we 're just going to dip it in tahini sauce delicious, really good, you can make these you can roll them into sandwiches at arch pita bread, or all them with pickled, turnips, tomatoes and lettuce and pour the tahini sauce and just roll it into a sandwich are just serve it like this delicious sustain double health this recipe is one of one hundred and seventy, fresh and healthy mediterranean favourites found in my cookbook classic lebanese cuisine the book comes with a color photograph of each recipe with easy to follow step by step directions you can purchase the book and online venues such as amazon dot com book stores throughout the united states and some countries the book is also available at my shop, shop canal dot com, where you can send inscribed copies of the book to your friends and family it also comes, with a complimentary DVD much of tutorials such as how to roll gray bleeds rolling dough how to butcher leg of lamb and even how to dice an onion, all these techniques would be very helpful when you 're preparing his recipes another recipes.
