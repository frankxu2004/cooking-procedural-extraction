i guys thank you for all of your awesome requests, or we making a number of them in coming episodes.
but today, it 's one for AJ space jam eleven for some mini burgers.
now i 'm going to start by making the rolls for these you 'll need, one tablespoon of melted butter two tablespoons of beaten egg one twenty mils of luke warm water two forty grams of white flour.
now use a good strong bread flour for this, a quarter teaspoon of salt, half a tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of dried yeast.
now to start off just put the yeast and the sugar into that water give it a quick stir together and set it aside in a warm place for half an hour this will get the yeast going and what we 're looking for here is that foam on top.
so it 's time to make the rest of our dough.
so at the salt into the flower, followed by the egg the melted butter the yeast sugar and water mix then combine well and made it until the dough smooth this will take about ten, or.
so minutes, then cover it in a lot leaf layout container, and leave it in a warm place to rise for about an hour.
now this is enough dough to make twenty or twenty five of these.
so i 'm just using half of it he today of course, you can use this mixture and make normal sized bread, rolls too.
so roll out that dough until it 's about three quarters of a centimeter thick and what i 'm doing here is using a melon baller to cut out these mini discs from it there are bad and inshore.
so in diameter, then, brush with a bit of egg wash and sprinkle over some sesame E seeds.
now i 've got the barbeque setup for indirect cooking one eighty degrees.
celsius cook, with the lid down.
of course, use your oven if you like.
and these will take eight to ten minutes to cook, and there 's a delicious to eat on their own, as well.
so now for the rest of the burger, two, hundred grams of beef mince here i 've got some bacon, which have cut into squares.
some chase losses, which are also cut into squares.
some many roma tomatoes, which are sliced some rocket and some barbeque sauce of course, use which ever condiments, you like.
now i 'm just giving these beautiful light, seasoning with some salt and pepper mix it together well, and then between two sheets of baking paper , gently.
roll it out until it 's about a half centimeters, thick.
and once that 's done, put it into the freezer for about twenty minutes, and this will help at all hold together.
natalie cut out the burgers.
i 'm just using a glass here, you can use a small cookie cutter.
if you like, and you want to cut them to a size that 's about a centimeter or two larger in diameter than you rolls.
because these will shrink as you cook them then simply cook the bacon and the burgers on a medium hot barbecue, plate, and when there about half done just placed those slices of cheese under the burgers followed by the squares of bacon and cook it until it melts and.
now to assemble the burgers.
so cut one of those mini rolls in half put the burger cheese and bacon on top followed by a bit of that barbeque sauce, a cherry tomato, a bit of rocket.
