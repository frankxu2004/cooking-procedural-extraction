hi guys, today 's very requested tutorial, will be sushi for beginners?
the rice on the outside method to be more specific.
now this is n't a professional version.
just a simple way to do it at home to make sushi that taste right.
we need the rice to be right.
i 'm using this medium grain rice as it was the closest thing to sushi rice at the store near me.
but if you can get japanese short grain rice, it 's even better.
first , wash the rice, see how this package says.
i do n't have to wash it, well, lies.
it 's just not as good.
if you do n't watch it one cup of rice in the pot and add water, the water turns milky from all the loose starches pour, most of it away.
then swish it around some add more water and can see it 's even milk.
you 're looking drain that to repeat these steps a few times until the water is pretty much clearer like this, then drain the water is best.
you can then add one cup of water and it 's time to cook the rice, you can use a rice cooker.
but if your rice cooker less like i am you can do it this way, put the pot on the stove cover and wait for the water to boil four minutes for me.
and you should n't peak like i did.
but i could n't help it.
i always peek.
now turn the heat to load.
but that cook for about twenty five minutes, covered in the mean time, you can prepare the seasoning sushi really, just means seasoned rice.
so this is a super important step.
but all you need is rice vinegar sugar, or your favourites, sweetener and salt in a glass mix, one teaspoon of salt one and a half tablespoons of sugar and two to three tablespoons of rice, vinegar and stir until it 's all dissolved this ratio is just what i prefer.
it raised to be a bit more salty sour or sweet, so play with the proportions and find out what you like best when the rice is done.
the grades will be all puffed up and there should n't be any water left in the park, folding the vinegar mixture gently.
so we do n't switch the rice.
now we let it cool the thing about rice that many people do n't know, is that it can go bad if it 's not cold quickly enough, that 's why i put it in a container like this, and spread it out.
so it can cool more quickly.
you can even put it in a cold water or ice bath.
i usually just wait until it 's no longer steaming, and stick it in the freezer, covered while they make the fillings making vegan california rolls just replacing the crab or pull up with veggie tofu.
this deep fried tofu has little bit ease of veggies in it and it 's pretty tasty on its own.
it 's also known as Q tofu, but be careful as not all brands are vegan.
the rest of the ingredients are what you 'll find it in a regular california roll avocado slices.
cucumber , matchsticks, i also have some minced, scallion greens for extra delicious nahs to roll your sushi get a few things together.
i have my bowl of cold rice is sushi rolling mat.
this is a bowl of water and a towel to stop the rice from sticking to the mat.
i wrapped it in some plastic.
if you prefer not to use plastic, you can use a sheet of parchment paper as a non stick barrier grab, a sheet of nori and folded across the long side.
then it will be a cinch deterrent to, to lay the nori with a textured side up what your hands lightly and grab a handful of rice, spread it on the nori , gently.
if the rice starts ticking just what your hands a little bit more just try to cover it evenly.
but do n't lay it on too thick even this might be a bit too thick bottom sprinkling.
some sesame E seeds on top now press the price down firmly you can use a spatula or just your damn hands.
now flippin, ori over, and it 's time for filling lay the fillings evenly about this much too much.
and it wo n't roll properly use them at to grow the side closest to you over the fillings and talking into the other side squeeze gently then release and keep rolling.
and it 's rolled all the way give it a firm squeeze along the length trying to be as even as possible, then roll of sushi roll.
i find it easiest to cut the rules after they 've been rested for a couple of minutes.
so just keep making rolls until you used up your ingredients.
now for the tricky part, cutting the sushi into mackie piece is the best thing to use, is a very sharp knife that has been moist, and a little.
my knives are n't the sharpest.
so the best one for me is this small serrated knife whichever knife you use we firmly while cutting do n't press down too much.
just use a back and forth motion and let the knife do the work for you.
i 'm cutting them not too thinly as well.
bigger pieces hold together.
but they should be small enough for you to eat in one bite and that 's.
it served with soy sauce and wishabi.
if you like and eat vegan sushi is.
so easy to make and it can be.
so healthy as well, please check out the links in the description for more filling suggestions, be creative and use what you have on hand.

i 'd love to connect with you there.
bye for now.
