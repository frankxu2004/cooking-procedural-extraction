today , i know this looks weird, but today, i 'm going to be making waldorf chicken salad.
the first thing you do is this is chicken breast.
boneless , skinless chicken breast.
this is a thirty ounce package or one point.
eight seven pound package all, i did was cut the chicken breast up into strips.
oil boil faster, and i 'm going to get it in a pan of water and boil, it.
once it hits boiling if you do it about twenty, twenty, five minutes just to where it 's cooked through that 's the first step.
so that 's the first thing i 'm gonna get this sorted, and then when i come back i 'll show you all the ingredients, chicken first fourth of a cup of light mayonnaise.
you need a three tablespoons of fat free sour cream.
any three tablespoons of lemon juice, and i just use this, this lemon juice in the little plastic things in a fourth of a teaspoon of salt fourth of a teaspoon of pepper.
and sometimes this is the flavor to take.
so , if you put a little bit less than whoever 's eating, it can put more on there if they want you need two red delicious apples.
it 's about a half a pound of red delicious apples.
make sure you get red delicious because they have the flavor and texture.
you want to get those wanted half cups of cubed chicken.
this is a boneless, skinless chicken breast tissue, up until about i do n't know one inch or half inch cubes basically, that 's what you want and then you want one cup of seedless red grapes have grand theft auto and cut those in half and then you want to half a cup of diced, celery i think it 's about two or three stalks you 'll have to just measured out once you top it all up and then we went to tablespoons of chopped walnuts, and you really got to toast these and i 'll show you how to season a pan in just a little bit.
so i 'm going to get started chopping things up like the apples and celery in the grapes get out, and i 'll be back alright, come on the last thing.
i 'm chopping up.
here 's my apples.
i 've got my chicken measured out.
and we got it cup, and a half of think of chicken got everything else the celery chopped up nice and fun, you do n't want huge hunks of celery in there.
but everything else measured out in the grapes, a measuring.
i 'm cutting him and put him in a measuring cup.
you need one cup, filling up this twice.
so what i do is i cut a long ways and then.
i cut him.
so you say.
so i cut it lengthwise like that, and then while i 'm holding it, i could n't side to side.
so then you get these like little force of grapes.
and those are really good to kind of bite their smaller than bite size so it really mixes in.
well , with the chicken and everything, you can see i did n't use all my apple.
i still have three like sections left.
what i will probably do since i have chicken leftover, i 'm gonna have plenty of grapes and plenty of celery.
i 've got planned everything by the way that was about two stocks of celery was what that was.
i will probably make another only two smaller batches of this, this will probably make about i think it makes about four cups.
and i will tell you the calories and stuff, too, but i think it makes about four cups with just this batch.
and then, and then i 'll, i 'll make up the rest in see how much chicken.
i have left here which is probably about as much is that so i could probably make two batches.
i 've got enough apple.
i believe and maybe a little less on the second batch in the first batch.
maybe i 'll grab a little bit of this and save it.
because i probably scooped it over this is probably a little bit of a heaping cup when i was making him.
i could take a handful of heat.
and for just a piece of those answers inside and mix it all together and do another batch that way she 's got enough to last pretty much all week.
long they will last in refrigerator for about a week.
so anyway, let me finish getting chocolate.
i 'll show you how to put it all together and how to toast the almonds, walnuts, and then put it.
all together like i wanna say, how do you toast walnuts what i do is just get up and this is a non stick pan?
i have i 'll put it on about medium high about six a little bit higher than medium it needs two tablespoons of walnuts.
i 'm literally measuring out my wallet because you want in your calories to do measurable, you know, you want to have sex at the calories and literally.
i 'm going to let it sit.
there does n't look like much but that i had a lot of flavor and you get really big pieces like this, what i 'll do is.
sometimes break them into smaller pieces.
this did spread out a bit more in the flavor will be there.
but you do n't need big hunks of walnut in, there.
you just need small pieces.
but these will once the pan starts, heating up it, will you do n't want barnum will get hot pretty fast india is breaking with your fingers, they 're not hard alright, so, while my walnuts, while the pains way to heat up in seven, you 'll start smelling a menus.
all you gotta do is shake the panel, did to keep them from sticking?
it 's not that big a deal you could even turn the heat up a little bit higher, if you want medium high, they can go a little bit faster.
you can do that too, just keep user nodes and you 'll know.
so basically you 're not chicken i 'm going to add not apples and just dump him in a big bowl and the grapes.
and i just like to add the fruit in the salary.
first , i like to add all the bigger ingredients first.
and then what i do is i kind of turn this tour.
it kind of mixes it all together, you know, roughly mixing it together 'cause i do n't want any big hunks of chicken in there with nothing else.
really wanna look at everything and then.
the lemon juice, lemon juice keeps your apples from turning brown.
i think that 's the only sole purpose forward and actually, then i 'll go ahead and put my sour cream and mayonnaise and if you want to go and dump your salt and pepper on top too.
it 's not going to be a traditional chickens out, it 's really just with the flavor, something just to kind of bond.
it just a little bit.
and then i 'll start up more once i get my walnut.
so the walnuts are still going over there.
so i 'm just going to give up little bit of a shake alright there, you can smell you can smell more than anything.
and like i said, you do n't want to burn him, but you can start smelling they start smoking just a little bit.
once you get that, you literally just pour might in here a little sizzle and that will add.
you would n't believe how much flavor that is, those and they have to be toasted because there 's just a regular walnut lawn.
add that flavors.
because when you toast the walnuts, it brings up the oils and stuff in the nut and really brings out the flavor, so.
so that 's it.
that 's really it.
i 'm going to get a little taste for salt and pepper.
this is, i grab a little spoon.
google taste good little bit of everything in there.
get that really tender chicken that crunch of the apple and the salary that sweetness of the grapes it 's wonderful, so, that 's perfect.
so what i 'm going to do now is we got these along time ago.
these who bought these little containers at walmart only know they make me more, they probably do they 're just rubber made containers.
but they have a screw on lid and there are two cup containers.
if you fill it up to this line on the inside.
so that 's how a portion amount.
now let 's take a scoop, and i get it right up until about two cups, and tammy might want more salt in the salt and pepper in these, she might know a little less.
that 's what i 'm going to do.
so i 'm going to get these divvied out.
and she 's got a meal for the next.
she can eat dinner for the next four nights on this.
since i made extra, she might.
actually , i know, how she is sometimes she ate this for lunch and dinner, last time.
we used to make it fun doing this time.
maybe i do n't know.
i do n't know.
so anyway, it 'll last a good week.
in the refrigerator may go lower and that i think the apples and stuff will tend to get a little startling will fall off.
if you wait, too long, but i may help you limit over too, so that 's it.
i hope you enjoy this recipe.
i think it 's a good low calorie alternative.
we will come back, you know, just posted the calories.
you want me to come back and say what the colors are whatever we may be back or time, you 'll just posted this text after this.
what the total calories are one way or the other.
will let you know, we got the total calories for each part, two cup conserving alright, i 'm back?
i want to see how many calories are in each two cup bowl, is right around two hundred thirty calories?
we wait everything as we were going.
we calculate the calories out based on internet calculations for the different weights and turn thirty calories is not bad for a two cup serving of that chicken salad.
so hope you enjoy, and will catch you.
