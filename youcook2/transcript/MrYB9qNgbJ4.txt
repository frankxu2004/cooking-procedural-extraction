we are going ultra fancy in the news nine kitchen today.
you got truffles lobster escargot fiddle heads, what else is are we call the substrate, escargot with lobster.
so , yeah, we started off.
we meltdown some truffle butter put escargot in give a little toss and this is something you have on the menu.
right , yeah, we actually, we sell a lot of it.
so little lobster is pretty decadent.
yes , yes, it is.
and we were talking about the troubles that truffles he used in this for the black truffles.
there are white truffles as well, they have different tastes really, or i think black shows a little more pungent for white truffles are a little software little more mild, like i like black triples, could you get that good shot?
so then we just at the restaurant we just do, whatever green vegetables we have fiddle heads, english peas, and then her covert switcher baby, green beans, ice cream color there, oh, yes, the escargot.
how long do they have to cook.
how do you just a couple of minutes you just want to get him hot?
so let me do a little bit of stock.
so we just let it cook down a little bit.
now , i 've never had escargot.
how do you eat them in a little teeny fork, or so, yeah, these you just leave i 've never been a big fan of cinnamon sticks in the shells and just that 's a little too fancy for me?
yeah , give it a little bit of heat.
we had a little truffle oil just to, just to add a little bit more to it right now the fiddle heads are out right now.
if someone wants to cook the fiddle heads at home at what 's the best way to serve them up, 'cause i think they 're a little intimidating problem, just a little bit of butter and little garlic and just saute them out to him probably do n't want to overcook them right now.
actually , they get a little slimy if you overcook so, but these are perfectly cooked.
and so you just sort of this in a bowl not over anything just like this, and this is on your regular menu, or OK, what are some of the other specials you have going on there at richards these days.
but we actually, we actually just finished a segment called night, full travel, has a chef swap between, between myself and justin leane age from the former commercial street fisheries.
so we actually just book, the.
next ones with jeff page from cotton and.
so how does that work exactly we do a week in between.
so the next ones are august nineteenth and september second and for the nineteenth jeff will come to the, to the bistro look a four course menu, and then on the second i go over to cotton four course menu kinda nice for, you see, other kitchens new ideas this looks great.
