hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with macaroni and cheese the classic thomas.
jefferson style version summary.
the basic steps to make macaroni and cheese and then i 'm gonna show, you in the middle of the video how to alter the recipe depending on how cheesy you want us to be all right.
so all these traditional recipes start with a rule we 're going to melt some butter in a saucepan on medium heat, and when it sings listen to this, when the butter sings, when you hear start to foam and bubble you 're going to add your flower and it 's going to make a very light rua very light colored an light texture drew, you 're going to cook that on medium for about three or four minutes just to cook out the starch in the flower.
i 'm going to add some time.
some cayenne, some white pepper into the root now, why did i just add that to the finish cream sauce because i vaguely remember in culinary school there?
some spices and herbs flavors that are oil soluble and they come out better and oil than just in liquid environment that could be totally dreaming alright.
so i 'm going to cook that for another minute, and then pour in a cup of milk, whisk it in really quickly make sure the milk is cold.
then you wo n't have lumps.
ha , true cold milk.
then , i add two more cups of milk and that is going to be your basic white sauce.
now we 're going to bring that up to a simmer on medium heat.
and while it 's coming up to simmer.
i 'm going to gradients and fresh nutmeg.
get yourself a fresh nut of nutmeg, an grade.
it yourself thousand times.
better , but if you do n't put in the cheap powdered stuff put a couple drips which is different than drops of wishes.
share sauce, and forget about this salted taste.
i 'm done with salt to taste put in a teaspoon alright do not question it.
you 'll see when that comes to a simmer.
it thickens up, we 're going to let that simmer on medium low for about eight minutes.
in the mean time you 're going to get your cheese.
i have three cups of mix, cheeses i 'm using a cheddar, gouda and gree air mixture, which is quite fantastic.
turn off the heat and your cheese in a couple additions saving about three quarters of a cup for the top right now.
i had these cheeses leftover, but for you, i think you should use all cheddar.
that 's what time.
is jefferson used vermont cheddar?
but to any cheese is your favorite cheese is at work.
i think a sharp cheddar cheese really is the best.
but hey that 's just me and with the heat off that 's just going to melt in there and it 's going to make this beautiful, creamy, cheesy sauce.
so all our cheese is melted.
in , in the last thing here, i 'm going to add a teaspoon of dijon mustard.
i do n't like dry mustard.
i 'm going to use a whole box which is one pound which makes a very still delicious version.
but not, as cheesy, not as creamy much lighter much lower fat, if you want to split the difference, you put in.
so adjusting the amount of pasta, you can really alter this recipe to your personal taste.
once you decide make sure that passes well drained.
dump it in the no need to butter.
it do n't believe the hype is not going to stick by my stick.
a little bit OK, you scrape it out going to pour in your cheese sauce.
distribute it, then you 're going to sprinkle over the rest of the cheese.
then the secret to a perfect macaroni and cheese crust you only want a half a cup of bread crumbs, and you want the japanese panko bread crumbs you two can find them.
yes , there in the story.
yes , do n't argue there in the asian section of your grocery store, then just a tablespoon mix it up, put it on top that 's going to adhere to that layer of cheese on top and you 're going to get the best crust ever going to put that in a four hundred degree oven that 's kinda hot.
i know, but i want the top to karma lies and brown, i mean, i 'm not trying to cook the inside.
i do n't know why you would cook this for like an hour at three fifty or a lower temperature.
i 'm just trying to brown the top everything else is cooked at four hundred, it took me about twenty minutes just watch it when it 's brown take it out and you 're done perfectly crisp or having to let this cool just a little, and i 'm in a dish it out, and it is truly amazing.
now see the holes in the pasta seattle whole of there on the left the elbow for the one pound package of pasta those are not going to be filled with cheese sauce the pass is going to be very nice, very tasty, very cheesy.
but it 's not going to be like running with cheese sauce if you use the eight ounces of pasta version, you will have a lot more cheese sauce.
so it 's up to you thomas.
jefferson , the inventor of macaroni and cheese also the author of the declaration of independence our founding fathers fought for our right to put in as much or as little macaroni in our macaroni and cheese as we damn, well, please.
so never forgets the principles on which this country was founded, and that 's it.
macaroni cheese how easy was that go to the site.
get the ingredients, and as always enjoy.
