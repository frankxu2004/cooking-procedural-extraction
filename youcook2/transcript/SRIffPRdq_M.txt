hi guys, i 'm laura betali analytical sort of lowering the kitchen.
i 'm going to show you make penne vodka, now.
i 've done so many people requesting for this recipe, and, i mean, it 's so easy, but it 's really, really delicious.
and this is the exact recipe we use at our restaurants.
so , i know, you guys are going to love.
it was a huge hit every time.
let 's covered in green, so we can get started.
we 're going to some crushed tomatoes.
some vodka heavy cream dried oregano hot pepper flakes small onion finely, chopped.
garlic minced you need some olive oil.
obviously , song pepper penne pasta and parmesan cheese.
but this is just to make the sauce.
so let 's get started.
let 's go over the stove and start picking up our onions and garlic i have a nice deep pain here with about two tablespoons of olive oil and you can use regular olive oil not the expensive extravergine stuff and, i 'm going to put in its not heating, it 's not too, too hot which is fine, and i just added my onion.
and i 'm going to cook this is over medium heat on a pulled over medium high.
and i 'm just going to cook this to get to bow, kind of translucent.
i do n't want it to get two, two colored about five, six minutes or so, my onions are perfect at this point.
they got a little nice color on them.
i 'm going to put in my chopped garlic and let just cook for about a minute or so.
i 've reduced the heat to medium, medium high, was a little too hot?
i 'm going to let this clip for a minute now.
after a minute, i 'm going to add in a pinch of hot pepper flakes, and you can add as much or as little as you want.
it depends on how you like your food, and i 'm going to add in a nice pinch of dried oregano, dried oregano and fresh original with any dryer and fresh herbs for the dryer.
but you put him in at the beginning of your dish with fresh herbs.
you put him at the end the driver everything to develop their flavor just going to OK perfect.
now i 'm going to add in our vodka sub regular not flavored vodka.
you do not want flavored vodka, you would n't put like vanilla vodka and hear anything.
it would just be horrible and put this in, OK, and i 'm going to let this reduced by half my math does reduce by half concentrate all the flavor.
now we 're going to add in our crushed tomatoes.
i get every little bit out of the twenty eight ounce.
can okie, doke give a sister?
oh , yeah, this is gonna, be so, so good.
now i 'm going to knock the back, not the heat back to medium, low partially cover this just like that and let this cook for about forty five minutes.
and you want to come in and stir every ten minutes or so, just to make sure nothing sticking an after about thirty minutes, get a big pot filled with water.
get that to come to a boss open and your pastor.
but otherwise, the sauce is the code for forty five minutes, my sauces in cooking for forty five minutes on low, and it 's exactly how it should be very, very thick.
that 's perfect is about ten minutes away from being done, which is exactly the perfect time to add the pasta.
so you 're boiling water just kind of my nine AM, using penne with lines on them.
they really grist for the sauce really well at that in salted water.
make sure you felt it well.
you know, the rules should be assaulted them in a terranean OK back to this.
we got past the end.
have a season that at all actually OK put the heat up to medium season, it?
salt , and pepper correct just going to give this a quick little taste.
where is my spoon?
i lost my spoon, so i 'm just going to exactly the perfect amount of seasoning, but that 's good.
so now i 'm going to add in the heavy cream very, very important.
when you making vodka sauce OK.
but my heat up to medium with sons bubbling as much as i would like it to some just put it up to medium, high, incorporate your cream in just like so.
and this is going to cook for another eight minutes or so.
i 've had my sauce cooking about eight minutes now and also, during my past.
i 'm adding just a couple of fresh basil leaves SMS fantastic off.
i wish you could smell this.
it 's really amazing.
now we 're going to add our drained whoops are drain pasta that you want to make sure to cook al dente nothing worse than overcooked pastor.
you can turn it off at this point and just mix it from the bottom, up just like.
so i 'm just going to continue to make this, and then we 're going to go over to the table and put this up.
everything is pretty much mix.
now the last ingredient, very, very, very important, in this fresh parmigiano journal, and we 're going to give this a good grade.
but a quarter cup of this in here and this really, really rounds out the sauce, i mean, without it, it 's.
so good and everything.
but with the fresh parmesan there it just makes it that much better.
it makes it restaurant quality which is why it was such a hit in our restaurant and now, i know that my dad would be very proud to see this.
because it was one of our best sellers, and i was thrilled to be able to share with you , guys.
OK , dan scott, right.
but quarter cup and you want to make sure you lose a good tommy.
john did john, i mean, i know it 's a little bit more expensive to use the authentic stuff.
but it makes a world of a difference.
and if you 're trying to achieve that restaurant quality taste in your own kitchen, then just go ahead and best in like twelve bucks and buying a good piece of permitted journal rather than buying, you know, the little tubs of pre grated cheese for like four dollars, i mean, who are they kidding, stuff is dry and it just smells awful and the real stuff is really worth it.
so this is, this is done probably done all i need to do is.
this , a test before i played it, it smells so good or was commit big bite like dynamite.
i could eat this entire pan and look at that from cooking sauce.
low and slow look how thick that is, you see, there 's no liquid here, there 's no water coming out from the tomatoes.
it 's not going to do that, because we cooked it for so long at the perfect consistency.
this is amazing.
i hope you guys enjoy spending time with me.
i would go ahead and make this, because you 're going to absolutely love it.
