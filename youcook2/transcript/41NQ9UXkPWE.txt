cha , pips it 's nadia again.
this one is a special one to me because i am from rome, and it 's something that we eat very often there which is the carbonara spaghetti.
now you can make spaghetti carbonara.
or you can make rigatoni, alla, carbonara whichever way.
they taste awesome.
an it 's a dish that is typical of my region, which is the last year regent.
and it 's very, very simple.
there is certain ingredients that you must, must, must have to make sure that is that it comes out as tasty as it should be and for this recipe, you need.
one charlotte, which is a form of bacon, i would guess anyways is the cheek on the pig, and she to is an OK substitute for it you will get a very tasty carbonara with.
this , the next ingredient there is some must is a carino cheese.
you can look down below in the description and i 've spelt it.
you can find pig reno in these supermarkets.
here i have big reno romano, typical roman piggery knock this different types of pegorino 's if you can find a green or a mono is the best.
so we 've got about a hundred grams of pancetta eighty.
grams of pecorino three eggs, black pepper and two hundred grams of spaghetti out these quantities are for two people usually for the carbonara.
you put one egg for each person, so one and one egg, one egg for a hundred grams of spaghetti is for one person.
i put reacts because one gets lost in the pot.
so is one at each and one for the part as the water is boiling.
we 're going to start with the first step of the carbonara.
detectable , you put it all inside the pen, with nothing else, it 's got fats in it.
so you do n't need to add oil something else.
and you just let it sizzle a little one of the bunch of pisces, ling, i 'm going to get cracking literally with the eggs.
so i 'm taking a little bowl and put in the three eggs.
you add the eighty grams of pecorino you get very generous with the paper so that 's going to be about have a teaspoon.
so now we 're going to add also a pinch of salt, which i forgot earlier, but hey, i am not perfect.
so now you do n't want to put too much salt because the vantage i salty.
so we 're going to boot after teaspoon of salt you get a fork.
and you get cracking now guys.
this is a simple as you see.
there 's nothing else involved no creamy.
no single cream addition, no milk.
this is the original tasty carbonara.
you tested in the italian, restaurants, ann one important thing, do not put pirate jammer in the car banana?
it is not the right type of cheese, it will give you a completely different taste.
now you see the manchester is giving out all the nice sorry oil giving out all the nice oil the you want.
because you 're going to use this punctata and put it in the egg mix and then keep the pen for later you going to put some spaghetti in it to get all the mines little sauce, and juice, i guess that came out of the bun cheetah mixed with it.
so keep the band, our washer i ready do n't try this at all this, is something i just learned?
most right OK, almost got it.
anyway , it is ninja roman exercises when the panchita goes slightly crispy as you can see you are done.
so we 're going to add this to the egg mix.
OK , let 's do it.
OK , you see these oil from the can say to we 're going to take advantage of these.
so do n't use the pen or dump, dump put away your pen or wash it.
because once spaghetti have cooked we 're going to determine just to get all the last bits of oil.
now you want to make sure that you take the spaghetti out.
kapil minutes before the end of the cooking time that mean, it 's you dig him up at eight minutes.
so the one you keep mixing them with the egg and pancetta, even though there 's the hot and are still cooking they 're not going to go or, like mushi just wanted to show you, you 've got a bunch of the bits in it.
you give a nice store again.
OK , you want all those oils and teas to mix into the egg and the pecorino with the pepper and solve everything together married camera.
ooh , another instagram follower how exciting so now this is done guys.
we 're going to put this pasta inside the panda, we used earlier so that all the stuff gets mixed.
gonna give it a nice food.
shaky , shaky, shaky.
i want the spaghetti to catch everything that was left from our unchecked the work that we did earlier.
so now we 're going to and our mix to it.
cameron also did some of the spaghetti.
i want to get everything that i 've used today.
i 'm not going to leave anything to anybody.
so now again OK spoon, and forth let 's get cracking.
so you want to make this OK, this is all done off the cooker.
you do n't want to cook this spaghetti is hot.
so , if you keep mixing it for a good five minutes it will cook just enough as the carbonara needs to be cooked as book that i 'm not sure.
anyways , i am always right because i am not english, so when i make a mistake, no one can tell me anything.
anyways guys, i need you to look at this look how it this is developing into something spectacular look at this, and mixing it.
OK , this is like the work of god himself.
