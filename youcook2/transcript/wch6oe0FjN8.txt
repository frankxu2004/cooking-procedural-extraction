i am chef jet tila, with schwan 's home service today.
i 'm gonna show, you.
how to make my famous pineapple fried rice.
i miss you a really cool way to use the jumbo cook shrimp and the fried rice let me show you by starting with the pineapple, so the first.
we 're going to make is cutting the pineapple right in half, leaving the top on so line up.
the knife find that midway mark cut trend around find that mark again, and you split it perfectly in half.
you 're only need half of the pineapple, so let 's put this one away for the next round.
and i 'm going to show you how to carve the actual pineapple bowl.
so first thing to do is just carve a bowl out of the pineapple from the middle will make a wedge from each side, will go a little deeper in last time and that 's it?
we 've got our pineapple bowl.
we need to make pineapple bits.
so you want to take the core out.
we wo n't need that.
and then just cut little tidbits out of what 's left will do a little section.
so next ingredients, garlic ginger scallions with the garlic, you just want to pound it, and then give it a really rough pass.
we do n't want it to fine it might burn, that 's it.
all i want to do is refinement, so, let 's square it off, cut tiles will cut slivers from the tiles.
so now with their tiles together slivers, and then slivers into mince and finally scallions.
and i 'm going to do is just slice my scallion.
so i 'm going to cut these into thirds first.
line them up.
and they just cut them on what we call a bias or angle slice.
so now it 's time to fire going to turn our flame to high show with a little bit of vegetable and will always start with aromatics were going to ginger and garlic.
i 'm going to wait till we get a little bit of a sizzle.
we want this to cook down just a little bit, but just so you can smell it.
that 's really what tells you that all those flavors are coming together now, it 's time for the rice.
really want the rice to kind of get some of that love from the ginger, a little bit from the garlic and get nice and hot and then bring those shrimping time for pineapple and scallion, and save a little bit of the sky in for garnish at smelling really good.
so since most of the ingredients are already cooked, you just want to bring this to temperature, and you want to make sure your seasonings are fine will turn that off.
and this plan of a fried rice is done all that 's left is to played up.
we 're going to load right into the pineapple bowl and do n't forget your garnish pineapple and a little bit of garnish.
some cilantro works really beautiful, and do n't forget about the scallions that you had before run it up.
and my favorite part tasting you little pineapple in there.
