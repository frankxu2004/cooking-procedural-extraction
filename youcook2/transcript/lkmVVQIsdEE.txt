how you doing it 's kevin long from big night entertainment group.
and this is this something that i 'm not super expert at, but i try real.
hard this is some mcgeary tuna and salmon.
so basically you 're in a geary, the root of the word, basically means finger, finger of rice.
so we 've got some prepared sushi rice over here.
and you 're simply going to form the rice and put the fish over it.
we have some super nice yellow fin.
tuna , the idea for a negari cut on the tuner is to really kind of take, take the fish, and you 're going to cut it really at an angle.
so you could see i have the square block here, going to cut this at an angle, your first piece can use for something else and you 're just going to cut another thin slice to produce this sort of angled cut, then we 're going to do basically the same things a little bigger piece with the salmon.
we 're going to do that same sort of angled cut here.
produce these nice, thin almost like bias cut pieces of fish.
so when you 're operating with your prepared sushi rice, you always want your hands damp.
so that the sticky sushi rice wo n't stick to your hands.
you do n't want to get too wet, you just form this little, little football, almost you do n't want to crush the rice.
just want to form it fairly.
gently undraped the fish over it traditionally form in a way that big nice piece of fish draped over their formed over the rice.
so it 's that same little shape.
you start out usually kind of crush it a little bit, people are usually scared to not crush it, enough for, you know, to keep it together.
or they 're scared that they 're, uh, you know, and they over crush it, you want to kind of find that, that happy medium.
there were here where your fish comes out your rice comes out nice and sort of held together.
but not really smashed try to do as much as you can with the one hand on the right so.
you do n't pass it to the other hand, that 's the same thing with the tuner basically, goes over gets a little formen gets turned around just going to get that right balance of keeping your hands just wet enough where that rice does n't stick to you i will spin around forming that.
so that basically the fish kind of drapes over the sides it 's pretty simple.
but that is, that is basically how you put it together.
so a little mcgeary of salmon and tuna.
so here we go i 'm kevin long, the executive chef with big night entertainment group, and this is some simple mcgeary of salmon and tuna.
