today , we 're going to be making pepperoni and bacon pizza.
this is a real meat lovers, pizza, and i 'm going to be doing this on a stone so it 's tonbak.
just like you get at your local pizzeria the first thing that we want to do is grab ourselves, some pepperoni, and let 's slice that up.
here 's a little closer.
you can slice the pizza thinly or thick whatever way, you like.
and then the next thing that we need is bacon.
and what i 'm doing here is, i 'm just slicing the baking up really small.
so that it 's going to.
so that it 's going to fry up much easier in my frying pan, so.
let 's get all that cut up and will get that into the frying pan , alrighty.
the next step is to fry offer bacon in the frying pan, and the reason why i 'm doing this is that i just want to make sure that the bacon is thoroughly cooked.
so , let 's try that up.
and then we 're going to let it cool earlier in the day.
i made a recipe of pizza dough.
this is for a thinner crust pizza and out of that one recipe of dough.
i created two dough balls so the first thing we need to do is roll out ardo with the rolling pin, can see?
that 's a really nice though you can see the air bubbles the little air pockets in the dough.
now i 'm going to flower my pizza peel, and i 'm going to pop that on there and what the flower is going to do is go.
it 's going to let the whole pizza slide right off the pizza peel or the pizza paddle, and it will slide right on to my baking stone with these you can either do this with flower, or you can use cornmeal which a lot of people like.
but it makes a little bit more of a mess in your oven.
so we got down the sauce archies, and.
now we 're putting on the pepperoni.
and then i 'm going to get some bacon on there alright.
let 's just get the rest of that bacon on.
and then the pizza is going to write on to the stone.
the oven is set at five hundred degrees, and i 'm going to let that pizza gopher exactly seven minutes, and here we go only seven minutes later in the pizza is ready.
you can actually see the air pockets in the pizza showing you how hot that pizza stone is and here 's the finished product, and i 'll tell you this is one delicious pizza.
so let 's cut it up and give it a little taste test.
and this is pizza number two and the same thing again.
pop it onto the pizza stone that pizza stone is very, very hot so as soon as the pizza hints that stone.
it starts baking right away and seven minutes later here we have our second pizza already done.
there we go as i 'm zooming in.
here you can see the air bubble way in the back.
it 's starting to deflate that just shows you how hot the air is inside that pizza and here we have the beautiful finished product.
this is a great pizza bacon and pepperoni, yum, yum, yum.
anyway , so that 's it for this video, so i 'll see you next time.
