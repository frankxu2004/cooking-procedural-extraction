hi , i 'm, michelle with modern mom chicken.
parmesan is one of those classic dishes that when you go to an italian restaurant, everybody wants to order, but i know you 're probably thinking to yourself.
it 's got so much it 's fried chicken.
well , i 've got a recipe for you that has half the fat takes half the time and has all the flavor that your classic chicken parm will normally have.
so , let 's cook for this recipe.
you 're going to need for chicken breasts, which i have two eggs, that i 've beaten with a little bit of milk, some season breadcrumbs if you have plain ones, that 's fine, just add a little bit of dried parsley.
some garlic salt, salt and pepper i put a little bit more salt and pepper in there.
just so we make sure chicken is really nice and seasoned.
i 've got four slices of mozzarella literally a quarter of the oil that you would normally use to fry your chicken in.
because we 're just going to drizzle a little bit of it on top and then i 've got what i like to call my masterpiece tomato sauce over here.
and if you 've been following us at all in our youtube recipes and videos you will know that i have an absolutely delicious recipe for this very tomato sauce right here.
so you can go ahead and use your own at home but, i guarantee you, you 're going to like mine better.
so give it a try and check that out, and the.
next thing that we 're going to do is we 're going to just take our chicken that we have pit into the egg and then we 're going to go ahead and dip it into the bread crumbs and butter on either side.
what could be easier than that, so let 's get started with that?
so we 're just going to dip our chick in into the egg and remember when you 're working with chick in do n't cross, contaminate any of your utensils with the chick in or anything like that.
because you will get sam and ella and you will get sick.
so i 'm just telling you your friend michelle.
she 's telling you, you 'll get sick from salmonella.
raw chicken, it is a possibility.
but if you 're safe with it, you 'll be all good.
so between an go ahead and just put it into an oven safe pyrex or stoneware and.
let 's just continue on are chicken is breaded on either side.
and now the next thing we 're going to do is just take some of our olive oil and just spoon just a little bit over the top of the chick in up and down all over just making sure.
you kind of just get it just a little bit drizzled on there.
so that we can get a little bit of that crispiness 'cause it is boneless, skinless.
so again, we do n't have any fat in there.
i 'm going to take just a little bit of salt.
give it a quick sprinkle of salt.
make sure we 've got some good flavor.
fantastic and then i 'm going to take our super duper tomato sauce that we 've made which.
again , i 'll say follow the recipe.
you 're going to love it.
and i 'm just going to spoon just a tiny bit right into the center of each one of these chicken breasts, so filled with flavor.
it 's got a lot of garlic in their basil.
fresh tomatoes my mouth are salivating as i say this.
so we 're just going to put that right on top and then the.
next thing i 'm going to do is, i 'm just going to take my slice of cheese.
and this is mozzarella cheese and just put a slice down on each one easy peasy.
then we 're going to take some foil.
yes , that foil magically appeared out of nowhere piece of foil and we 're just going to cover this up.
and then we 're going to pop this into the oven on three ninety five for about thirty five to forty five minutes.
just kind of depends on how thick your chicken breast pieces are.
so we 're going to put it in the oven, so let 's boogie.
