christmas hey, folks today 's video is about scrambled eggs.
the way i prepare my eggs now is a little bit different than i did a few years ago.
everybody is used to mom and pops eggs, so it 's a little bit.
chunkier little bit more rustic, this is sort of a refined way of making scrambled eggs with the addition of prime fresh whisking, vigorously to make almost sort of like a fluffy custer, desk type scrambled eggs.
i learned this technique at boo sean along with many other recipes.
i love that restaurant thomas colours such an idol to me.
he 's really, really great.
american it represents french cooking, and sort of fundaments behind that hopefully this video teach you guys how to scramble eggs in a different light.
a different perspective on how you can sort of manipulate a product or an ingredient to your liking, and you can always omit things that i put in these recipes, or even add.
things want to cheese or different herbs or cream or different kind of butter or whatever you want you can i.
mean , it 's really all up to you guys.
i just want to really share my techniques with you guys, the specifics of the ingredients.
that 's really why i made this channel, so hopefully you guys enjoy this video.
so , following along and making these awesome scrambled eggs.
so as you all know i do love chives.
in most of my recipes are at least most my savory recipes.
but i 'm going to start off a little bit of butter in my P N and then add my two eggs and start whisking vigorously.
just so it does n't clump up so i can get that really nice custard texture.
it 's where you 'd be so about halfway through the cooking process.
you 're going to add all your ingredients, which are the chives, cram fresh salt and pepper and then continue whisking on medium to high heat, you know, my name yours bored.
so after about three to five minutes on medium heat and vigorous.
whisking your eggs should be ready.
they should have a nice creamy texture to him, but have sort of a bouncy touch to him when you play also.
i want to serve this dish with a side of awesome sourdough butter toast.
i just ca n't live without that, with my scrambled eggs.
that 's good stuff, and if i know where to find me close your eyes dancing and will be free number.
