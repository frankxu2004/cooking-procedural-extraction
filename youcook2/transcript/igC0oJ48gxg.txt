alright you to look at my frying pan again about a tablespoon of olive oil.
and you 're going to cook one large onion, and you 'll start with this, so it can cook till it is.
carmel , ized my kids have a bit of a sweet tooth.
they do not like onions, but if i karma lies it, they do n't even notice or sometimes, they do n't notice that the onions are in it.
so that 's going to cook a while, well, i prepare and chop, the other food.
so , while my onions are cooking, i 'm going to chop up one romaine, a heart into small icy slices, but so you get this broken up.
OK , i finished the lettuce and i start the onions starting to turn a little bit, brown my husband wanted thoughts also would be good.
but i wanted to go with some fresh vegetables.
i do n't like always like going with a can specially since you may go with can in with beans.
so two tomatoes chopped into or diced right.
this is a very pretty color, and it tastes just right for the onions alright.
so i 'm going to add canadine.
turn it down to low, and let that cook while my rice is cooking.
this is about three cups of wild rice cooked in a pressure cooker, a jasmine.
i will use jasmine rice cooked on the stove as well.
but the pressure cooker gives it the kind of machinists that i like pour in the dressing and stir , now.
it 's time to construct your burrito.
you have your tortilla that has been heated in the oven for about five minutes at three.
fifty , you have your lettuce, your tomatoes your rice and your beings then fold it up.
and you 're ready to eat, enjoy your insane vegetarian burrito.
