hi , this is judy at judy in the kitchen today.
i 'm going to show you how to make the easiest minestrone soup, you 've ever had.
first , i 'm starting with my homemade tomato soup, which is really very easy, three ingredient one small bottle of vegetable juice, original flavor is fine.
one half teaspoon of dried basil leaves an one small can of italian diced tomatoes, and i 've got that on the stove.
and it 's just gently warming up will warm up the skillet alright.
my skillet is warming up an i 'm going to add about just a tablespoon or.
so of extra virgin olive oil and going to swirl that around a little bit just to get it all over the pan and to that i 'm going to add about a third of a cup chopped.
onion , one medium size carrot that i have peeled and put a pretty small, and i 'm going to add one medium zucchini that i have sliced lengthwise and then slice um down the links.
so i 've got half round pieces there all i want to do is just allow these to soften up just a bit.
and then i 'm gonna add these to the soup that i had started.
do n't really need to worry about seasoning these because the seasoning is in the soup, and we 're just going to let these saltee and stuff enough?
and when they are about done, i 'm going to add.
one can of rinsed and drained cannellini beans, let them warm up.
and then i 'm going to add that to my suit and will show you what that looks like my vegetables have sauteed an my beans are in here.
my vegetables enter in here.
i 'm going to let it simmer a little while longer until the vegetables are as tender as i want him to be to serve this all you need to do is put some cooked pasta in your bowl spoon.
some soup on top of that, and sprinkle it with parmesan cheese, and you have some delicious.
