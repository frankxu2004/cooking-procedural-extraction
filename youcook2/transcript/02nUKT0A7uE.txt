in my first video recipe, i will be showing you how to make one of my favorite meals.
this happens to be the most austrian issue.
can try and i highly recommend you try it, if you get a chance for this recipe, you 'll need some meat, which i 'll talk about in a second some salt and optionally some pepper about two cups of breadcrumbs, two cups of all purpose flour, just something you have in your pantry nothing to fancy and three to four eggs?
depending on the size.
and also, some lord, we use something similar to concentrated butter.
but lard or a good quality oil can also be used for high efficiency, i recommend you set up three stations using two sheets of aluminum foil and deep plates.
begin by whisking the eggs in the deep.
plate , and lightly season with some salt, then transfer both the flower on the bread crumbs to the two aluminum sheets now seizing the means for this recipe.
we use turkey meat.
however , traditionally either veal or pork could be used lightly.
season , salt, and if you like a little bit of pepper now you can take the meat and completely cover it with the flower dust.
off any excess, and then immediately dunk it into the west eggs again.
let any X, X is strip off.
and then transfer to the bread crumbs you 'll want to ensure that the meat is completely and evenly covered in the bread crumbs, and i find this is easiest.
if you use your fingers to really pat the bread crumbs into the meat then transfer the breaded meat on to plate and continue doing the same with the rest for the full recipe, you can visit my blog health inspirations, dot net where i have the recipe, including the exact quantities.
i 'll have a link to my blog and all my social media channels in the information bar billows to check that out if you 're interested when you 're done breading.
the meat you can heat up the lord in a large deep pan make sure not to hit up too high otherwise.
you 'll burn them eats a good way to test whether the large or the oil is hot enough is to simply sprinkle some of the dry bread crumbs into the oil and when they start sizzling you can start frying the meat fried fish nets before about four to five minutes on medium heat until death golden, and then carefully flip over onto the other side, trying not to splatter oil over a kitchen fry for another four minutes on the other side.
transfer the schnitzel onto a plate covered with a few layers of kitchen roll to prevent a big puddle of oil from forming wash your cooking.
the rest of the meat you can transfer the cooked snit soul to preheat oven, which will ensure that they stay warm and crispy.
we usually serve schnitzel with butter, parsley potatoes anna preserve made from cow berry, which might be a bit hard to find outside of europe.
ketchup is a really good substitute.
and for some vitamins we like having a side salad on this particular day.
we had a solid from the garden with some radishes.
