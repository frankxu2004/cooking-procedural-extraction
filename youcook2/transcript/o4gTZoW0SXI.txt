so the quality of the videos is not prime.
because i did n't take my big camera in my lighting and.
so forth, but you will get to learn how to make delicious thai dishes.
so i picked three main dishes that if you put together you get a time menu today.
we 're going to make thai fried rice with shrimp yom.
it 's an essential dish in all time menus.

thai style that you can serve with the fried rice and shrimp and the third video is going to be a tie delicious dessert absolutely amazing, i hope you enjoyed these videos, and i hope you make a thai menu an invite all your friends and family to share it with you.
let 's start here, are our ingredients cooked rice shrimp and vegetables?
we have enough for one portion on the cooked rice at the crushed garlic light.
brown sugar light so sauce and white ground pepper.
we reserve the rice for later after we have cooked the shrimp and vegetables add vegetable oil to a pan and heated up on medium heat for a few seconds.
now at the proms or shrimp, you can also use, small pieces of chicken breast if you want and cook for one minute.
if you are using chick in you should cook it for five minutes or so.
the secret technique is to use the back of your spatula to massage the shrimp or chick in using a rotational movement.
this will help make them tender.
now add the vegetables here.
we have baby corn carrots onion, red bell pepper and scallions notice.
they are chopped into very small pieces, so they cook fast.
you can also add other vegetables of your choice, or if you like sweet pineapple mix, the vegetables with shrimp and cook for two minutes finally add the cooked rice.
break it with a spatula, and also massage it into the shrimp and vegetables.
so all the flavors get-together cook for another two to three minutes and that 's it to serve the fried rice first place the shrimp or chicken in a bowl, then add the fried rice on top package, well, by pushing with the spatula, clean the size of the bowl, then place a plate on top of the ball and flip here.
you go at a small piece of lime.
and i am ready to eat.
