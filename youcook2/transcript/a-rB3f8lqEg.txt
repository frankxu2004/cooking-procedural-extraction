today , i wanted to share with you, my famous chinese mapo tofu dish.
now i 'm calling it famous.
because every time i cook it, i always get rave reviews, and if you 're finicky mediator who does n't normally like tofu well, you might be pleasantly surprised.
because this dish is really hard.
since we 're cooking this sauce from scratch.
we can actually control the level of spiciness so we can make it super spicy or mild, so with that, let 's get started.
first , the ingredients start with one pound of lean ground, beef.
you can also use ground pork or ground turkey.
but i really like ground beef in this dish, one block of fresh soft tofu, two to three stocks of green onions for garnish one small or medium sized yellow onion, three to five garlic clothes and two and a quarter cups of chicken broth for our saas face, two tablespoons of soy sauce.
i 'm using low sodium.
but you can use regular as well two heaping tablespoons of black bean garlic sauce and for the spiciness, we will be using two tablespoons of chili sauce.
feel free to use half as much if you prefer a milder sauce.
one tablespoon of cane sugar to balance out the spiciness and two tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce, finally will need salt and pepper to taste next.
it 's prep time.
get the tofu into small bite size.
cubes like this about a half.
an inch per piece.
next dicer yellow onion into small chunky pieces since i 'm using a medium size onion, i 'm only going to use half if you have a smaller onion, feel free to use the whole piece.
some green onions for garnish.
and peel your garlic clothes.
i 've gotta head to use a garlic mincer, which helps give that nice even missed consistency next.
let 's pepper thickening agent.
take the cornstarch and in a small bowl mix, the cornstarch in with a bit of the chicken stock, just make sure to mix completely.
see you have a smooth liquid now.
let 's cook start by preheating your pan on a medium high heat and do n't forget to turn your fan on once your pants been preheated.
go ahead and add about a tablespoon of oil to the pan.
you do n't need much because there 's already enough oils from the meat that we 're going to be adding now, go ahead and add.
your , me and stir.
and , break it up into pieces in the pan.
once the meat is broken up into pieces go ahead and season with your sea salt and pepper to taste next to give them, eat some flavor.
we 're going to add are minced.
garlic , after that i like to add half of the yellow onions reserving the other half for later the onions that we just added are for flavor, while the ones at the end will be saved for crunchy texture next, add two tablespoons for two splashes of your soy sauce.
then the black bean garlic sauce and also the chili sauce next carefully add in your chicken stock and finally the cane sugar stir completely until, well, mix.
then set aside to simmer for five minutes so now that i put the chicken broth in there i wanted to share with you.
guys , a little bit of the secret.
so what i want to do is, i 'm letting it simmer for about five minutes and the reason why i want to let it simmer is.
because i want that chicken rock to reduce, and it 's going to have a really nice flavor.
after that reduction in the water kind of evaporates trust me on this and since you never know, if it 's going to taste good i highly recommend you stop the taste path after about five minutes it 's time to thicken the sauce stir in the remaining yellow onions and then adding your cornstarch, just remember to give the cornstarch mixture a good stir before adding it in.
stir , which will think in our sauce once the sauce is thickened, up a bit go ahead to gently add in our tofu.
when 's the tofu is mixed in you can go ahead and turn off the heat at this point as a final step makes in the green onions.
i 've had a chance to try this recipe at home, please let me know if you like it as much as i do.
and i will see you guys next time bye smell so good already, thanks for watching.
