we 're getting into the saint patrick 's day spirit here in the research kitchen with chef justin, wildly.
he 's making irish.
yes , it 's an old irish pancake potato pain to cut in here and.
so we 're going to start out with one half cups of grated potato and the important thing when you 're grading a potato.
they have a lot of moisture.
so you want to take like a nice flour, sack towel, have right here and get the potato in there, and just squeeze it all out really, yeah, you want to get all the water use after you 've graded it.
and then this is what you want.
after this is the start, it 's leftover and it will help bind the potato.
so we 're going to go ahead and do one cup of all purpose, flour what kind of potatoes did you use.
i 'm using yukon golds and we 're going to just coat the potato at the flower.
so i 'm wondering how you got that juice.
i know you said, because it 's not, yeah, you squeeze the water out in the starch will sink to the bottom, and you just drain the water off.
OK , OK, i 'm trying to picture this, and then a separate bowl you want to take one egg OK in about one tablespoon of skim milk, and with, and with the nice whip with whatever you want to say get it going like that, and then if we want to be interactive.
so dump about one cup of already mashed potato came out perfect, those messages and we 're going to go and just incorporate the egg and the skim milk with the mashed potato.
now do you make like regular mashed potatoes of UPS.
yeah , it 's a regular.
so these are, these are going to be a little bit, little bit more fancier 'cause those mashed potatoes have sour cream and cream cheese and also little goodies in AM and then we 're going to take that start that remains about, about twenty minutes afterwards out of there an incorporate that into the mixture and then just some salt and pepper now, how do you recommend making your mashed potatoes.
miley , the skins on boiling for until they are fork tender and then put him in a kitchenaid, mixer and butter and delicious thank with them, while they 're hot little bit careful.
but they 're pretty easy.
and then a greater potatoes that are coded with the flower we want to go ahead and mix in, OK, and you want to get your looking for a kind of like a thicker batter , OK.
and then, you sorry we 're running out of time.
and then we 're going to go ahead and just put him in the pan.
i let him go from, well, yeah, that 's it and just kind of watching her around about three minutes on each side.
delicious ca n't wait to try him alright.
well , we 'll try this in just a little bit.
