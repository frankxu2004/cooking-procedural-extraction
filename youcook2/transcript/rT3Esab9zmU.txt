we are tackling another taco bell recipe because you guys have been asking for it.
we 're making a chili cheese.
burrito , the first step in taco bell burrito, making is taking some oil and heating it in a pan to the hot coconut oil.
we 're going to add onions.
oh , listen to that.
let those cook at other translucent about three to five minutes.
the spices were using our cayenne pepper for some heat meet some heat in there and then quite a bit of chili powder and then.
so much salt and then just mix it together, and you want to do this fairly quickly.
so that your spices are n't burning to the pan.
you 're going to want to take some cornstarch and add it to water and that 's going to help picking up our chili and then just mix it up and set it aside, add some jalapenos.
however , many you want, depending on how spicy like your food, then we 're going to add tomato paste this is like doing like cheap, quick chili, on the stove top mix that in and then we 're going to take our corn starch and slowly add it, mixing at the same time, and that 's going to thin out that tomato paste and just go ahead and splash it all over your love and that 's what i like to do.
so once you 're, macguyver chili sauce has started to come to a boil you can add in your meat substitute of choice.
so you can add like walnut taco mix, or i just bought this like veggie fake veggie, minced meat mix, it around until it is well incorporated after about five minutes add in your refried beans in.
so just mixing your beings until everything is super well incorporated in.
nice and thick, this is going to be like a burrito sloppy joe, and i am super excited to try it, so now that this is all combined.
we are going to add are vegan cheese.
whatever brand you like the most put a nice big handful in there, and then mix it all together again until it 's melted.
now that you have your chili that you just made on the stove in just a few minutes.
we 're going to make our chili cheese burrito.
we 're going to start by adding some cheese to our tortilla cheese.
however , much you want, i mean, it 's really up to you.
and then just spoon in your chili do n't pack it too much because it will burst out decide to do.
so in a dry pan, lay down your burrito.
and that 's going to help the burrito stay together, and then do a quick one on the other side, 'cause that 's where the cheese is.
