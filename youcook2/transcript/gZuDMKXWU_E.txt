it would jump guys and matty, matheson on the chef at parts and labor.
i 'm the fucking burger king.
what 's up you 're here in my house in parkdale.
there 's kids smoking crack outside.
there 's tibetans having a rally for freedom.
i 'm about to show you guys how to make a beautiful cheeseburger.
the best cheeseburger you 've ever had here.
we go get out of the fucking container.
what makes an amazing burger.
there 's a few things that make an amazing burger you gotta start with really good beef.
so we have the beef chuck here which is part of the couch older, you know, it has a lot of fat content.
it 's a little bit tougher.
there 's a good chew on it.
so that 's why you grind it.
so i 'm going to cut this up in little strips.
so here it 's just better to grind your own meat because you 're in total control, you grind it to fresh.
it 's this is not no frills down on king street.
in parkdale gypsy meet you do n't trim off any of this fact.
keep it in there.
the ratio will work itself out.
i always find you do n't have a meat grinder.
go to butcher shop and get them to grind your be fresh.
the main thing that people always do is fuck with the patties and put garlic in it where she shire, parsley crap eggs bread, crumbs all you have to use.
we 've been treated like a steak, but do n't fuck with shit just make a beef patty.
and that 's all you need.
we have our ground beef here.
so now we just have to make the patties you want to make it into a fat patty.
so it 's nice and juicy this is kind of like user.
one hand padding it up, and then you 're putting it down and then your padding it around, you got a pretty good fucking patty right.
it will start with four, four burgers, a family of four, see a lot of people come on grills.
i prefer to cook them in like cast iron pans like a griddle 'cause i find when people are cooking burgers on grills either, fall apart and that 's why people always add crap to it to keep them together.
what we want to do is seer these see all this fat.
these are all going to melt away, so that 's going to create these little cavernous, crispy fat fucking chunk pieces.
and then you 're going to have a perfect fucking burger, so when you cook burgers medium high heat in a cast iron pan is your best bank.
so you want to make it.
burr beef taste like shit, so you 're going to just treat it like a steak right.
i 've already said that so we got the pepper heavily season with salt 'cause it 's a fat piece of meat.
flip it over.
do the same thing because of the fat in here, you actually do n't really have to put fat in the pan?
but a six ounce burgers the burgers that we made today, you want to cook those about three and a half to four minutes.
aside for a nice medium, medium rare burger.
so now we 're just going to let these guys cook in render.
i think the best technique for burger toppings is not to make these big fat things that are going to slide everywhere.
i like to make a lot of thin slices.
so that when you crunch through just like a thousand layers and.
so you do n't get these like big slide around tomatoes all these guys out in the world when you 're cutting, these fucking onions in your crying.
because you have a dull knife a dull knife means, you 're a fucking loser.
you do n't cry if you cut an onion with a sharp knife.
any good sandwich worth its weight has pickles in the sandwich, does n't have pickles in it 's probably going to be garbage, throw it on the floor.
hey , then we need iceberg lettuce shaved up.
i got some pepperchinis.
i like taking a bite of the burger taken by the pepper cheating little spice little heat.
and that 's all you need for toppings.
what we 're looking for when we 're cooking the burgers is that the sides are going to start turning brown, you know, like when you 're cooking pancakes and around the edges, you know, when to put the pancakes get the little bubbles around the side that bubble is the browning of the side of the beat that means that it 's golden brown underneath and it 's starting to cook that 's exactly what i 'm looking for.
see all those little crevices, that 's the fat rendering out empty in the middle super fucking crunchy on the top.
the other component is obviously really good, fucking buns right here is a beautiful egg.
bun see that yellow color egg one.
it just seems a little bit lighter than the, like the wonder bread.
this mush i needed to stop some buns.
always gotta be butter in the buns.
'cause if you ai n't got butter.
buns , they 're not going to be good, so these burgers are almost done.
visit huge break of american cheese, cheese, makes it creamy and fucking yummy.
this is the real deal.
this is n't craft, single cheese.
if you look like a star david, the land of milk and honey good movie all the best things in the world, simple, right, like a hot babe on the beach, she 's got her hair.
she 's kind of naked.
this is the same way you do n't want your shit.
all messed up is the bikini.
this is this, and this is the tequila.
you 're drinking this is the fucking babe right here.
think of cheeseburgers.
babe , you do n't want to fuck with the babe, too much, right.
so we 're going to see in the burgers because we want the cheese to melt a little more.
so we 're going to add a little bit of water put a bowl on top or a plate.
just seem for a little bit.
you do n't want to cook him too much.
they 're done cooking casey that steam hey world cheesy burgers what, you know, about it no address, these guys up.
so we got the lettuce on the bottom.
we got the patty, got some onion, and some tomato.
some pickle does mustard.
i 've got to catch up peppers.
these are the best cheeseburgers.
you 'll ever have this is a perfect cheeseburger right here.
these two fools are about to eat the best burger of their lives.
they 're extremely lucky.
today , we are through our, it 's a big boy burger.
no baby dick burgers, over here, sometimes you do n't have to eat a burger.
do n't eat a burger while your in church do n't eat a burger or you 're getting a blowjob that 's how you make a fucking burger?
eat some fucking burgers world.
