hot dogs recipes that you can grow so i have a lot of these weber recipe books.
this is a special book.
do n't know if this is available in the states for hotdocs?
so there are several hot dog recipes in there, and a lot of other recipes that deal with sausage, more or less in combination with other ingredients.
but it do n't have to be.
do n't have to be hot dog?
so as i showed you in the winter, grilling book.
it 's fun just to make one of these recipes today.
together i decided to make the italian cells.
each , a dog just to make it easy.
i call these italian hot box.
this is what it needs, i put the amount of each ingredient into the description box as always, so we start with an onion cut into hope.
and , then cut into slices same with a red bell pepper.
i prepared more or less for six two eight hot dogs.
the original amount in this recipe is made for four hot dogs.
you already, with cutting put everything into bowl and add some extra virgin.
olive oil and some salt and pepper and give it a good mix next step is smashing some garlic you can use your hand or a knife.
if you want you could cut them into smaller pieces as well.
i did, but i wo n't show you.
so this is provolone cheese provolone is perfect for italian hot dogs, make sure the parts of the provolone as long as yours are teacher.
so these are, hours artesia italian sausage.
it 's made with fresh fennel.
really , great taste cut them into half make sure not to cut them too much.
so they fall apart.
now take your garlic.
some bosonic vinegar some olive oil salt and pepper, i tell you later what to do with the marinade, yeah, prepared my weber mastertouch two thousand fifteen edition fifty seven centimeters.
the special edition with the heavy duty.
prepare them for direct heat for the sausages import directly to spell for my cast iron pan.
just two cook, the pepper UFO pepper and the onions.
after some minutes give them a flip and after approximately another five minutes put them to indirect heat that 's easy and at the provolone cheese now, close the lid, and let it melt.
now take your role and prepare the role for drilling as well.
take your marinade and based each side with the marinade.
and once you 're sausage and the pepper mixture with onion is ready.
put this again into a clean bowl as well, and roast your role.
this is how, how i do it.
maybe there are several things that help as well, and once they are all set for about three to four minutes, be ready to build our docs.
i forgot the parsley.
no take your role, you 'll, says each.
but the provolone cheese and heads, some of that great taste, the mixture of red pepper bell and bell pepper and onions.
