hello , and welcome to crouton, crackerjacks today i 'm going to show you how to make these delicious pretzel dogs.
these are all beef franks filled, and stuffed with melted cheddar cheese.
all wrapped up in a soft pretzel dough and baked to a golden brown perfection.
these the ingredients that you need, so, let 's get started now to start off, of course, i 'm going to make up some pretzels out here.
i have a separate video that shows how i do this.
and i go into more depth in that video, but i 'm just going to give you a basic rundown here.
i 've already got some warm milk and sugar in a medium bowl here, too that i 'm going to add in some butter, and i 'm going to sprinkle some active dry yeast on top of that, and i 'm just gonna let that sit for a few moments to let the use kind of awaken and liven up a little bit.
i 'm going to add in my salt and flour and just using my hand here together until it forms a dough.
and once that comes, together and forms a dough, i 'm going to need it for just a minute or two.
and then i 'm going to lightly oil a bold going to cover this with a damp towel put it into a warm place to rise until it 's about double in size again.
i 'll go into more detail on that in a separate video, and i will put a link to that video, down below in the description box.
now while i 'm waiting for my dough to rise, i 'm going to prepare my hotdogs.
these are all beef hot dogs.
you can use whatever kind of hot dogs that you want sausage for this.
if you wanted to, but to make sure that the pretzel dough actually cooks on the inside you want to make sure that you 're hot.
dogs are nice and dry.
so i just got a paper towel here.
and i 'm going to dry off my hot dogs.
and i 'm just going to set them off.
onto a plate.
and then i 'm going to take some cheddar cheese here this is just a chunk cheddar you can use whatever kind of cheese that you want to this happens to be sharp.
cheddar , i 'm going to cut these into thin slices.
and then cut the slices in half.
you just want a.
small , thin strip, or so of cheese to put inside of.
and you do n't have to stuff to use with cheese.
if you do n't want to you can just go ahead and leave them playing, and then use a cheese sauce as a dipping sauce that 's perfectly fine, i just like to stuff mine because, well, i 'm a cheese addict.
but all you need to do to stuff these is to slice through your hot dog.
you do n't want to cut all the way through you want to leave a little bit connected at the bottom.
so you 're hot dogs do n't come apart.
and you have two tabs.
but you just want to cut a little slit just deep enough that you achieve slice will fit in there.
just go ahead and gently put your cheese into the hot dog, and then go ahead and set that off to the side.
now that we have the hot dogs down.
i 'm going to go ahead and get my baking soda solution done.
i 've got one cup of hot water here.
i 'm going to add in one and a half tablespoons of just plain baking soda.
and you just want to go ahead and start that until the baking soda is dissolved, and then you want to place that into a wide and shallow dish.
i 'm using a pie plate here for that now.
once your dough has doubled in size, you go ahead and take it out of your bowl.
let us into eight equal pieces.
just cut it into forts and then get the fourth in half so you have eight equal pieces.
and then go ahead and set all the pieces off.
inside , we 're only going to use one piece at a time here and to form your pretzel dogs.
you want to take one piece of dough here, and you want to roll this out into a long rope.
this rope here that i 'm using is about two, two and a half feet long, or so twenty four thirty inches.
or so it 's actually quite long once you get that rolled out to a rope.
you want to use your fingertips an press.
this down, flat easier to wrap around your hot dog, and then you want to take your dog and starting at one end, you want to place your dough and leave and underneath the hot dog on the bottom part of the hot dog.
and you want to gently roll this dough around your hot dog, make sure that the dough wraps or overlaps itself a little bit on each turn and you just want to keep rolling this until you get all the way to the other end, and, once you get to the end, go ahead and stretched a little bit.
so the other end sticks at the bottom of your hotdog.
so it looks like a little money here, get these all done at.
now you can go ahead and dump them in your baking soda solution to make them officially.
and , then place them back onto your baking sheet and then before these have a chance to dry, i usually only do a couple at a time.
here you wanna sprinkle, these with some pretzel salt.
this is just, a course grade salt you can find this in most grocery stores, you could also use kosher salt if you really wanted to.
but pretzel salt is ideal pretzels really cheap.
so a little goes a long way.
but it really does make a difference.
so just sprinkle a little bit of salt on the top of each one of these, and then you want to bake these at a preheated four hundred and fifty degree.
oven for between nine and eleven minutes or so, you want to keep it on them.
you want them to be nice and golden.
brown and when they get to your desired doneness.
go ahead and take them out, let him cool for just a minute.
and then i 've got a couple of tablespoons of butter here, and i 'm just going to use a pastry brush.
and i 'm going to brush the tops and sides of my pretzel dogs with this melted.
butter , make my pretzel dough or the pretzels wrapped around the dogs supersoft.
it 's going to flavor these so amazing little butter, makes everything more delicious.
and then you can go ahead and sort of these up anyway.
you so choose, i like tipping mining ketchup.
if you want to do a beer cheese sauce, you can do that, or you could just eat them plain as they are.
and there you go that 's how easy it is to make pretzel dogs at home.
i hope you guys.
