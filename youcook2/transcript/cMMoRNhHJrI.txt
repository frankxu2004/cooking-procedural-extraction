hi guys, how 's it going.
welcome to my virgin kitchen.
i 'm trying out my new camera today.
i used to go pro just the gopro actually on the last video, you guys loved it so thanks very much for that.
the aim is to combine a little bit of what i did there without using this new camera and, and play around resolutions and stuff, so bear with me.
this might not be how it finally looks, but we 'll get there, but i know that was today.
we are going to make some pfaff out.
nice easy chickpea kind of burger things rap.
i 'm hungry for lunch and that 's what i 'm going to do.
so hit pause on a video and write more down unless me, right.
so for the far, far going to make it as easy as we can just by using our mini chopper thing if you have n't gone those you have to chop away a lot right there, folks, here we are with all angry.
it 's not going to use to make this part fails.
i think that 's how you pronounce it.
but some plain flour were not usually that although it be very varied rice and chickpeas that been drained off completely.
so it 's just a chick peas no water, no water, in their lemon half lemon juice.
half a red onion, garlic cloves, coriander chili pepper paprika and cumin that is all going boom right.
it 's nearly all in there.
now i 'm a very close to the edge of, we need to get a bigger one of these where we going to sprinkle the flour on there just about one half.
tablespoons even get a bit more now.
all goes there squares on a little bit of that lemon juice, or your.
and they were going to get a lid on it, right so goes the lid.
and , yeah, let 's give it some worley action.
so the mixture all done it should look something like that.
all nice and colorful and funky we 're going to get it down there on a chopping board right now, yeah, this is a message bits.
i 'm a little bit worried about hitting the pause button on my camera any minute now.
but you do n't need to worry about that.
so i 've got is a little bit in my hands like so i 'm just going to shape it, it does hold it shape quite well, actually.
that 's why you need to make sure it 's kind of dry and eugene those chickpeas properly.
baby making into little bull shapes like this, and then you can have like a bowl shape, well, maybe discussion down a little bit like that do that to all of your stuff.
now , though, OK.
so with the five thousand only made six for the moment, which is plenty as it 's just me here at the moment that do nicely.
but you actually got enough to make double that.
so six times two equals twelve, do you like how i did my maps are kind of cool right?
so rather than from straight away, which you can do with going to push him to one side, and just work on our salary bits, which wo n't take very long at all.
i 'm going to put some spinach rocket leaves that can full of chopped parsley our year.
these are my leftover bits of parsley one spring onion, an free cherry tomatoes or sliced push that all in or, yeah baby.
i 'm just going to trim some kress like maybe half a pun.
it would get in everett just on top of that.
they talk with their just wash tennis dripping, do n't really want the soil in there?
no , no, no, no, no good squeeze a lemon juice, say another half a year.
and i grind in a pepper like a teaspoon, or maybe a little more you feeling kinky now.
i 'm going to get my hands in their combine.
it all together.
and , that is going to really compliment those follow, follow powerful upper foul there.
we go that 'll do nicely want to smell it all, yeah, OK folks once you reach this stage.
so you get salad ready and your files sat there doing everything any other thing to do really is pita bread, bread bra, maybe not.
i just got toasted.
that 's a boring steps along to show you that we 're going to go straight on to frying up fall apparel, fell now alright.
so i 'm just getting a flame there.
and i 'm going to warm up my pan like so little bit of oil, olive oil sunflower, oil vegetable oil not engine car oil that would be bad.
all right, that was nice and hot.
now , but just to show you the upgrades in austin, toasted.
and they 've actually increased in volume a little bit, so it cool down a teeny, weeny bit.
let 's just sit these.
in there are here and here, that says lin nice, and gentle fitting take about two or three minutes other side and will flip them.
and then we can build am.
so once they are done, they should look like that, nice, and browned on the tops, both sides and in the middle, there still be yummy and squishy.
so we 're going to do now is stuff them in a pita, breads with a salad, and maybe a little bit sweet chilli sauce good times.
there 's my thumb.
good times, sorry folks as you can see.
you 've already made one.
so what i did was grabbed pita bread, so an stuff that 's kind of come up.
i 'm just stuff in a low decided in their first of all tucking in the file, file was just sitting in like that.
i 'm going to run a lot more salad in there as well, right on top of it, like this crime, it right in there, all my goodness, and then finish it with a cheeky drizzle of sweet chilli sauce.
oh , my goodness.
i want to put that in my mouth right away.
white folks thanks for putting up with me for this video, i know i 've been a little bit serious.
but i 'm trying to understand the camera for example, the last five minutes to spend trying to take a picture, and it would n't work.
so i need to read the manual and when i was doing that, i took a big old bite.
and , oh, my goodness amazing, i have another point right now, as like a head nod in pita bread of love, in the chick peas i do n't know if the chick is a feminine reference or maybe it 's kind of a chick in reference.
i 'm loving it.
and maybe it 's latin for like peas, love men, chickpeas equals, pizza love.
i do n't know.
i 'm going to another, so good so quick so easy, going out for lunch is nicely light and healthy and it 's vegetarians.
so if i can make that absolutely anyone is welcome.
