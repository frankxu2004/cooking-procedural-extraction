hello , and welcome to she 's got flavor, i am.
so excited today.
because we 're going to be doing one of our, well, my rather favorite comfort foods, and, that is macaroni and cheese.
you 're going to absolutely love it a lot of people are intimidated by macaroni baked macaroni and cheese.
but it 's really just four stages you have your noodles that you have to cook and season up.
you have your rule your cheese rue that you 'll have to make and then you have your topping go on top of the mac and cheese and then we 're just going to bake it in the oven.
so just four simple steps.
it really is easy.
also , if you rather cook your macaroni cheese on the stove top if you visit my website at WWW dot she 's got flavor dot com and look.
under video recipes.
you 'll see a video for stovetop, macaroni and cheese.
all right so let 's go ahead and get started.
the first thing that you want to do is you want to go ahead and cook your macaroni noodles just as instructed on the back of the box, and i 've already done that.
and i 'm just going to use the same pot here.
this large saucepan that i used to cook my macaroni noodles in an what i 'm going to do is just put that on a little bit of heat.
because we 're going to start to make our room in just a few minutes before i do that i 'm going to get my macaroni noodles here, and i 'm just going to put them into a bowl.
because what i 'd like to do it and some people do n't do this they do n't take this step.
but i 'd like to actually sees in my noodles up before i put it into my cheese rue it does i just poured the macaroni noodles and they 're already done and then i 'm just going to put in a little bit of olive oil and some butter and in order to get the direct exact measurements all, you have to do is go to my website at WWW dot she 's got flavor dot com.
and you can find all the exact measurements.
so i put the olive oil in the butter in and i 'm just going to stir that up.
so that all of our all of my noodles have a little bit of butter, a little bit of olive oil and then the.
next thing that i 'm going to do is.
i 'm going to go ahead and season it.
so i 'm going to take a little bit of seesaw.
some sea salt, wonderful flavor.
so i put a little bit of sea salt inside my noodles.
i 'm also going to add a little bit of pepper just a little bit of the pepper because it 's a little bit hot.
i 'm also going to add some granulated garlic another great seasoning for great flavor and add that right in and in the last season, i 'm going to add a little bit of old bay.
i know you think in obey would that seafood but trust me.
i am the queen of flavor.
you 're going to love it so just put a little bit of old bay.
and then we 're going to do is we 're going to go ahead and stir that up.
so all of our noodles are nice and season, oh, goodness.
the steam from this is already smelling wonderful by adding these seasonings to the noodles.
so now that we 've done that i can go ahead and just put my noodle soup inside i 'll come back and get those babies after i make my room.
and then all i 'm going to do is i 'm going to make my rule again on the same part that i used to make my noodles.
so come on over and take a look.
i 'll show you how we do it.
the eye on my saucepan.
so i have it on high and i 'm just going to go ahead and add my butter.
sizzle , sizzle baby alright.
and i 'm just going to cut it down the medium 'cause i do n't want my butter all my room to burn alright.
so i 'm just going to let that meltdown see that butter.
just meltdown real nice.
and again you can get the exact measurements from WWW dot.
she 's got flavor dot com.
i 'll give you the exact measurements for these recipes and a whole lot more alright.
so i 'm are butter is pretty much melted just have a little bit more to go that maybe will meltdown.
so the next thing i 'm going to do is i 'm going to go ahead and add my flower to my roof.
and when you 're making a roux you want to always stir.
that 's the key component.
here you want to always stir if you stop staring you 're going to be in a whole lot of trouble, do n't worry, it 's going to look a little crumbly.
and i 'm just going to add a little bit more butter to this there.
we go alright that 's better because it, it needs to look crumbly, but you do n't want to look dry.
going to do is i 'm going to start slowly, pouring in you notice.
i 'm still whisking i 'm going to stir in my milk scene, i 'm just staring at in and it 's going to start to thicken and once we have this nice and smooth and thick and then we 're going to add archies and let that meltdown i 'm just adding a slowly in right great this is exactly what you want to see.
i 'm just going to heat up just a little bit of a little bit more heat when the cheese goes into start, melting.
so i have some cubed, velveeta cheese.
and you see that here i just cut him up into cubes and that 's really just to help them melt quicker.
obviously , the smaller the pieces quicker, it 'll melt so i 'm just going to add these in slowly just let it melt up alright.
and if you see your rule is a little bit too thick.
like i think this is just a little bit too thick.
we can always add some liquid to it.
i 'm going to add a little bit more milk so the PM could you do your rule is supposed to be wet.
so you do n't want it to be too thick OK guys, so this is the consistency that you want in the end.
you see how creamy that is, is not watery.
but is creamy, and his cheesy, yummy, yummy, yummy, OK.
so at this point, you can go ahead and turn your fire off 'cause we 're going to do is, we 're going to season this just a little bit.
and then we 're going to add.
are noodles and fold it in so i 'm going to take a little bit more sea salt here in.
season , our room, and just a little pinch not too much black pepper just a little bit.
alright with that end all right so now we 're ready for our pasta noodles and all i 'm going to do is just dump it in two hour cheese rue.
here , let 's just waiting for it.
and i 'm just going to kind of peace this put a little bit in, and stir first, and then i had a little bit more to make sure that every noodle gets a little bit of the cheese.
OK , so now that we have our noodles, an archies ru.
and we have a mall incorporated and they 're happy, and they 're waiting to get baked.
what we 're going to do is we 're going to take a baking dish.
you could use any kind of dish.
i just use the one that i had most handy.
and i just buttered my dish.
now if you want to be a little bit late on the butter, you can always shoot some pam over your dishes, well, works just as good.
so i 'm going to take my noodles that have already been fold in with the ru, and i 'm just going to put them into the pan and spread them out.
once they get in here nice, and then the last thing that we 're going to do before we bake these babies, our or is rather we 're going to go ahead and make the topping.
because i like my mac and cheese to have a nice top game and you 're going to really love the idea came up with for my topping alright.
so i 'm just going to spread this out will be nice and even all right there.
we go and i do n't know if i mentioned preacher, oven to four hundred degrees.
here we go alright.
so that 's our macaroni and cheese noodles with our cheese route.
so now what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to make our topping and what i have here are three things.
the first thing is i 've crushed up some croutons and their butter and garlic croutons and again just like with the old bay.
your language what is you doing, you 're going to love it.
so i just crush them up and all i did was i just put him into a zip lock bag.
and i just smash them up really fine.
and what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to add some melted butter.
and then i 'm also going to add some cheese now.
remember we use the velveeta cheese for the roof.
so i 'm going to use some monterrey jack.
and some colby cheese that i 've just shredded up now the monterrey jack in the cold, be there a mild cheese.
and i like my macaroni and cheese to be mild all the way through.
they 'll be there 's also a mild cheese.
but if you like a little bit of sharpness, you can always mix your topping with some cheddar cheese.
so all i 'm going to do is i 'm just going to pour my butter into my croutons.
i 'm going to add some cheese to it.
and then i 'm just going to mix it up.
that 's all i 'm going to.
i 'm going to mix it up and then after we mix all of this up.
we 're going to get a little dirty.
we 're going to use our hands to put it on top of our baked macaroni and cheese.
so this is the part where we get a little dirty, and we 're just going to take our hands and get into that topping and we 're just going to spread it all around.
it 's fully covered everywhere because you every time, you take a bite out of your mac and cheese.
you want to get a nice crunch.
and then you also owl airing it with another type of cheese.
so it 's going to give it a little bit more flavor, you know, i love the what the flavor.
so let 's go ahead and just finish this up and again.
i had to have my oven there preheating to four hundred degrees.
and we 're just going to cook this for about maybe fifteen to twenty minutes really until the top part, the cheese on the top is melted and the middle has gotten a chance to gel.
because remember the macaroni noodles already cooked.
you made you cook your room, so really we 're just letting it bind.
and we 're letting the top piece meltdown alright.
so , that is, it my dear is, i 'm going to go ahead.
and i 'm going to throw this in the oven, four hundred degrees and as soon as i 've done it 's done.
i 'm going to come back, and i 'm going to show it to you, of course, i gotta, taste it, i 'll see you in a sack alright guys.
we 're done with baking are macaroni and cheese.
and it is gorgeous and i know it 's going to take taste just as great.
so now it 's time to play this in taste, it alright ca n't wait back on.
did you hear that crunch from the top, oh, my god what look at that?
oh , my goodness.
wow , alright taste here.
it 's really hot just came out of the oven, so see make sure i get some of that crunch.
this is another home run.
this is so good.
the crunch from the top.
then , the rule that she 's ruining the different texture and the other cheese.
this is just fabulous.
this is, this is a wonderful OK as i mentioned before i know i said one hundred times, you can get all these measurements at WWW dot.
