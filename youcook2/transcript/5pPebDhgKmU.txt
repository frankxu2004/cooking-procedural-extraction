chicken pot stickers are really fun to cook at home.
and i 'm going to show you a couple tips that will help you avoid disaster when you 're making your pot stickers.
the first thing that can happen is your pot.
stickers can explode in the pot and there wo n't be delicious.
because they 're just going to be watery push.
so you have to make sure to seal them.
the first of all secondly.
i 'm going to show you how to get a good sear on them so they do n't stick to the bottom of the pan.
first thing we 're going to do is put our pot sticker ingredients together.
so i 'm taking my lemongrass here adding all of that in half my garlic scallions, hoisin sauce.
one spoon of that will save the rest for later the little sesame E oil going to mix this up a little salt and pepper.
so this is our pot sticker mixture right here.
it 's just that easy will just go ahead and lay out these dumpling wrappers will just take a little bit of this feeling, put it right in the middle of each one of these guys here a little bit over a teaspoon.
in each one of these remember when you 're working with chick.
anyways want to clean your cutting board down afterwards and wash your hands really well rinse off my fingers.
so the first trick to making sure that you get a nice seal on your pot stickers and they 're not exploding is i 've got a bowl of water here.
and i 've also got a fork going to take my fingers, and i 'm just going to wet them and go around the edge.
i 'm going to fold it in, crimp it with my fingers and get a really nice seal.
they lay them out like this.
you have a methodology to how you 're working can actually do them pretty quick and to take it even a step further.
i 'm going to take the fork and just going to go around the pot stickers, just like that.
they 're really locked in there.
that 's not going anywhere.
they all look good.
you got a pot of boiling water, going here already next step.
i 'm just going to dublin straight into the boiling water butter, bing bar boom while these are going.
i 'm going to let them cook for about another minute.
i 'm turning my nonstick pan on this has been about three or four minutes in the boiling water at a little bit of oil for pan here.
turn it up to high nice and hot.
we 're going to drain these guys out going to be careful here 'cause there 's water in oil and again splatter a little going to carefully put these in here in a single layer, and we 'll just let them go on one side.
so they 're nice and crispy and then we 're going to flip them over and see how nice those are we cook them a little bit before we put them in the pan here.
so that 's going to be the key to making a nice crunchy pot sticker on the outside.
so we 're going to give these about a minute and a half on each side right.
so these have been going on one side for a couple minutes i 'm just going to give him a quick flip.
we 're getting done here perfect, you can use a spatula for this, too i like use a fork.
because you can get under there will give it another minute on this side the secret right.
now is just to get a nice and crispy.
so these guys are done there.
nice and crispy and delicious.
so i 'm just going to take these and put them to the side on a plate.
and we 're going to use the same pan still hot, add a little bit more oil.
and then we 're going to the rest of our aero, matics that we had which is the ginger and the garlic that we had set aside in these scallions, classic ingredients, and that just takes literally a couple seconds.
we already have a nice hot pan, so adding her baby, tatsoi straight into that salt pepper.
even a quick toss, that 's all you need.
this is done add your pot stickers back in soy sauce are mirren in her voice and toss it altogether so.
let 's put it up and see how it tastes.
look at that, so delicious beautiful tatsoi.
nice crispy, potstickers just going to one of these, out of here.
it 's going to be hot, and i 'm very excited about it taught, but it 's amazing it 's delicious, it 's full of flavor.
they 're nice and crispy and check it out, not a single one opened up.
