welcome back to another sushi video tutorial.
i 'm chef developed.
and today i 'm going to show you guys how to make something spectacular.
something impossible, something revolutionary something innovative is possibly the future of sushi.
although it might not be who knows.
but what 's certain is or last hundred years sushis, evolve.
so much from something.
it took six months to make by fermenting rice and fish together to something which is made instantly and sushi bars across the country.
so this could be the future.
basically , i use a suvee machine to cook the fish to an exact temperature.
forty degrees celsius.
and then what happens is the fact dislocates the fish, and you create these assuming size fish flakes, which are juicy and tender and perfectly cooked.
unlike anything, you ever be able to achieve in a pan or pot, and they just magnificent.
it 's a completely new way to load sushi, so i hope you guys enjoy this little video.
let 's go straight into making it, it is the first thing you want to do.
is you want to get a nice piece of solomon with the grain going right across and you do n't want curving of the grain?
so i 've cut it specifically to be like.
so now you just want to make the brian, which is simply five hundred milliliters of water and then six percent salt and four percent sugar.
i just want to let it dissolve inside, and then add your fish.
so it 's been twenty four hours since i 've brian to fish, and i 've just patted dry.
and what happened is that brian has season the fish perfectly and is change structure.
so the albumen does n't reach out the argument is the white stuff that usually coach the outside.
somewhere you cook it and this way of data RNG when you cook it now.
i 'm just going to sit inside this suvi bag, and then i 'm just going to add forty grams of extra virgin.
perfect alright so this part very easy.
just put it inside your vacuum sealer.
make sure it 's aligned properly.
close it and see perfect not easy right.
and does n't matter.
there 's no air pocket with oil because you just want to basically pochette inside oil, that 's the plan here.
so i 've got this vida.
forty one degrees.
celsius , i 'm going to add the salmon.
it are you sure you want to cook the salman to about forty degrees celsius.
and i put the stupid machine to forty one degrees celsius to make.
ago , be faster, and you want to leave it in there for about twenty five minutes, twenty seven minutes twenty seven minutes of is pretty thick piece assignment twenty five.
it is not post after twenty seven minutes.
you call your selling out and then you just let it rest for one or two minutes.
OK , so once it 's cooked what i 'm going to do here is just take a butter knife and get right in between the layers of fat and separated.
so this piece of little bit, small and just like so they come off pretty easy.
an it 's almost like sashimi slices, but not quite because it 's not the way you cut it here OK.
so you just put your knife in between the fat layer and it just comes apart and just.
help is slightly with your hand.
and , this is so softap.
it 's just incredible.
OK , so you place your knife in between the fat lady and she 's just slide in, and just comes off the fish.
like so it 's extremely softap.
because what happened during the softap cooking is the fat has sort of melted and the tender, tender fish is just.
so softap, and juicy that it just falls.
apart ocean, i 've got everything prepared i 've got some avocado slices.
and my salman flakes in pieces which looked like she be i 'm just going to add a little bit of soy wassabi air which you can check out how to make by clicking on the link on the top.
left corner to a.
plate , beautiful, they just pull it out right now, you just add some sliced avocado.
make sure to spread him out nicely perfect.
now , you add your salmon and just finish it off by adding a couple new herbs or something to decorate in this case.
i 'm using some mint and you can maybe just make your air come towards them inside can be fixed in place.
i hope you guys enjoyed watching how to make this delicately cooked some sashimi.
and if you want to make it without distribute machine as possible.
but it would take a lot of effort you have to sit there and turn the gas on and off, and watch it with a thermometer for twenty seven minutes, which would be helped.
so i would suggest just making the investment is the same, as any other cooking machine in your kitchen.
it 's it cost money so if you want to buy it, you can use right now by clicking on the list.
anyway , i guess that 's everything, and i guess there 's nothing left to do but try it who have delicate fish deep inside the soyuz source.
and they did here.
it 's got such juicy delicate flavors of fish and the texture is just it 's somewhere in between cooked and roids remarkable.
i really suggest you guys tries at home.
that 's all and now, i just show you a little clip about my new kitchen, which being built.
OK , so this could be my new kitchen, now.
it 's still under construction as you can see.
i 'm really excited about it, it 's been taking so long to build this.
i have to lay down a concrete floor with tiles.
two point, four tons, of concrete, be exactly that was paying forward.
and i figured out how to do it all by just watching some youtube videos and getting on with it, which is what do you do all about, is n't it?
so , once this kitchen is finished in about two months going to be dedicated to making only youtube videos, and making better sushi video recipes sort of dedication.
