sweet , hardly caroline IMF name.
welcome to my cooking show from middle earth yesterday.
i 'd love to teach you one of my favorite recipes from mushi as a classic shepherds pie to start with.
get yourself a saucepan.
we 're going to put that on to heat little bit of oil up in the saucepan.
this is a really nice simple recipe, and this was my dad 's favorite.
so this dish always reminds me of hope.
now i 'm going to put my chopped onions into saucepan cook onions and silvaco, lovely and soft add human slam.
now , brown left off.
now you can add your carrots.
little dollop tomato puree.
suddenly , and parents give that oil good stir together and pull your beef stock in after the stock.
leave it to simmer, simmer down for about half an hour should be good.
and if you have n't already get yourself, some mashed potatoes are going to need that to put on the top of your pay, the season.
you want some pepper in there little bit pepper into salt after it 's been simmering for half an hour.
you 'll see that the liquid does start to reduce down and go a little bit thicker.
but my secret tip is actually put a little bit of visto powder in, i kind of cheat.
because i like to have a really nice thick like gravy sauce in the meat.
so i 'm just going to sprinkle a bit of this on and mix this in once you mince has cooked.
take it off the heat.
i 'm going to pour into an ovenproof dish in that.
now we need to do is top it with some mashed potatoes.
now you can either just dollop it on and smooth it down with a book or because this shows a special show.
and i 'm very happy to be doing this for geek week.
i 'm using a piping bag so you got a bit more fancy occasion, then you can use a piping bag and just literally pipe on some noise.
it 's open bacon.
i 'm going to do this, keep going until you 've covered.
the whole pie, fit up all those gaps.
this is bits optional.
now this is ready to go straight into the oven.
i will put all the details of the recipe of the quantities oven.
temperatures everything up on my website, so just click the link, and you can have the full recipe.
now this is going to go into the oven for about another twenty.
five , to thirty minutes, until all the cheese is melted, and the potatoes are nice and crispy on top there.
we go separate pie is done.
so i would serve this with some peas.
i 've gotta have peas from having shepherds pie, breaking now, serve some up late and again.
yum , yum him to go with that, a good few peas, but i hope you all really enjoy the shepherds, pie.
