hi guys, and welcome back.
today , mike is going to be taking over the cookie dough.
then he 's gonna be cooking, is world bend shepherds pie search?
professional your sous chef position mikes, shepherds pie my, my favorite of all japanese buyers because it is full of flavor.
i think it 's something we 've perfected over the years.
because we tend to collapse poison.
so much better than maine, chopping things not fair.
so i 'm going to put two clothes of garlic.
i 'm just going to crush them, and then peel them, i 'm going to chop away.
it 's a small diced pieces and then to do a drizzle of all, i 'm just going to break this up before i put it in.
so it does n't burn.
i 'm going to season it before i put it in a little bit of salt and pepper anna get enough you cannot.
do this any quicker when I love sushi at it was done minor right now?
i 'm going to add the meeting so we 're just going to darken the meat and whilst that 's browning.
can i drain the potatoes you can train the potatoes?
so now this means nice and brown, i 'm going to get some red wine, which if you 've had, a glass, already you can just pull the remainder in.
so just stir that in and.
now i 'm just going to let that reduced down to capture all the flavors.
now we can do math papers.
how 's that sound.
this is five hundred grams.
so this phone is.
so i 'd say only about fifty grams, something around such a professional.
so after the bus are we add a bit of salt and pepper mash salon.
and we have some kind of machine that can do this.
we just have you he 's also left the skin on potatoes.
i do n't know if we said these are new professors, so the skin is much better on them 'cause they 're fresh.
i do n't tend to put milk in my mashed potato to go in a shepherd 's pie.
you got so much juice in the minutes as it is that then it kind of takes away from you want it to be quite.
yeah , you want to be quite firm.
this is where my special ingredients come in which kind of gets me renegade which i 'm not sure many shepherds pies have so first.
i get some.
it was the same as you put in spaghetti.
bolognese it kind of adds like a sort of rich flavors, which i quite like.
this is where i need you sushi.
it is time for you to get a bit of gravy granules, or grady powell now very gently.
and she only adds OK, do n't gently add it?
she did n't have to gently.
but i 've got other things.
and then there 's one of the secret ingredient, you know, that is, my done well done once break.
i would love ones.
break those in we just stir that in we 're going to drop the temperature down, if you 've got time to let it simmer it definitely will add the flavor i need my tasting spoon earlier.
tasting gotta, make sure season properly need more pepper, more pepper, yeah, acceptable, i mean, just now this is all mixed in together.
i 'm going to add in the final ingredient, which is these frozen peas.
you can use any kind of like chopped vegetable root vegetables, another piece and there 's a lot of pieces.
so first things, first, we 're going to add the meat just a better that i 'm actually not over doing it, you know, what else is a good ingredient chances ingredients.
it is honestly my kate catch up.
but i put it into overtime, and i could.
now , we see.
if your mashed potatoes up to i think you need it more buster.
but , you know, we gotta.
be healthy with these things i like to go through the middle with dollops and then work your way out.
so how does this the middle whitnell, squish outside.
because i 'm gonna use, a cutting technique which is a fork.
a far off alaskan exactly prob, just push it out.
we did more bus.
it 's a bit dry.
so i like it to be a bit rustic any bit.
sticking up is kind of good.
'cause that means they get extra brown and soul, but sticking up higher will get more toasty, sous chef, do you like to greet is really hard?
'cause it 's really far away from me.
that 's not my problem.
you 're the sous chef.
sue up ready for the oven right, we talk so it gets the grill action.
yeah , make sure you get up.
so how long do you need it for twenty minutes, i would say in our oven, is probably take about fifteen twenty minutes hopefully?
a little less, if you 've got a grill, it probably only take five minutes right.
i think you can hear the sound of that, that 's great.
you are so proud of yourself.
i 'm ready, you know, i would date this time for that.
i do every challenge.
cover it and catch up.
