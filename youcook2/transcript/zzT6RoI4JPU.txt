let 's cook it, hi, here is mom kitchen and will come with makeup on hills, uh, you know, a little bit last days i did n't pay too much attention to my channel, becaus i am very deeply in a writing new recipe book, which one, is taking most of my time?
but between the requests and reactions under videos was one very special and directness force from california, how to make the real crack glass.
two three honest true.
i 'm not sure if is it really track goulash, but check type of clash.
or , let 's say my own glass becaus with glasses.
it , like with many other special recipes, is you have like by theorem is for example, you have one tiramisu in each family is different.
this is same with the plush, so let 's follow.
what do we need of course, beef, and out the little pieces, cubes and equally to the beef, we need onium, then we need pepper africa, salt woman, garlic flower, commander peter doctor, and you will see?
i will go for the go to the garden for my children fresh.
later , now we will, of course cut the onion.
it 's a maybe it 's a little bit surprising.
but you need a lot earlier.
so for the fed, which one, you need for the only on.
because you need to make quiet, very brownish or first only on before meat and other things, uh, you can use, uh, of course, pork fat spec oil, whatever you like it not olive oil be cause this is not in common in our country now, we will hit up the oil.
so we have that cut on your own, which one we are giving and a hot oil herbie is.
now roasting up to will be really quiet, dark color he will see it and do n't be afraid of that BIH cause most women are making this kind of mistake that they have only the glass effect on the audio.
but this is not right.
because this is the taste the brown color.
so we are cleaning up the garlic just to mess shit and do n't make big circulus.
so what you mean.
but you do n't need to be related perfect do you want to know how it looks like the first client for the garage yes it 's here between the time i will sort of be preparing magnetic key this is this.
because this is the classic, try dish to the garage.
but you can use it faster, you can use it for day to some someone like rice and ninety to tell you i love fresh drivers for example, can indicate you have already in our that you will find that in the details, OK, this system better in stage here, be cause this is not ready.
but i want to show you most of the women 's are stopping in this point no, no process, there 's still time to go, and look at a beautiful kinetic key in the work of really nice.
so be patient with the only on it 's a moment we were we will put the garlic inside whynot early.
becaus graphic is very fast burn, and if it 's burned is like peter like half arena fly space now it 's actually very beautiful, smile.
so now we are giving inside the meat roasting be cause the roast fat meat is another.
favor , which one is necessary to be by glass you cannot rush unit, or do it.
last clipper little bit coming, coming is the spice which one is helping to you to digest, of course.
so rich paper i 'm still no water yet.
because we have still in our troops in type and again roasting, roasting and roasting no one is out the water from the meat.
we are giving.
the tomato pillar and we are.
still , not giving any gram of water still roasting.
yeah , it 's actually up to you if you want to have more spicy edge.
sharp one you put red pepper or a chili or whatever.
or you have sweet red pepper powder, or you have already sharp, sharp warning.
so it 's really up to you and with the tomato, peter is also up to you, you can give it less or even more it 's up to you.
but we are still without water because we are getting all the water out.
it 's again roasting, caramelizing.
and it 's all giving the raw arrived real flavor of the crash.
you see, you see the bottom of the box, this is the right nice think, nice flavor, which one, we need.
and now i 'm using over two, two author now.
we will stop the cook after the meat is really nicely.
so another thing what i want to show you do you see it sources nearly click how we need it.
be cause this is made by the only on an by all ingredients, which one we put it already certain the builder and all stuff, yeah, OK and my goulash is also on me.
so garage is getting.
be , nearly today we just need to have a little bit thicker source, so i have the battle which one is nicely heated up.
and i love this kind of gold flavor on the batter becauses, really giving smell beautiful smell over the battle.
and also you need to have it little bit darker becauses for the garage that mean.
we do n't need her bluff, but we need brown and is of course.
also , because of the taste, is better if you make it if you a little bit post, the flower causes getting diff.
some part of taste just like, in the time of my grandmother, she was always using the bother, she was always using nicely, nicely, the flower in.
and actually, when i was small i love to eat it when was called because she had always in one.
what , but always, like the reserve of this kind of flower, which one we called ishka, yeah, this is example, minute the meat or a better the glass you are cooking.
so long time how have to be if you have be cause of course need to be softap meat and.
now when we put the flower inside we need about post minister ten minutes more as i told you we need major and, and i 'm using the freshman from garden.
this is the last touch of the brush.
so do you like it look at the garage.
how looks really beautiful.
and the clearly key successful, as well, and as you see you can put over the fresh onium you can roll puto roasted, on your can actually make the chorus you wish, this is very classic and special for the men and special is the beer.
