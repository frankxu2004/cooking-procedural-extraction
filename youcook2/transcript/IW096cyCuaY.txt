hi guys, today, i 'm going to show you how to make calamari, this is my favorite, favorite thing in this wall.
so different people use their own mix of spices, i 'm just going to show you my version of it.
hope you like it, so let 's get started.
four hundred and fifty grams of squee cut into rings, half a cup of flour one, and a half teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of black pepper powder, one teaspoon of mix her quarter of a teaspoon of garlic powder.
some oil for frying put all your salt and spices in the flour mixture.
stir it well, to mix everything up sprinkle.
some salt and some pepper on your sweet flavor all the layers.
now , this is done what we 're going to do next.
is we will put that in a zip lock bag?
all the flowers so that it 's easier to handle otherwise, accept some messy.
so get a zip lock bag put all your flour mixture inside, and then we will marinate the squeeze inside.
seal it tightly.
and then just take it easy, is n't it?
and so much less messy, i 'm doing it half first and then we will transfer it to another tree.
when all the squeak pieces are well coated transferred them to a separate bowl and shake off the excess flour, it might get a little messy.
do the same with the rest of the imagination heat oil in a pan put disk weeds in hot oil do not overcrowd it?
we will fry them roughly two minutes, two minutes each side.
it 's very easy to make calamari at home, and you get more portion for the price using the restaurants they give you small portion.
we have to share it, and if you make them at home it 's very simple.
send them around on the other side, some people fry them for just a couple of minutes.
i like it two minutes on each side.
but you do it once and then, you know, how you would like them.
you do n't have to keep them on the oil for long because they get hard read said done now.
i kept him for around three minutes, and it looks like there.
krispy shade, the excess oil.
and then transfer them to dish aligned to perfectly and repeat the same with the rest of the scripts.
them , in a serving dish insert them favorite sauce.
and some lemon wedges.
i hope you enjoy guys need them.
it 's very simple to do.
that 's your calamari.
