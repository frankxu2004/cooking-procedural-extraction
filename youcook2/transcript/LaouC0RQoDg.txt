hey guys welcome back to episode, three of waiting lee 's kitchen comments in my previous video, and a lot of you wanted this recipe and i made this recipe before on my block channel and ever since then you guys have been asking for it.
and also i saw some comments that you guys wanted like a vegetarian dish.
this is not a vegetarian because i did put chicken in it.
but if you want to have it vegetarian so i will just take out the chicken.
she is super easy to make.
it 's probably the easiest one you will see.
ever it takes about twenty minutes, including prep and cook time.
well , twenty, five.
what i 'm making today is called mambo tofu.
and i 'm using this sauce packet right here as i said in my previous video, basically, every one of these recipes in this series is going to be really easy.
you can definitely make us from scratch, but i 'm just using the packet sauce because this tastes so good.
and it 's just a lot faster to make in trying to use this is called model down pool, which is a very popular chinese dish the remote like children and older people, older people seniors figure chinese or if you grew up in asian family you probably had this before and it 's just a very safe dish for almost everyone, you can either buy it in the mileage version of the hot version.
but this is the spicy is a guest, and i do n't even think it 's that spicy, if you can handle a bag of hot cheetos you can handle this.
actually , this is not even as spicy as a bag pachios.
so like i said this recipe is super easy.
i do n't even know why i 'm making a tutorial on it because the instructions are just on the back of this box, is so simple?
it will take you twenty to twenty five minutes to prepare, i mean, all the comments if you guys do decide to travel this recipe and.
let 's get started.
so for michael tofu you 're actually supposed to use silky tofu.
but this is the one i have and i did n't want to go out and buy another pack of tofu.
so i 'm using firm, which is fine.
you can use it too.
but traditionally it 's cooked with silk tofu.
it really depends, how much you want to use, i 'm going to use the whole block today.
because i want some leftovers and.
now it 's really up to you how you want to cut your tofu.
i 'd like to have them in little cubes.
the thing i like about firm tofu is that it 's much easier to cut with silk tofu.
i 'm like he did n't want to break it, and now i 'm just going to cut up the green onion into little dices.
this is basically just for garnishing it does n't really taste like anything when you put in the tofu.
but i just like to use it to garnish and now just cut your onion.
this is just for the chicken so you need a really tiny bit.
i 'm just going to use about that much, and i sit for the ground chick in you can use ground, pork ground beef.
it 's up to you, but i love chicken.
so i 'm going to chick in, and you 're going to want to use a big knife like this, if you do n't, then i would suggest you go get one.
because you can use these.
but these just are n't the best for like rounding meat, or if you have a food processor use that.
so to make it a little easier for myself i 'm just going to cut them into small pieces first and then, if you live in an apartment this is not apartment, friendly.
but it 's OK, do n't worry about the neighbors?
my second filet, i 'm just going to put it in this bolango, marinate.
it so marinating this is super simple.
you do n't even have to do it.
but i like to do it just.
because i want my chicken to have a little flavor, just using some garlic salt onion powder and black pepper.
after you have that just mix it together with your spoon, or you can use your hands time to cook the chick in at a little bit of oil.
put your onions in and turn on your fan, just adding your chick in OK.
now that you 're kicking it cost just set it aside on a plate time to cook the tofu.
oily , oily just add in your socks.
so the total comes in a packet like this kind of like hamburger helpers, and, you 're just going to rapid open and ask the whole packet right.
now i 'm using firm tofu.
so it 's not going to break as easily.
but if, you 're using, silk tofu, just be very gentle.
because you do n't want to break your tofu and my way of cooking this is to scoop from underneath that way you 're not stabbing and breaking any of the tokens.
so go from underneath and flip it like your dirty underwear.
and now i 'm going to add my chick in for green onions.
you want to wait till the last minute.
because they cook really fast.
so just wait till the end and throw those into garnish.
so it 's pretty much ready.
i 'm going to add my green onions.
and it 's ready just turn off the stove and put this on rible.
