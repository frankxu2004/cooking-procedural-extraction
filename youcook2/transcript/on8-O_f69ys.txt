hi , i 'm saying cometa and today on dish would die.
i 'm going to show you how to make spaghetti carbonera.
this is spaghetti in a creamy sauce made with parmesan cheese and bacon and it 's simple to make.
so , let 's get started on dish and would die.
so we get this recipe started the first thing that you want to do is get a nice big pot of water and put it on the stove and bring it to a boil.
because you 're going to be cooking spaghetti.
i also like to use angel hair.
so whichever you choose an you 're also going to need pancetta, and this is an italian bacon you see.
it 's about i guess that 's a eighth to a quarter inch, thick and then over here i have some finely minced garlic now.
if you do n't have pancetta, you can also use regular bacon for this little bit more salty.
and it does render a little bit more fat.
so you might just have to like drain in a little bit, when we get to that point.
but it 'll taste the same in the end, so, whatever floats your boat.
now what i 'm going to do with this bacon is just cut it into some small squares.
just like this, the bacon is going to give this sauce like a nice kind of smokey salty flavor.
it 's really delicious, and this is something that so quick and easy, you could easily do this on a weeknight.
so , the other things that i have for the sauce are some grated parmesan cheese.
an i have some eggs here and a little bit of heavy cream now.
the heavy cream is optional.
my husband likes this sauce, a little extra creamy.
so i included, but you do n't have to traditional carbonero sauce.
two minutes so whichever way you want to do it, it 's up to you.
so now my orders coming to a boil, so i 'm going to take the spaghetti salt.
my water and throw it in now, while your pasta is cooking.
you want to take a pan and put that over medium heat and then add a little bit of olive oil in and then take your chopped pancetta and put that into the pan.
now if you 're using regular bacon, you do n't need to use the olive oil.
i just like to throw a little bit in the pan with pancetta.
sometimes it does n't have as much fat as others cook this now until the fat renders, and it becomes nice and crispy, while my page edit is cooking.
and my past is boiling away the sauce.
real , quick, and it 's very simple.
so into a bowl add the eggs and lightly whisk them then take that freshly, grated parmesan cheese and add that in along with several greats of freshly ground black pepper.
now this is another really important part of the recipe.
it just really makes a big difference in the way.
this is going to taste.
then if you 're going to be using the heavy cream.
now is the time to add it if not, then you 're skipping this part and then just go ahead and whisk the whole thing together until it 's really thoroughly combined and that 's it that is your sauce right there and this is going to be wonderful.
so now i think everything is just about them.
so we get over there and throw the whole thing together, now you 're pancetta is.
nice and brown and all the fat has rendered take that finally minced garlic and throw that into the pan and just give them nice spin around, you 're just going to cook this for about thirty seconds just until it becomes very fragrant.
you do n't want to brown it, and this is going to add loads of flavor to this pasta where you take the pasta out of the pot rab.
about a third of a cup of the pasta water and set that aside now my pasta is done.
i like to take it directly from the pot.
and i 'm going to put it right into the pan.
yes , like that, and i do that.
because i like that little bit of extra water in there, i think it helps to keep the pasta from being too dry and toss.
the pasta to thoroughly code it with all the fat in the pan.
take the pasta and pour it right into this nice bowl.
look at all that beautiful pancetta in there it smells amazing.
so now i 'm going to finish the whole thing up, so i have this piping hot pasta here.
and it was al dente.
so now it 's continuing to cook in there.
an i have the sauce that we already made and this little bit of hot pasta water.
so i 'm going to take this hot pasta water and i 'm going to poor about half of it right into my egg and cheese mixture just like this, and i 'm tempering the eggs, water.
because when i put this sauce into my spaghetti i do n't want the eggs to scramble, and this is going to make a little extra creamy too.
so just about half of that is enough to warm it up a little bit.
so now whore it right into the pasta just like this look at that beautiful an creamy and then go ahead and toss it around, and.
now it looks a little bit wet right now, but that pasta is going to go an absorb a lot of this sauce.
so you 're just going to get everything really thoroughly coded.
so now i have a little bit of fresh parsley here.
so i 'm just going to go ahead and just chop this up real quick, and.
now we 're just going to play this so, get your serving bowl and go ahead and put that in there anna.
nice mound look at that with a beautiful pancetta in there, and.
now a few extra crates of freshly ground black pepper just right over the top just like that i also like to put a little bit of extra fresh parmesan cheese on there.
this is like a killer dish look at that, that 's gorgeous and then finish it off.
just a little bit of this fresh parsley and now it 's time to take a bite right in there, with all that pancetta.
that 's where i want to be look at that me, oh, garlic that smokey, pancetta pepper, the parmesan cheese for those few simple ingredients that you put into this dish it gives you a huge payoff.
