OK gentlemen, here 's the next step.
so you want to take your, your deep a pan here, and you want to fill it with water property, about, maybe half the way.
so now that i have my pan half full with filtered water or purified water then you want to go ahead and add about.
maybe a teaspoon of salt there be a little more want to add just a few dashes of.
cayenne , pepper like that, the chili powder, you want to add, probably about.
i 'd say two teaspoons worth at about two teaspoons of chili powder right there, but he 's doing a cumin now.
so while it 's getting ready to go to a boil.
we 're going to go ahead and get our meat cut.
so now i 'm going to take my needs and the reason.
i 'm cutting it.
i 'm not, i 'm just cutting it.
because i wanted to cook faster, if you 're going to be braising it for hours and, hours, and hours, which you will be doing.
but you want to pick up whatever is on there.
and you just want to basically credit and charles so here we go we.
gotta cut up in just these pieces and in four, it 's a very cheap cut of steak.
it 's very hard, but when we 're done brazing it 's going to be soft and yummy.
and the reason i advise you use the cheapest eight 'cause it 's not going to make a difference the fat will come out of this and fuse with the beef as well, when you braise it and reduce it.
but also it just does n't matter.
what type of steak and you can even do the same thing with chicken.
but today we 're doing steak.
OK , so find the cheapest date that you can then go with it, it 's not a problem all right, gentlemen, sewer water is starting to get hot.
it 's not fully boiling yet, so before it boils, we want to slowly gently put our meat into the water like that.
now we have our boil.
so we want to turn it down to simmer, i 'd say maybe a three, three and a half, depending on your stovetop.
even a four by just so it 's got a nice simmer going it 's boiling up that water.
you 're going to notice all the slime from the beef coming at the top.
see that before you do that you want to mix all your spices and make sure they 're completely in there, once it 's boiling, and then they 're going to rise to the top again when they write the top.
you just want to scrape off the sludge scrape off the sludge scrape off the sludge.
this , this is just me.
it 's good for the tacos are going to make.
but i 'm also going to make some flout does, or taquitos filling in burritos and other things.
it 's good, you can make a big batch put in the fridge store.
it away what we 're doing is, we 're infusing that beef with these juices flavor juices.
and we 're going to get this to reduce to where it becomes basically a thick sauce with the fat in the meat and the reduction everything else everything to come nicely together when we shred.
it 's going to be absolutely yummy, so far.
we 've been doing this for about i 'd say maybe thirty minutes.
we 're letting it slowly reduce that flavor is still infusing that meat.
it 's a long process.
if you do n't have patience for cooking you 're probably not going to enjoy making this recipe.
if you 're honest people like me who will take hours and hours to make something.
because the reward is.
so amazingly immense then you will do this and you will enjoy, but, please i ca n't stress enough follow the way, i say to do it with the ingredients.
i say and then if you want to change something, afterwards go ahead, but at least try it the way.
i have it first nothing worse than saying, i 'm going to cut a corner here and there and then saying, oh, it did n't turn out the way i wanted, just do it the way.
it 's written and then if you like it, do it again?
if you do n't like it, change something, alright.
so , i 'll see you in a bit, so where into our process here we 've been doing it for about maybe an hour, hour and a half.
i just covered up for a little bit, but you do n't really have to.
because the keys to get the reduction going and just take anything it 's off the side here.
'cause that is, your flavor and keep reducing all right gentlemen.
i 'll take a look there.
you go it 's all.
done look at that juice guitar nice that looks and use forks to break it up, breaks up like that look.
at how simple that is done.
this is your meat mixture.
i like to keep the juice here because you want to keep it moist, even want to try out also.
it will steam out a bit more.
so this will get a little thicker.
