what 's going on.
everybody i stepping away from what i normally do in my reviews on youtube.
i 'm actually going to take something for a friend of mine who asked me for my recipe on kimchi.
so i told them i would just make a quick youtube video about it and put it on you tube for him.
so i understand if you subscribe this could be a little bit different than what you 're used to seeing first of what you 're going to need, you 're going to need a large head of napa cabbage that napa cabbage could go by chinese cabbage.
but normally at the grocery store, it 's called napa cabbage.
pop it up into bite size, pieces.
and then you 're going to get three to four tablespoons of kosher salt or sea salt, you ca n't use regular salt.
otherwise it will kind of gum.
up and goop up at the top of the top of the jar.
when you let it set in the refrigerator for several days, and.
so basically what you 're going to do is you 're going to put that on it, layers, you 're going to mix it in really well, put some on put it in layers mix.
it up real good, again then do another layer and repeat, repeat.
that several times till you have the salt really mixed into the each.
hey , about an hour, after you 've chopped it up, and you 've let it set for awhile, you 'll notice that the fluid starts coming the moisture starts coming out of the napa cabbage, and once about one to two cups of fluid starts to accumulate the bottom of the bowl that 's when you 're going to be ready to rinse it out the cabbage will still be crisp.
but it 'll look wilted and became a little bit translucent if you as you rinse and drain the, the cabbage you 're gonna wanna drain it very, well, the second time and try to squeeze out as much of the fluid as you can on that second.
go ahead and get your green onions and your garlic ready.
i tend to cut the tips off of the bottom of my green onions, just might not be any really good reason to do.
that 's just something, something i saw my mom doing as i grew up when you chop the green peppers app, please, please chop them into small pieces.
and then when you mince your garlic again just to do a very fine mince on that garlic go ahead and take all your chopped green onions and garlic and throw him in the bowl with the cabbage in there and mix it up pretty well, i also forgot to mention throw in two or three teaspoons of sugar that will aid in the fermentation as well as add to the flavor.
once you have everything in your bowl, go ahead and grab.
i like to use one cup of red pepper powder or not powder.
but crushed or ground red, korean red pepper, and you could use different amounts just depending on what your tastes are there are some people do n't put any red pepper.
and they make the white kimchi.
but that 's not what we 're doing today.
so put to your taste.
what i 'd like to do is i put a little bit in there and mix it up.
and then i put a little bit more in there, and once you 've mixed in enough red pepper powder to get to your taste i kind of let it set for another five, ten minutes, kind of stir it up one more quick time and then put it in a jar.
once you put it in a jar you 're going to let it set, i like to let it sit out for a day or two at room temperature not outside in my kitchen, or somewhere like that before putting it in the fridge erator , really.
it 's just like, just like sauerkraut, the longer, longer you let it set out and ferment that 's going to have more of a sour taste, every time.
it 's more common that people let it sit out three to five days and really the benefit for this is.
there 's some incredible probiotics and extremely healthy and good, for you should google it and read about the probiotic benefits of eating kimchi that 's just one of the super foods.
it 's just tremendously helpful for you healthy for you and again.
that 's really it.
this is about how much one, one head of cabbage made and one head of napa cabbage made, made about a jar and a half of, of kimchi, and again i made this go for one of my friends who asked me for my kimchi recipe.
so i 'm not one of those people that really have precise measurements as you can kind of see in my video, i just kind of throw it in there.
kinda , kinda taste so appreciate you checking out this video, please like it if you like, it, that helps other people.
thank you very much and have a good day.
