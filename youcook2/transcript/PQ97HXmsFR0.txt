hi , everyone mean granny, are going to be cooking from my kitchen today, and we 're going to be making some fun and delicious food.
so , let 's go ahead and get started.
all right now for the filling, i 'm going to use precooked frozen jumbo shrimp, and i am just going to soak it in cold water until they are defrosted and what 's the shrimp.
we can go ahead and just strain them in a calendar.
an once the shrimp are drained, from the calendar i 'm just going to go ahead and take the tail.
zopf and then just chop them into rough pieces about a quarter of an inch thick like.
this , and once the pieces are chopped, we can go ahead and set them aside, the first thing that we want to do is go ahead and peele all of the skin off using a peeler like this, an once all of the skin is removed from your ginger you want to go ahead and grade it using a greater just like this, an once your ginger is, all grated, you can go ahead and set it aside, and what i want to do is first just cut about an inch off of the top of the dreams like.
so and then i just want to cutoff the root basis like that now.
what i want to do is i 'm just going to cut them into about quarter inches pieces like this, once the onions are cut, then we can set them aside, while we prepare our other ingredients now, the other part of my feeling is just going to be a broccoli slaw mix.
now this is broccoli carrots and red cabbage and it 's already pre chopped.
and it makes it so much easier to make the filling for our spring rolls now to the broccoli mix.
i 'm just going to add the peanut oil.
the grated ginger, the green onions chopped garlic now this chopped garlic, i actually buy in the grocery store, pre chop.
it actually just saves a lot of time and preparing your foods.
but you can use fresh garlic if you wish just two teaspoons of that about a teaspoon of ground coriander.
now i 'm using this moroccan, coriander.
then i got i think i got this at world market.
but i just want to put about a teaspoon of that, and then a teaspoon of five spice powder.
now five spice powder, you can usually find at most oriental grocery stores, and sometimes you might be able to find it in the ethnic section of your local grocery store.
so we just want a teaspoon of this, as well, then we want to add just a little bit of grated lime rind.
this is just the zest of the line.
so again, i 'm just going to hold this greater over my bone and just, just, just a little bit of this grated lime into my broccoli slaw, and the last thing that we want to add.
a , some salt now, i 'm using this pink himalayan salt that i 've actually had gotten and i just want to add about a half a teaspoon of that 's all and.
now i 'm just going to stir until everything is mixed up together.
and once the broccoli has microwaves for about one to two minutes.
and has become soft.
just a little bit, you just want to stir it around again just to make something ingredients.
and then we want to go ahead and add in the shrimp and then just start until the shrimp is combined into the mixture as well.
now to rap are spring rolls.
i 'm just going to add about three teaspoons of cornstarch mixed with a little bit of water and this is just going to make a paste.
so that we can seal are spring rolls.
thoroughly , i 'm just going to use these spring roll wrappers.
you can usually find them in the frozen section of most oriental grocery stores, had an placed the rappers on a plate, and you just want to take a little bit of the mixture and kind of put it in the center.
but more towards you like this, and you want to make sure to get some of the shrimp in the broccoli and then what we want to do is we just want to fold this over and then bring the sides in.
now sometimes if you get a little bit too much of the mixture it will start to poke out just trying to push it back in when you want to go ahead and fold the sides in and make sure they 're in there tightly.
because if there 's any holes you will get spits and spiders when you go to fry them and then you just want to slowly roll up like this, and then at the end you want to take some of that cornstarch mixture singer.
ann just rub it lightly.
and then close it to seal, and there is your finished roll.
and you can go ahead and place this on a baking sheet.
an what we 're going to do after, that is, we 're going to deep fry them.
it was easy so once all the spring rolls are wrapped.
we can go ahead and heat about two cups of peanut oil on high, an once the oil is hot about three hundred and fifty degrees.
you can go ahead and add in our roles.
and we just want to let him cook until they are brown an once they turn, golden brown in color, you can go ahead and remove them and place them on a plate lined with paper towels.
an once they are done cooking, then they 're ready to serve , enjoy.
