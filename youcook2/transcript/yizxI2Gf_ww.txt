i have very simple in very easy recipe of butter, naan anne, i 'm cooking this without any thunder or oven, so let 's get started.
for the non, we need all purpose flour salt to taste water to knead the dough sugar oil.
yogurt in east.
so here in a bowl i 'm going to put two and half cups of all purpose floor add one TSP sugar.
one to two teaspoon oil, and east we 're going to put it right into the floor and salt to taste in quarter cup of plain yogurt, at room temperature.
make sure it 's at room temperature.
now i 'm going to need the door using the kitchenaid stand mixer.
add a little water at a time and also make sure the water is little bit lukewarm.
it will help the dough rise faster, we want to make a soft dough softer than normal chapati atta.
now take the door out in a separate bowl and let it rise leave it for thirty to forty minutes in a warm place.
so , after thirty minutes, you can see the dough is almost double in the size.
and now we 're ready to prepare the non.
so greece your pumps with a little bit of oil to prevent the door from sticking and take a desired amount depending on how big or small you want the non to be, and.
now deep it in a loose floor.
and we 're going to roll it with the help of rolling pin sprinkle.
some lose flower if it 's sticking now.
he depend or griddle, and we 're going to put the non on the griddle in, keep it on, uh, medium heat.
cover it and let it cook for about two to three minutes now as you can see.
it 's a, it has a lot of bubbles, so it is popping up just fine now, the one side is done for the other side.
i 'm just going to flip it over the flame directly to keeping it a little bit above the flame so it does n't burn.
but puffs up right so keep flipping it over until it 's nicely done so the non is ready now.
top it off with the butter.
if you want to make a garlic.
naan , just bread, garlic paste and sprinkle.
some fresh coriander.
but for my butter, naan, i 'm just going to sprinkle some kasoori, methi for extra flavor, and here the non is ready enjoyed with your favorite curry.
