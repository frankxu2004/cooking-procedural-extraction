hi , it 's nice sunday morning, and i 've got a few of my friends coming over to my place.
so i 'm just going to cook off some nice crunchy vegan caesar salad for them.
so i 'm doing your vegan caesar salad.
the original recipes got anchovies and eggs in it.
i 'm going to do it without the end without the entries, so around seven at close of garlic so it 's just nice and crushed.
garlic now also solved over this, and just kind of mash it through, so we 're just chopping the garlic now.
are you some bacon munis, which is without the eggs, a lot of people do ask me what is vegan, and what is vegetarian the difference if you 're awake and you do n't even have dairy products?
so , some nice and vastly ground black pepper into this people, use a lot of red wine vinegar or red wine into this.
but i 'm just going to use a humble lemon juice there, really adds that sing to the salad, and then with some cheese or the best to go over this is parmesan too.
now i 'm just adding the cheese to it.
but as i was saying, if you 're strictly or vegan, you can always use a swear based cheese, which is non lactose i 've got a nice wisc.
so i 'm just mixing the dressing now.
nice and thick creamy if you feel it 's too thick you can add a bit more of lemon juice, or any.
vinegar , vinegar tends to thin down the dressing and addressing so a little bit more of choose into it lovely.
now the caesar dressing is ready going to have to be very particular about this.
because this is what is going to give the taste to a salad.
so let 's taste it first.
yummy as i would have wanted it.
what next caesar salad is complete without good croutons, or nice crunchy rustic bread, or you can use the regular white bread, or a slide, where you can use any loaf if you have a slightly older loaf.
i 'm using a burger bun which is as good as any loaf suggest slice into it here.
we go nice big chunks.
so no tiny stuff here.
nice and big rustic, croutons, and first let 's put this on and then a good dollop of butter into this.
now here if you slightly concerned about making it more healthy what you could do is you could sprinkles and olive oil pepper like i am doing here little bit solved here.
some garlic flakes, again, as i said, if you wish you can always bake them in the oven, you can this is some olive oil.
if you do n't want butter, but, you know, gives it that nutty crunchy taste.
so our with truffle butter and in fact, i 'm going to add a little bit, so there nicely crisp.
so my croutons are getting ready, for my dressing.
is already it ready.
now what is left is the main salad which i 'm going to use some red peppers.
some yellow peppers nicely diced almost done there.
let 's put this off.
so you can see this little garlic that i was talking about up, which is what we want nice and crispy golden brown, lovely at this to this, just slightly cook it in the same flavor that the garlic has given out.
but not too much.
you do n't want to lose the crunchiness, romain for the deep flavor and ice book for the nice bit of crunch.
so i 'm going to make SQL quantities of the romaine and iceberg.
you do n't need to really go delicate just with this off, same again here just rip this apart once again.
nice and crunchy large chunks, you got some nice romania now with eyes work the same thing.
there 's no need to use your knife.
my fingers are good enough so some nice and crunchy iceberg.
just one important tip, here.
if you 're using any kind of letters make sure it 's nicely washed because it 's raw, but the most important aspect is you drain it nicely.
otherwise , there 's going to be a lot of water in your lettuce, and that 's going to make a salad watery.
we do n't want that, so some nice lettuce.
now no access water unites sharing tomorrow 's underneath.
my palm, and you 're goes my life like this, OK, so you got this tomatoes into this, this few whole, maybe, yeah, so nicely chopped sweet basil leaves.
of course, this is not statue twenty minutes, not compulsive to add basil.
i like it because it gives a fresh feel and flavor to the salad, so we have got this year.
some black pepper into this, if you want it, a little bit spicy, you could always add bit of chili flakes to it.
may be a bit off the best photo?
it , it 's all your taste now, with addressing a little bit of the dressing inside not too much dressing whenever you add to a salad.
it got lemon juice.
it 's got some kind of activity so it.
what it does it, it makes you salad slightly built in and soft.
so dressing should be added absolutely at the last minute when almost you are ready to serve the salad.
so i 'm just going to pick it up nicely with my fingers, nice and light just place it in the center like this, do n't press the leaves too much?
you do n't want to sit down and then a lovely change.
tomorrow 's, some of them pick, pick, pick now with extra dressing.
just dollars so fit around there 's too much is going to make a salad watery, so now with the peppers and the cool tones.
here they go all over the top lovely, is n't looking amazing.
so tempting salads always if you make them look good and if you really get, good flavor in it, it 's a mean by itself and.
now the cheese that we have leftover goes on top lovely and the last bit of cracked pepper on the top.
now what i 've done is i 've just slightly thin down my dressing, you can do it with water and just the thing down dressing mamia, my caesar salad is ready.
i can just wait to dig into this.
i 've made my own if you guys want to make it, you know, how to do it, so then why the wait, please wireless.
