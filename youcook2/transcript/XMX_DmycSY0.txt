i 'm making a really super simple tomato soup that you will just blend up in your blender and then when you 're ready to heat and eat just put into a pot heated up for about ten minutes, and you 're good to go.
so let 's get started.
first thing you 're going to need is about four tomatoes.
i 've cut the tops out of mind just because they were a little bit, woody and hard.
but the softer your tomatoes are the better.
so if you 've got some line, your own in the fridge, and you thinking what am i going to do with these cities perfect.
so put those into the blender.
next you, gonna add two tablespoons of tomato paste.
so mine is n't organic.
tomato paste with no extra fees added just pure to model two cloves of garlic, two teaspoons of oregon, oh, droid oregon, oh.
but if you have fresh on hand, feel free to use it.
one teaspoon of coconut sugar.
we could also use some raw sugar or brown.
sugar , as well, quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon parallel and one teaspoon of onion powder.
next , add salt and pepper to taste.
i 'm adding half a teaspoon of celtic sea salt, and half a teaspoon of white paper OK, and finally two cups of vegetable broth and this is.
now ready to blend delete an will blame this for a good couple of minutes to get it very smooth and mixed through, OK, this is nothing blended through now.
so at this point, you could put it into a container and freeze it till your ready to heat it in, eat it.
but today, i 'm going to serve this treadway.
so i 'll just be pouring it into a plot.
and then all you need to do is bring it to a boil and then simmer for about ten minutes, with the leader on, and then you 'll be ready to go OK.
so i 'm just putting this on to high heat and waiting till it comes to a boil.
OK , this is come to a boil now.
i 'm just going to turn it down to a sema.
take it off the heat citizen.
over , OK, i 'm going to cover that with the lead and let it simmer for about ten minutes.
and then it 's really to eat.
so this has been simmering for about ten minutes now.
and as you can see it 's going very rating color that nice rich tomado flavor in color has come through.
and that smells so good.
ca n't wait to have this for lunch today.
that looks awesome K five deserve this interval.
you 'll have about two big bold worth here.
so if you 're very hungry, you can eat the whole like yourself, or you can share it with someone else.
so i like to distribute all a little bit of non dairy milk on top.
but totally optional, after a little bit of fresh coriander here that i 'm going to put in here as well that he can put basil, you could put any herbs that you like i just let the taste of the coriander with the cinnamon and component combines.
