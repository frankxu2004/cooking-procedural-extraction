hi , i 'm rockin robin from cooking mexican, recipes dot com and today.
i 'm making soft tacos now.
one of the nice things about soft tacos is that when you bite into it a lot of times it will happen if you have a hard shell.
is it will crack and all your ingredients fall over the place, well with soft tacos that does n't happen.
so that 's what we 're going to make today.
so for this recipe, we 're going to use a pound and a half of ground , beef?
i have one yellow onion finely chopped.
i have one cup of tomato sauce.
three tablespoons of oregano leaves two and a quarter teaspoons of ground cumin.
i have three clothes of minced garlic anna teaspoon and a half of salt.
we 're going to start with three tablespoons of oil in frying pan now.
my recipe calls for vegetable oil.
but today, i 'm using olive oil and that works, just fine, too.
i 'm in a place, my onion into the frying pan with a saute.
the onions for four to five minutes until they become translucent.
the onions are soft now.
so now i 'm going to add the ground beef alright.
so now i 'm going to add some salt.
we 're going to cook this until the meat is done.
the ground beef is just now finished and there 's little excess oil in there, so i 'm going to drain that out.
OK , so now i 'm going to add my minced garlic.
we 're going to saute the garlic for another three minutes to bring out the flavor.
OK , now we 're ready to add the last three ingredients or tomato sauce are oregano and our ground cumin.
get all mixed in and cook it for about five minutes.
and i 'll be ready to go for our tacos army has been simmering.
now for five to ten minutes, and it 's ready to go all the, all the flavors of melded together, and it 's very tasty.
and now we 're waiting for the oil.
i 'm going to start showing you how to do the soft taco portion of this recipe.
so , in order to make our soft taco shells.
i 've got about a quarter now maybe a half a cup of olive oil in my frying pan, oven.
heating it up over medium heat.
so i 'm going to take a tortilla piece of one and see how it 's bubbling up.
that 's what i 'm looking for.
so my oil is hot enough and ready to go.
public tortillas here with some tongs, and i 'm going to dip them in the, in the oil.
you can hear it sizzling up a little bit.
i want to make sure that the oil gets on both of the tortillas.
i 'm going to let them cook just a little bit, so they firm up, take him out training a little bit and put it on paper towels.
put another paper towel on top kind absorb.
the oil rover had it.
now we 're ready for ingredients.
i 've dipped my tortillas in the oil.
so now they 're softened and.
now i 'm going to put all the ingredients inside and make our tacos got the ground.
of course, i 've got some lettuce.

i 've got some sliced avocado tomato sour cream, and some salsa taken tortilla.
i 'm going to place it on my plate, and i 'm going to add some ground, beef a little lettuce.
tomato sprinkle of cheese.
why should avocado and a little bit of salsa.
now when we close it up, sometimes they do n't want to stay.
but the sour cream really helps to almost act like a glue and holds it together?
we need a little extra help you can stick a toothpick in there.
a little bit of lettuce underneath that to kind of hold it up.
