hi , it 's christy in their ad kitchen today.
i 'm going to make the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich.
it uses three different types of cheese and i 'm getting this out of our cream cheese cookbooks, so you can guess one of the ingredients is cream teas.
an it 's super easy to make.
but super delicious.
so let 's get started.
so you need about ten slices of an italian bread and you can buy it sliced i just like to buy it unsliced.
and i can cut it to the size.
i like and if you could tell this great a serrated bread knife makes it really easy to cut that bread now.
some people do n't like as much bread so it 'll easily cut thin slice.
it 'll easily cut a thick slice and this nice, sharp knife prevents you from smashing down.
you get a nice rounded bread slice with those sharp serrated teeth.
and we 're going to set this aside, 'cause.
i want to show you how to mix up the cheese, filling.
so in a bowl you 're going to take three ounce package of cream cheese, a half a cup of mayonnaise, a cup of shredded cheddar cheese, a cup of shredded mozzarella anna, half a teaspoon of garlic powder and about a fourth teaspoon of season salt.
this is new to rated cal.
we have burger and fry seasoning.
we have a barbecue seasoning.
we have some marinades.
and they 're all really tasty and good alright.
we 're just gonna mix this together, and it 's gonna.
get kind of pasty, which is, is good?
i guarantee you do n't be turned off by the meanings 'cause that 's what kind of.
holds it all together, and it gives it a rich flavor.
but that cream cheese and mozzarella, and cheddar they 're all gonna melt together.
so on five slices we 're going to spread this mixture.
it 's really easy to spread with this little party.
spreader spreads butter and jam.
it 's really great, to put out on your appetizer table or cheese.
and i like to put the slices out.
so you know, that you can evenly share the cheese all right now, we 're going to go in and tap these with our remaining slices, and we 're going to go over to R skillet.
and prime so now we 're going to take about two tablespoons of butter and put that on this skillet.
i will add are this is going to make a couple for now.
i like to cook that on medium, medium, high.
but you want to watch him once they start browning they 're going to go fast, so, once your sandwiches are brown on both sides i ready to serve cheese is all melted and ready to serve.
this is our short, are bread slicer?
her muffins and smaller breads like this, and that 's the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich.
