i touch a meatloaf like a judge.
most men, if they look good and smell good, and they 're easy.
i mid and this meatloaf looks good smells good and is really, really easy, and you 're going to love it so we 're going to start with preheat.
your oven to three fifty.
we 're going to line a large baking sheet with tinfoil like this, which i 've done and we 're going to start with garlic and onions.
but when i do it 's a little bit different.
is i saute the garlic and onions?
this is fantastic meatloaf, so i have a half cup of chopped onion.
one clove of garlic right here a quarter teaspoon of thyme, dried thyme leaves, and when you saute herbs like that, it brings out flavor is even more.
so about a teaspoon of olive oil into a small pan like this, a half cup of onion in here and that one clove of garlic that i put through the garlic press, and that quarter teaspoon of dried thyme leaves also goes in here OK.
so we 're going to saute this for about five minutes until it 's like even a little bit brown.
because this if you put, this in RA, it just wo n't be the same you 've got to saute it and cook until it 's nice and brown and by the way, this neat look was in my cookbook this recipe.
people say that was the best meatloaf they 've ever had.
it was the most popular recipe in my book, and it 's just really good.
there 's quite a few ingredients but you just kind of after this, you just dump everything in the bolts.
really easy so will give this about another four, four and a half minutes, and will start to put it all together, so, after about five minutes, it 's going to look like this nice and browned.
and that 's what you want, well, turn this off.
and we 're going to set this aside to cool, while we put all the other ingredients together and pretty much everything gets dumped into a bowl at this point except the meat that 's going to go in last.
so here 's my recipe.
it 's a half cup of quick oats into a big bowl.
it 's a third cup of milk.
i like to put the milk in second to kind of soak into those.
a little bit third cup of milk and over here we have a quarter cup of finely chopped carrot.
i kind of shred the carrot and then chop it up a little bit.
so it 's the a quarter cup of chopped carrot, a quarter cup of fresh parsley and these really, really makes such a difference.
it 's a quarter cup of green pepper and a quarter cup of red pepper.
these , the red peppers sweet the green peppers start it makes a great combination.
we 're also going to add a half cup of ketchup right here that goes in half cup ketchup, one egg a teaspoon of dijon, mustard.
hi , pre measured, already a half teaspoon of salt.
some fresh pepper.
and this is the only way to do pepper, OK and then we 're going to make this up.
see these colors this first of all the oats instead of bread or whatever the oats add fiber and healthy fiber to this meatloaf and great texture.
the peppers add antioxidants.
the green and red peppers.
onions and garlic are very healthy.
so there 's really a lot of great health benefits to this.
that 's all stirred up.
now we 're going to do is put in the cooled onions and the ground beef so the onions go in onions and garlic and thyme.
and this is going to be.
i think i better put on some gloves for this.
it 's one and a half pounds of ground, beef.
and by the way, i 've done this with ground bison buffalo, which is very lean, and no hormones or anything.
it 's really good.
you ca n't even tell the difference, but this is one and a half pounds of the leanest ground beef.
i get this one.
i think has maybe nine percent fat.
so that goes in and now, i 'm going to switch to my gloves, and we 're going to mix this all up now, you want to get mixed.
but not over mix it.
so kind of fold from underneath and gesture it enough, so it 's all incorporated, but do n't overdo it.
because then it wo n't be quite a soft after it 's done.
this just takes it, you know, maybe fifteen or twenty turns OK.
that 's it now.
it 's time to put it on to that foil lined baking sheet that we did which is right here.
and we 're going to shape it into a loaf.
i just kind of dump it on there and shape it into about a five by nine inch loaf.
and there 's a reason why i 'm using the foil lined sheet and not a loaf pan, you 'll see when this is done.
the fat is going to drain away from this loaf, making it very, very lean 'cause when you use a loaf pan, the fat stays in the meat and that 's the fact that you do n't want.
there 's a little olive oil in there, there 's lots of flavor.
you do n't need any of that saturated fat to make this really, really delicious.
so , i think that 's it.
try to make it about even.
now this is going to go into the preheated three hundred fifty degree oven and the best the safest way to cook it is to know that it 's a hundred and sixty degrees inside.
so what i do is i put a thermometer in this is one of those instant read thermometers you can test.
it later on, when it 's done, but i have one that, that will continue to read.
so i put it in the center of the meat like that, and then i put it in my oven, and this end stays out to tie on to the.
i 'll show you in a second.
this goes into the oven for one hour at three hundred and fifty and then i have this thermometer that i plug this into which i do n't know, if you can see and then that will tell me when it reaches the temperature.
but again you can test this with an hour is pretty much it anyway.
but you can test it with an instant read thermometer and after an hour wait till you see how beautiful, this all browned on the outside fantastic, one hour OK the thermometer says it 's one sixty degrees and it 's all done, and it 's absolutely beautiful look at this here we pull up food thermometer here look at this awesome see look at that see that fat that 's drained away that 's all that saturated fat that causes heart disease you do n't need that.
so that 's why you do it on the sheet with the foil like that it 's browned on all sides the end cut is the best part.
but you do have to let it rest for ten minutes before you eat it.
so you have to just be patient.
but when you try it, if you do n't think this is the best meatloaf you have ever had.
maybe you should take your meatloaf.
