i 've got here the two duck breasts ready to go there for this marinade.
i 've got her some oyster source.
it 's got oyster extracts in it as well.
and in a lot of chinese recipes or marinades noise source is used with meat.
i need two tablespoons of shushing rice wine.
and , this is going to give the lovely bittersweet edge.
i want some light soy sauce.
two tablespoons in there, some fragrance aromatic chinese five spice and that 's got to the flavors of stitch and becker call, and it 's got a stony, cinnamon fennel.

now for some aromatics star, nissan cinnamon bark, go in two tablespoons of costa sugar, two tablespoons of running honey all that goes in there and the different sources, me, lovely and sticky and sweet.
