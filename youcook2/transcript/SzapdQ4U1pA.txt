today , i 'm going to show you how to make a pork with fried rice.
that 's the piggly old, friendly or prime old if you 're on a carb reducing diet this uses calla flower that 's minced or shredded to resemble rice instead of the rice i find it best to assemble their gradients ahead of time.
so you 're just ready to go.
so we 've got right here five hundred grams or one pound of pork cut into bite size.
chunks you can use other meat if you want to that 's fine here.
i 've got half a cup of soy sauce.
do you want to keep it truly?
pale ale, you could use coconut aminos.
i just do n't happen to have any.
so i 'm using those to make choices.
i 've got a half a cup of water.
two tablespoons of olive oil here.
i 've got two tablespoons, each of minced ginger and garlic.
this is a quarter head of cabbage that 's been cut into shreds.
two carrots peeled and cut into small pieces.
one green pepper cut into strips about a quarter inch.
this is one head of cauliflower, and i put it through my food processor to sort of turn it into a small grains like rice, you could use a hand greater if you wanted to and if you have any other spare vegetables laying around you want to use up here.
i 've got a little bit of frozen broccoli and snow pea pods.
i 'm going to throw in there as well, but zucchini or whatever vegetables, you 've got laying around is fine.
also got one medium onion diced.
you can use frozen or chop it yourself and lastly for eggs.
i 'm using an electric wok.
if you do n't have one, you can use a stovetop walk or a big frying pan.
whatever you 've got is fine.
you want to have something with the cover though, so first.
i 'm going to put.
i 've got the walk already hot.
so i 'm going to put the oil in, and the minced garlic, and ginger how that pans already got right away then with the meat in a few minutes just to brown the meat.
we do n't want to take it all the way through 'cause it 's going to be cooking for longer with the vegetables as well nearly there FM stir frying and keep stirring it pretty much throughout the process.
anytime you see any pieces that still have some pink bottom.
just sort of flip them over to make sure they get browned on all sides again.
you 're not going to cook it all the way, through, but you do n't want to have any rockslides on the meat.
left so just keep stirring it and looking.
for , under foot fits that one there and just flip it over so the paint sites, down, so that 's looking pretty good.
LOL , looks like it 's a little bit browned on each side, so i 'm going to start with can soy sauce or coconut aminos.
if you 're using that, or that impressed, we just want to give that a minute.
then i 'll sort of help get all the bits off the bottom and everything.
just sort of stared that for minute and get push any bits of garlic and ginger down in there, so it stays in your sauce.
that 's where a lot of the flavor comes from so.
now we 're going to put in all the other vegetables and this is the fake rice which we just made from cotton flower again.
and then the water stir it all up as best you can.
it 's pretty full, but it will cook down a bit as we go.
and i want to turn your heat down a little bit, 'cause we 're going to cover it then and simmer it stirring periodically for about ten minutes.
now we 're just going to cover that and remember to come back and stir it every few minutes, timer for about ten minutes.
yes , it 's been ten minutes.
i 've been stirring periodically.
see it 's reduced the ball to get there.
what you going to do.
now is turn the heat up a bit and just click it a few more minutes that will help reduce the liquid a little bit.
also , you want to check just the vegetables are is tenders.
you want them to be.
i 've just push the veggies after the side here.
and we 're going to pour your eggs directly into that liquid.
now you can just did n't stir it right away.
if you want stir it all through everything and it 'll just sort of thicken your sauce up and you wo n't notice much egg there, or you could try to let it cook a bit and get some chunks of egg in there, if you like whichever works for you, you 're going to kind of poaching that liquid for a moment anyway.
so as you can see as i push it around a little bit here and there were getting some bits of quick dig in there and the rest is just going to sort of blend into the sauce.
so go ahead and stir it up and from this point you want to keep stirring and cooking for a couple of minutes to thoroughly cook fettig, and i had it blend through with your liquids.
so that you can see most of our liquid is.
the egg sort of cooked into it and picking it up a bit.
you can see little bits of egg here and there, if you preferred you could always scramble your eggs ahead of time and throw him in.
but you 're going to have a lot more sauce.
that way this way it 's sort of thickens and helps create the sauce.
so you only need to go like a couple of minutes just to make sure that it is booked.
and it 's pretty much done so there.
it is something that 's pretty decent size.
serve you 'll get four to six service, depending on how large your servings are enjoy.
it 's really good.
