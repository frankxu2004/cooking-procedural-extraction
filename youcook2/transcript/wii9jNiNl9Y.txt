served hot or cold have a lot of versatility, so let 's get started.
what i have here is some cultivated mushrooms.
different wild mushrooms cultivated, should talky oyster mushrooms?
these , you can grow, right in your backyard on a board with the right soil.
so and also mostly available in most supermarkets and stores in america, how, 'bout little medium heat first question do you think the kids you could kind of put it on it and they would think that it was something like regular spaghetti they think they would think it 's spaghetti for sure you could, you could disguise it, you could disguise it.
but you would n't have to.
because they 're really that delicious.
now with him, he anartia, talky mushrooms inside of our skillet.
now you 're going to notice that like mushrooms are mostly all water.
so they 're going to suck up.
whatever oil you put in there they 're going to suck that up.
so we want to start cooking with that, and i 'm going to turn the heat on high, what kind of oil is that this is a vegetable oil you could use canola, you could use olive oil now.
here 's what we 're going to do.
we 're going to make a quick little dressing for this dish, so gluten free soy sauce.
OK , this is a oyster source which is has a pretty high sodium content.
so we 're just going to use a little bit of this for really for like a salt.
then we 're going to have a pinch of raw sugar.
the next ingredient is ponzu, which is sort of a lime flavored soy sauce really, really good.
any of you eat fish pond zoo on fish.
now i 'll tell you another great ingredient, and this is me.
so this is a read me, so, which is made from soybeans.
so we 're going to add that paste in here and is all that is that a spicy flavor to me so.
but no, no, it 's a pretty neutral and then we 're going to have a little socket that really depends if you are into soccer.
so now what we 're going to do is exactly.
so we 're going to just dissolve that up and.
now let me show you how quickly this is going to go.
now i have red pepper and onions that 's the.
next ingredient as, you know, bell peppers especially red pepper have more vitamin C in AM, then in orange, and you could see how it 's really soaked up all of the oil that 's OK, do n't have to panic just add a touch more oil it 's really no big deal.
now we 're going to add a little bit flavoring in here and then we 're going to put this dish show you how fast is ginger garlic a little bit of green onion sometimes people would love to just take a little bit of green onion and just kind of do 'em in pieces like this in a lot of asian cooking they 'll just cut him in big pieces like this, whatever you want to do, if they want to do that, that 's great, will add those in here i will get off flavors altogether, he smell out already, yeah, smells great is there a protein in one of the things i find.
so hard about being a vegetarian finding the protein sources i do eat fish.
but finding which combinations work the biggest thing that you could do right.
now is this is a perfect dish if you want to put tofu in it yeah, absolutely a perfect writer telephone you could fry it, you could put it right inside i 'd use a medium to firm tofu now, here 's what we 're going to do we 're going to add this really quick watch our source mixtures going to go inside were going to take out who.
don noodles lightly stir fry.
this just lightly stir fry.
it are the noodles sticking it out in the noodles are a little bit sticky.
are there already?
i just blanch them so just like spaghetti to al dente.
now we 're just going to let this cook.
do salt now if we want to get spicy now watch this, this is hydroponic, watercress and watercress is just been forgotten about?
so we 're going to cut it off its roots.
we 're going to add a little bit of this like a salad almost too the tray.
now , what we 're going to do is we 're going to take our put on.
and we 're going to bring this baby right to the platter now, and we 're going to just sort of lay this right on the platter.
and it 's going to work toward across the little.
she will just kind of straight down.
now what we 're going to do also to that is very simple.
we 're going to add a little bit of carrot.
we 're going to add a little bit of green onion.
we 're going to add a little bit of cilantro, which is going to add some great flavor to this, and then we 'll take a little bit more of our water.
just kind of cut, cut it right from, right from the earth, look at that there 's our first meatless, meatless, meatless dish.
