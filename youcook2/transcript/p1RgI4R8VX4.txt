why do n't you share that traditional restaurant style mutton rogan josh?
although kashmiri metal rogan josh is something with the kashmiri spoke with great passion, and is not what is served in the restaurants might do in restaurants.
we have a recipe which whole ships across the world have kind of tampered the way.
i am doing it today is one of the best selling restaurant recipes of sanjeev, kapoor 's restaurants and that 's where i 'm working for.
he 's my mentor also from home learned a lot of good things here.
is the beautiful recipe oil is what we 've got some whole spices?
cinnamon clubs five two six clubs.
big cardamom bay leaf, two of them, all into this oil is nice and hot onions equal quantity of onions.
if you 're using one cagey apart and you need to use one cagey of sliced onions and that 's a very important part of the recipe, and you need to brown this onions.
so , while this onions get ground that we also share with you.
what exactly a kashmiri, rogan josh is another was us, as the cooks of kashmir and known.
there was and was once did a very passionate about cooking meat traditionally in kashmir ingredient called rotten job, which gives a beautiful red color to the mutton roma.
just an, it 's cooked in mustard oil.
mind you with a lot of asafetida.
the keep hitting the mustard oil and keep adding the ass for cedar and the fennel powder.
first report, they add the button.
so , as avoided a anfernee powder, and then they might.
and , and the ginger garlic paste are added in kashmiri, rogan juice, and it 's very, very dry unlike what we see in restaurants, in restaurants.
nice red tape, beautiful rich gravy, made out of buttons.
stop ann martin cooked in it with kashmiri chili 's and that 's what i 'm sharing with you today.
lot of people on the internet have requested me that why do n't you share one of your traditional mutton rogan joyce.
recipes this is what i 'm doing, the onions are.
now midway to browning keeps turning in between.
so that they get evenly colored and you need to be watchful, not onions need to be just trump and not be browned.
because if they have ground more than what is required to get a burnt flavor.
so golden brown is the color and you need to keep stirring continuously to get that color, also, the only formally and it 's also very important that when you do dishes like this, and you want the onions to be brown the onions need to be sliced finally, and when it is sliced finally, which means we need to have a good sharp knife be careful about your fingers there the onions.
now as you see are nice and test from the color that i require an at this point of time, the onions are nice and sweet.
so we need to quickly add ginger garlic paste the garlic paste, one tablespoon and the ginger paste one tablespoon of this through this i 'm going to add my mutton.
i 'll praise the model for some time for about two to three minutes till the time.
it 's evenly colored and then we 'll add some water and cook until the button is nice and soft in the restaurant style.
mutton roman juice, that i do i keep it plain and simple, very less spices.
the gravy needs to be nice and rich, instead of water.
you could add stock if you 're cooking, in your restaurants, you know, the stock could be off trotters or chicken bones.
the button, as you see is.
now little brown do.
now is add some water since i do n't have stock at this point of time, and even at homes.
i 'm sure we all do n't use modern stock so water enough to cook the button at this point of time, i 'll add some salt also.
taste as much as you require give a gentle store.
what you need to do is cover and cook until they mutton is softap.
which is almost more than eighty percent of the microscope then we will add the rest of the ingredients.
so what i 'm going to do cover and cook.
this would take about twenty to twenty five minutes.
and martin would be just about done, and that 's the time we will add the rest of the spices so there is now check the button.
brown onions have given a good color to the gravy, the mutton is almost there now so let us add the spices.
i keep it very simple when i cook mutton rogan juice in my restaurant and i 've got a great trick that i do in my restaurants.
i use kashmiri chili powder, and i add water first before adding it to the gravy directly.
i never added directly cause, you know, scientifically, it said all the oils get blended with the water.
but they 're not spicy.
hot one of them is kashmiri chili powder.
the other one that i know is paid key.
chili does not add too much of spice but adds a lot of color here.
of course it 's the gravy that is getting coped.
but if you were to add the chili 's directly they would get burned very important to mix it with little water and that 's the trick into the rogan josh mice, red color i 've got some fennel powder.
half a teaspoon i 've also got some ginger powder half a teaspoon of ginger powder mix.
thoroughly , you see, the nice red color that 's coming.
that 's come through the actually that i 've used suddenly the color has erupted in the rogan josh.
beautiful color finally some risk, yogurt, half a cup of west yogurt.
i do not add tomatoes at all in my dream, and button rogan josh, in my restaurants sells like hot cakes.
and this is what the trick is.
i also prefer straining the gravy after cooking the button.
it gives a nice good shame to the gravy on that beautiful shine.
but if you are cooking at home, never mind you could serve a directly like this to your guests, so let 's cook this for ten more minutes.
it would be nice and thick ten minutes of cooking along with the yogurt and spices.
button is now ready to be served water, bowl.
here see the color beautiful color, you get from kashmiri chili there, abused bottomless, cope the best thing of cooking or martynas.
it should be battery, and if it is not cooked, well, then you never enjoy it.
the place that i have learned, my food from hydra, bod.
people always say that should be able to choose the model.
but in lucknow, they say, the buttons should be softened butter so in india.
all over people have different sayings and vicious.
but i feel button should be buttery in aerogal doors, nice and soft mutton rogan, joes for billions of my users who are being searching for this recipe, and have requested this recipe number of times.
that 's why i thought best to share this recipe with all this is how we cook in our restaurants.
you try in your restaurants, or at your home and enjoy this with long grain.
basmati rice or a code within our perrotta, beautiful, modern avengers.
