so check this out.
we 've got one kilo of diced lamb.
one coarsely chopped onion four tablespoons of white vinegar and four tablespoons of brown vinegar.
ten cloves of garlic and an inch of ginger, which i 've just chop to you guys.
now is common to have the same amount of garlic and ginger in a vindaloo.
but i like it better this way.
i 've done a bit of experimenting with this here.
i 've gotta spice mix now, that is, a bit going on here.
so rather than mention all of the ingredients i 'll put them down in the description bar for simplicity reasons.
so just check that out.
we 've got some gay here, of course, you can use butter or some olive oil.
if you want a tablespoon of brown sugar, half a tablespoon of salt two teaspoons of paprika and two four hundred gram cans of diced tomatoes.
now going to start.
he bought blending up the spice mix.
now i 'm using the spa splendor.
but you can use a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder.
if you like for this and grant it until it 's fine now into a blender.
i 'm going to add all of these ingredients, so the garlic and ginger onions now this is a little bit of an unorthodox way to do it.
a lot of people will brown the onions or first and do it, like that.
but this way you get all the flavor combined into the source and i think a vindaloo is pretty much all about the source guys for those vindaloo heads out there, you know, what i mean.
so we 're just adding in everything other than the lamb and blend well, and if you want to chunkier source, simply add the tomatoes in later.
now headed up a pot over some charcoal of melted the guy, and just editing that lamb, which i 'm going to lightly brown before pouring in that source i 'm going to put the pot lid on and leave it for a few minutes to come up to a simmer once simmering just give it a lot.
stir replace the lid and move it off the direct heat.
now this will keep simmering throughout the cooking process without burning the bottom.
and after a narrow.
so give it a quick stir, and i 'm going to replace the lid on the cattle only this will cook the source down and help it reduce, and we 're going to do that for another half an hour until the source is nice and thick.
this is what we 're looking for, he guys.
and , that is, if you 're done, serve with some rice cause.
give this ago it is one of my favourites.
you 've gotta check this out thanks for watching and i 'll catch you guys next time.
