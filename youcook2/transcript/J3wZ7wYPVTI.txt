hey guys, many of you have been asking me for more vegetarian recipes.
so i thought i would share with you.
one of my favorite appetizer ideas homemade hummus, hummus is one of those things that is always going to take better homemade.
and when you see how quick and easy, it comes together, you 're going to be making it all the time.
let me show you how to make the first thing we 're going to do is.
rinse , are chickpeas now you may also know these as garbanzo beans so it 's the same thing so go ahead and drain them into a strainer?
give him a rinse and just rinse them off now for our garnish.
we 're going to want to make sure that we take at least about a tablespoon of chick peas and put them on the side were going to tough are hose with them after there done.
so you want to make sure you set those aside, and we 're going to take arctic piece and put them in a food processor.
so for me, the mark of a great tasting clinic is a smooth and creamy, hummus and a food processor.
is really going to help with that, so go ahead and give them a world?
you just want to make sure that they are nice and sort of cut up.
they do n't need to be completely pureed at this stage.
we just want to give them a head start.
then we 're going to add half a cup of water puree that again we 're just trying to get those chickpeas.
nice and smooth next, we 're going to add some to him about two thirds.
cup , now if you 're not familiar with tahini it is a delicious sesame E paste.
you find it in the aisle next to the peanut butter.
now if you 've never worked with it before, and you open your jar do n't be startled if you see a bunch of oil on top that 's actually what happens to tahini when it sits for awhile.
you could just go in with your night and give it a stir, and you will re, incorporate all of that oil back into the sesame E paste.
then , we 're also going to add half a cup of lemon juice, then you 're going to add two garlic cloves.
one and a half teaspoons of salt and two teaspoons of human.
i love the cumin because it adds a really wonderful sort of exotic taste to the hood.
pop the top on our food processor and give it a world for at least two to three minutes.
you cannot process, it too long.
we really looking for a smooth and creamy, hummus and that just takes some time in the food processor.
so not to worry, just, sit back and let it world, then at this point we 're going to slowly add half a cup of olive oil you could do this with the machine running and just pour it into the shoot.
and you 'll see that, that homeless will become free.
near and smoother as you add the oil now at this stage.
you want to check your hunts now depending on how you like it, it 's really personal preference.
if you like a weightier home as your host could be done.
if you like one that 's more spreadable you probably want to add about two tablespoons more off, liquid, and at this point, the choice is yours.
you like really tangy, hummus with a lot of lemon juice, you could add two tablespoons of lemon juice that 's normally what i do 'cause.
i do like the lemon juice.
or you could add two tablespoons of water or two tablespoons more of a choice is yours.
at this point you want to transfer your harness to a goal.
i like to spread it with a spatula because then you 'll get some nice texture in your home.
you 're going to wrestle with a little bit more olive oil on top sprinkle with some cumin top with some chopped flat leaf parsley, and then we 're going to add our remaining chick peas on top and you 'll see.
you have a beautiful, looking for this.
now at this point you could serve your hummus with some pita chips, a bagel tips that i really like to serve it with some grilled pita bread.
now you could just heat it up in the microwave or the oven.
but i do think reeling it really kicks it up A notch.
then you 're going to really either on about a queue or an indoor grill on both sides.
and then you can cut it into triangles, then to serve.
i really love to serve hummus like this in the summer time on a big cutting board, and i am a big fan of the blues.
i recently saw that they had this walnut style.
and i just loved it.
and it makes for a great chopping block.
but it also makes for a great serving piece.
