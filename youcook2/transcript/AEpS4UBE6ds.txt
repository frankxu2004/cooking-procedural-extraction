hello , everyone marquee.
welcome to a thousand simple recipes.
today , we 're going to do the eyes and sandwich.
the spring roll now the spring rolls famous.
all i verizon is a fantastic fast food.
you can either make them cooked or uncooked and today.
i 'm going to do the cook version with chicken and vegetables, so let 's go for it.
as always, guys, we 've got the ingredient list, and the recipe written below in the description box.
the great thing about this method of making a spring roll as that.
the sources basically inside this spring roll.
so what i 'm going to do is just make the source that 's going to go into the chicken and vegetable mix inside.
so we 've got one tablespoon of mirror.
there , we 've got the tablespoon of soy.
we 've got a tablespoon of sugar.
we kind of put about half a tablespoon sesame E oil, some chicken broth, four tablespoons.
an one tablespoon of cornflour so that 's what it looks like when it 's finished so here.
we are cooking the filling up just got a couple of tablespoons of peanut oil in there and just going to fry that ginger up to start with on a hot pain and i 've got some chicken which we finely chopped one breast and that will the try that for about twenty seconds.
so we just, just keep that moving once that 's starting to merge is going to try it for too long.
i just wanna little bit of color off it and then i 'm going to add my vegetables.
so that 's about and ask and then we, gonna, add the carrots.
the tabs attempt, and do nothing.
and they just well, i got up.
can you just want to get these just so they just, quote, hello, business just starting to look like the chickens gone right now?
so we 'll just get the brockton now.
the source that we made up earlier and that should be picking up the source nicely.
you just want to wait until the vegetables in and the source starts to take a nap as you can see now.
this source, in there is just starting to get a bit of thickness to it, so here i 'm just peeling off the rappers.
and you just want to do as many as you 're going to make an keep them in a damp cloth 'cause you do n't want to let them dry out otherwise they crack and become hard to roll.
so i 'm going to do about twelve here.
so that 's it so the chicken and vegetable mixture is cooled down.
so i 'm just going to add some rice.
vermicelli , that are just are soaked in water for about forty minutes, and then put straight into some hot water for about fifteen twenty seconds.
and that 's all until they become tender.
and then chopped it into three or four inch paces, and i 'm just going to add that coriander two now, and this is pretty much are filling now, once we finish this week and start wrapping.
so this is our finish mix.
i 'm just going to check that for saltiness and just tasted and just needs a little bit more salt.
so i 'm just going to put a bit of salt in there, so here we are we just got the pastry diagonally facing towards us.
one of the secrets of making good spring arises not to overfill and just ca n't run put too much in an.
what you want to do is roll that one over first and then when you get to the half way mark, if rather that over, and that one over, and then i 'm using some egg white, here.
but you could use flour and water will work just as well too close up your spring RA, and we want to keep as tired as possible.
try and keep any air bubbles out, and now we have this ready to cook.
so we 're just going to add a couple of spring rolls are determine overfill.
your and you want to just keep turning these over, so, like cook evenly, and they, you want to cook for about six or seven minutes the oil temperature you do n't wanna have it too.
all you wanna, you wanted to cook graduate, so you get this really crispy outside skin, just going to take these spring rolls out.
now they look absolutely gorgeous.
beautiful , golden brown color.
and let them dry in that access.
oral off, so this is the chicken and vegetable spring, raw more japanese chinese style of spring roll.
but it 's delicious crunchy on the outside chicken and noodles and vegetables.
we really want that healthy version look at my other uncooked rice paper spring roll for the gluten free and people and still issues too.
but really that 's fantastic on going to enjoy a whole bowl of these.
very , whole ball of these.
i 'm going to sit down and eat them now, so i 'll see you next time on it thousand simple recipes.
