welcome to malaysia kitchen australia.
reporter , and i 'm here with our ambassador, alvin choir.
welcome alvin, good to see you again.
now tell me what are we cooking today.
we 're making a seafood locks are so from scratch.
yeah , yeah, it 's like really.
no , this is really easy.
all my stuff for all my recipes are really easy.
it 's all about getting the right balance.
the right ingredients, and you 're ready to go and, well, sees love, essay food.
so i 'm really looking forward to this, a seafood lacks am i getting you at great you guys.
let 's do it so we 're going to start not so today is a seafood lobster.
let 's start making the pace from scratch.
so we 've got some garlic and ginger.
so all it goes into the food processor.
we 've got some candlenuts here now that 's been soaking in water for a bit just to soften it a little bit.
now cannot sell really good for luck, says they give it that creaminess into it like we ca n't find cattle nuts, try harder.
but if you really ca n't find kendall nuts that you can use macadamias, well, so nice in australian, so we can actually add some.
we 're going to add some, so this is just roughly chop so they 're all just going to go in there some small birds eye.
so these are leaving the seeds on.
because we like spicy food.
so we 're going to check that we 've got some dried shrimp as well.
now dried shrimp again seafood lots and lots of paste itself is actually very it 's just an intense seafood paste.
so we 're going to add the dried stream.
we 're going to add some to make powder.
so this gives it that color about a teaspoon we 're going to add some lime rind.
this lovely sort of fresh citrusy flavor now vietnamese meant so we need a like a good bounce about a tablespoon.
now we got it at the shrimp paste.
now we only going to add one teaspoon.
we 're going to add the whole block now.
this , if you want to you can actually toast them fairly gently on the flame, so that gives it that extra set of toastiness.
but you do n't have to.
we 've also got some coriander powder also.
a teaspoon we 're going to add in.
i think that 's also we 're going to put a little bit of oil to lubricate it, and then we 're going to grind it all together, and that 's going to be our pace.
then , we can start making the latter.
so just found a tablespoon.
now i 'm going to start whizzing now, we 're just going to tip this prawn head in there.
but it smells nice instead of pointing that you can see it slowly changes color to this nice sort of orange is sort of gold sort of prawn oil and that 's what you want.
so there will be a lot of splattering.
so you 're a kid trying to set home food under adult supervision.
so that we 're all done with him and this is a great way if you do n't eat the heads, this is a great way to actually use it like it 's all we 're talking about sustainable, eating these days, and we want to use the beast from head to toe.
so why not use the print heads as well at the pace.
now that smelling really good, if you need to add a little bit more oil.
but this is fine for maine and once you get that lovely sort of fragrance, you can actually start adding a stop now, the stock that i 'm actually using it 's actually a combination of chicken stock and fish stock.
i love fish.
sock it actually gives it again.
it 's a seafood lobster, so go if it 's a chicken lobster then use all chicken stock.
but it 's a combination so it 's a total of one liter, so add them in.
so once it 's us to come to boil, you can actually add the coconut cream.
so will do that now.
this variations of lots, uh, so that 's like the health conscious lotzer.
which everyone uses light cream like the seventy percent less fat, like i love.
like what 's the point of having lots are when it 's going to be fat free.
you 're not going to eat this everyday unless you 're in malaysia.
trust me, we eat this for breakfast in god, is good.
so we 're going to bring that to boil as well, and then once that comes, to boil will start adding all the other ingredients.
so the prawns the fish balls, did tell food pass now?
is when the balancing sort of start.
so you want to taste it.
now if you tasted right.
now it 's going to be fairly it 's going to be fairly creamy and it 's going to be fairly, you know, kind of roll.
so it 's not ready yet.
so this is when you start adding little bits and pieces.
so you add by splashing a couple of drops of fish source when a couple of, you know, about a minute flashing.
so we can add a bit of sugar to flavor that and then we 're going to squeeze some lime juice in to speak sitting there.
so the idea is you want to find a balance.
so when you actually, flavoring you kind of need to sort of go OK that needs a bit more fish source.
so that needs to be more salt now, then we 're going to add the prawns in rado?
so , once that scene we 're going to add the bowls fish bowls, and the tofu puff as well, so we 're ready to play it up.
that 's sort of nice and percolating away.
so we 've got our lovely bola , vermicelli.
here we 're going to top.
it , with a little bit of being sprouts and then we 're going to start scooping all these lovely look at that.
so i want to start with maybe some tofu pastor.
will just put it there so have some fish balls.
as , well, even a couple of problems and then we 're going to spoon the soup over that.
now then top it with a little bit of career in a shallots and if you do want for bit.
more contrast, we can add a bit more in his brows, so there you go.
how easy is that seafood lots are alvin style.
i followed my nose and look what i found always ready for the taste.
