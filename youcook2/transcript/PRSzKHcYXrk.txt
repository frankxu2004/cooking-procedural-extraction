our , any chef book here in today.
we 're going to bake up some falafel.
what 's a falafel, falafel is just chickpeas.
it 's just garbanzo beans.
it 's a fried fritter of garbanzo bean, but we 're not making a fritter 'cause we 're not frying.
we 're doing it because it 's easier, you know, it 's a less of a pain.
that 's why i 'm using the can 'cause.
it 's less of a pain.
i 'm going to drain it, and i 'm going to rent it.
one can of garbanzo beans and then most everything is going to go in a food processor.
my hands are not frequently large.
it 's just the angle of the camera for the beans in there.
and then i 'm going to go ahead and throw some onion and three cloves of garlic.
but , you know, just put two if you 're not a garlic lover like i am 'cause that 's very garlicky.
if you put three and then i 'm going to put in my spices and corey anderson cumans and cayenne pepper little.
baking powder so to solve the cayenne peppers optional, you know, if you 're not interested in the heat, do n't use it?
but if you ca n't stand the heat get out of the kitchen as they say some cilantro and parsley fresh quarter.
and then i 'm going to top it with the rest of the beans from the can, you know, this is still just the same can i just like to put him on top.
so my spices and stuff do n't stick to the top of the process because so i got this little rinky, dink one that i make homeless in.
and i 'm not going to process it for very long, you know, just a quick little grind, grind then beat the machine and say bad machine.
so the machine knows.
that 's been bad.
and then i 'm going to look at it, see i 'm looking at it right now and it 's not enough.
so i 'm going to push it down.
and i 'm going to pulse it one more time just for a second 'cause you do n't want to over process this stuff.
sorry , it you 're not going to liquefy it, you know, you wanted to have a lot of texture and you know, the beans are soft already 'cause they come out of it.
can , you know, they 're going to stick together just fine?
plus we 're going to throw a little breadcrumb in there, anyway.
just that itsy, bitsy, teeny, weeny bit, so go ahead and get your mixture process.
throw it in a bowl.
and then we 'll go ahead.
and put a tablespoon of bread crumbs or flower and then we 're ready we 're almost ready to put on a show.
we 're going to put in some lemon juice to which you do n't have to do.
sometimes i put images is not going to be the end of the world, either which way in this case, though it kind of, i think a liquefied in a little bit more.
so that it was n't his drug.
so you know, just kind of gauge that and whether or not you got a lemon.
now i 'm going to use a tablespoon and i 'm going to mount it on there each one of these is going to be about two tablespoons 'cause it 's a heaping, tablespoon that i 'm using to measure this i 'm going to get ten out of this king, which i usually get if you want you can just double up the size and make five.
but i make the, i 'd like to make the little rinky, dink ones that will go on a piece of pita bread sandwich, you know.
so there, you are n't i 'm sliding in the fridge, you know.
but they 're not gonna fall apart anyway.
so you do n't have to do that part before you write it cook them go ahead and drizzle or brush some olive oil on there, you know, i do n't have a brush 'cause we just moved into this place, and my brushes in florida, and i have n't bought a brush yet.
so i 'm doing this caveman style with my hands, you know, this is how meander calls used to put the olive oil under falafels years ago, sliding into an oven at four hundred degrees for twenty minutes, and then i 'm pulling it out, and then i 'm doing a flip flop, you know, just turning them over there.
not done yet.
and this is another reason you want him to be like these overinflated poker chip diskettes because they will get more service on the pan.
you 'll be able to get a little more color model, you know, they 'll be able to stay up a little bit better on the pain.
but give a flip boom back in the oven, at four hundred degrees.
still , for ten more minutes and then that will be it fateful up.
they , as good as fried falafel, no because they 're not fried.
but they are good.
and they 're easier to make you know, there D licious, you know, i love these things in a little piece out or on a plate, with some other stuff, which is how i 'm going to eat them and look at this here that crispy on the outside and watch this here boom nice and steamy wholesome goodness and freshness in there, and here 's the important part watch right here special effect finger looked at it still moist inside.
it 's not a dried out desiccated husk of a falafel juicy.
tasty shuffle, just like a fried falafel.
but not fried serving it up with ha miss, you know, cucumber tomato blah, blah, blah, you know, whatever you want to put in a pita sandwich you have n't if you have n't had falafel before super easy give it ago let me know what you think bone aperte thanks for watching i 'm going to go ahead and put this up to the homeless video.
because that 's that makes sense.
