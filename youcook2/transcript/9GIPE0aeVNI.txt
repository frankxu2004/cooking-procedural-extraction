hi , my name is arena from pastiche of cape cod and today, i 'm going to make a classic caesar salad.
so if you 've never made a caesar salad before we 're going to start with a raw egg nice fresh egg, i 'm going to take my whiskey and some nice olive oil.
i 'm going to beat that together that looks great, and i 'm going to take a nice fresh lemon and i 'm going to just take out some of the seas you can still going to get, i know there 's a trick it can use cheesecloth and seeds.
blah , blah, blah.
but i do n't.
i do n't have any cheese cloth, so i 'm just going to squeeze in the lemon.
i 'll pick up the seeds.
afterwards so next, i 'm going to put in some mustard a couple of blobs like that, maybe a little bit more i 'm going to add some westchester sauce.
some ground pepper, and i 'm going to also add a little bit of fresh, he saw take a nice really nice.
maybe you two cloves of fresh garlic you put that in there, now.
i 'm going to take the anchovies.
i have about three anchovies here.
i like the white anchovies are really great, but these are n't families.
are just a regular ones that you can get at the grocery store, and i just shred them with two forks?
you 're going to mix that all together looking really good.
already , can i like to take some fresh parmesan cheese and a greater?
and this will thicken it up even a little bit more almost done, then you 're going to take your romain course.
and if there 's any bad leaves just take a mafe and you 're just going to quote all the lettuce with that great caesar dressing.
take some grated parmesan cheese again fresh.
they did ahead of time and the last but not least we 're going to add some homemade croutons.
ann you 're all done excellent, ca n't wait to eat it.
