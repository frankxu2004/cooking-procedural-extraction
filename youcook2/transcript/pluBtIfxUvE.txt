blow , this is chef john from food wishes.
dia , comma, with lobster scrambled eggs.
hey , we 've all been there anyway all kidding, aside, you may, in fact, one day have leftover lobster and scrambled eggs is a fantastic way to use them up.
so what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to take a saute pan on medium low heat chunk of butter when the butter melts.
i 'm going to add my lobster chunks you 'll notice there 's still in fairly large pieces.
you do n't want to dice it or mess it up like i 've seen in some recipes.
you want to know you 're eating lobster.
so , do n't chop it up?
leave it nice big pieces as soon as that lobster starts to warm through.
it 's not really cooking.
it 's just starting to gently sizzle in the butter and the chills been taken off.
i 'm going to add my eggs to which have added a couple tablespoons of terragen, leaves one of my favorite, favorite seafood herbs lobster just a perfect, perfect pairing.
i 'm going to turn the heat up to medium and i 'm going to take a spatula.
i 'm obviously using a nonstick pan here.
i 'm going to keep it moving until it 's done.
are you gotta?
keep it moving.
i do n't want big chunks of rubbery scrambled eggs, and lobster.
i want this very, very, very soft and very, very custody.
now the only other times i 've made this i 've actually scrambled the eggs first, and then when they were almost done, i folded the lobster meat in which does work try something different, i wanted to start with the lobster in the pan, and i wanted to scramble the eggs with the lobster to possibly impart more lobster flavor into the dish the risk, of course is overcooking, the lobster, which i 'm happy to announce did not happen and again very important you keep it moving keep that spatula scraping against the bottom of the pan.
so that no part of the egg stays in one place, too long.
so i 'm going to keep it moving, keep it moving when it got to this point almost there i stopped why.
because by the time you put the spatula down, and you get your warm plate and you go ahead and you serve it up it continues to cook from the residual heat in the lobster and the eggs.
so if you think, OK, it 's almost where i want to stop put on the plate by the time you dig your fork in, it 's going to be absolutely perfect and there you go little bit of toast cup of coffee, and you are in breakfast heaven, we have a bunch of leftover lobster, hanging around i know, happens all the time.
you should give this a try super great way to use it up alright.
so i 'm going to dig in here, and you can see that custardy egg, just a beautiful sweet buttery, taste luxurious texture that little bit of anna set flavor from the terrigen kind of a licorice flavor profile just fantastic with this.
and , my theory about cooking the lobster with the eggs instead of adding at the end totally worked this really did have a stronger lobster flavor version.
i described really, really delicious.
i hope you give this a try check out food wishes dot com for all the ingrida mounts as usual, and as always enjoy.
