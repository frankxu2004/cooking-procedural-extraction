hey guys welcome to highly cooking, do n't you just love corndogs ideal?
today , we 're going to make homemade corn dogs with homemade batter, and we 're gonna homemade crime in our homemade deep fryer.
actually , a deep fryer that i bought.
but anyway, let 's do it, alright.
i 'm assembling the batter in here.
i have cornmeal flour baking soda big and thought.
baking salt baking powder and salt and then i 'm mixing my wet ingredients here.
the recipe calls for buttermilk.
i 'm sorry, but i put regular milk in and just added like a teaspoon of vinegar voila, lowdermilk.
now i 'm going to great third of a cup of onion.
little , but if you want little chunks you could use a bigger greater or you could die, sit with your knife, or you could put it in the blender, or you could put it in a bag, maybe and then hit it with a hammer, a bunch and pulverize it like the hulk would do.
i do n't know how effective the ID.
but it might be fun.
now this is not going to be one third of a cup by the time i 'm done 'cause it 's so amazingly mashed.
but that 's OK, because i know that, that hunk of onion that i cutoff was about a third of a cup north of onion and volume.
so will still get the same amount of onion flavor whatever put that in with my homemade buttermilk, and i 'm crying.
so good that, that little bit in there.
and then eight ounces of this, this is a fourteen ounce.
can so that means just a little bit more than half the, can i think you guys tell me if i 'm wrong?
'cause math is not my strong subject, just kidding, i was pretty good at math, OK, just combine that together.
and then will pour this into our big bowl of dry ingredients and whisk it together to combine.
you sounds gross.
here i go.
now you do n't mix it too much.
if there 's still some lumps, that 's OK, just get all the dry stuff from the bottom.
OK , this looks good on the set.
it aside to rest world.
my oil heats up in that ten minutes.
the corn, corn meal is going to absorb the liquid.
the batter is going to really thicken up a lot.
so it 's very important for thickening and also to soften the cornmeal, granules.
so you do n't get real gritty batter.
if it 's too thick when you 're done, you can add a little bit more milk will check out that out and right now.
i 'm going to get some dogs on some sticks and get some oil hot.
yeah , OK, we ready to make some corn dogs.
i got my fry.
daddy i gotta bunch of shortening i 'm going to put in here, you can use peanut oil.
but i personally like shortening because it 's easier to clean up.
and also i love trance, fats and heart disease.
just kidding, whatever it 's once a year.
i 'm not going to kill myself this way probably not this friday that i have only has one heat temperature on i have no.
i lost the manual.
so i do n't know, what temperature at fry 's at.
but fry 's to golden brown temperature that 's what i 'm talking about.
so this whole thing goes in here alright.
i put some paper down because i do n't want to get oil.
all over my fancy countertops that i just bought.
so you could put up normally output old towel down.
but i do n't know where that old towel went.
who wants to lick the canister.
OK , i 'm going to plug this bid in like so, and that 's going to start heating up right away and in the meantime, i have my dogs.
and i have them on a plate of cornmeal or cornstarch and that 's important that 's going to help the batter stick to them.
so you just want to like roam around the cornstarch, an then stab him with a stick like there, a vampire then stick this gently, gently do not want to puncture the sidewalls of the hot dog.
just keep going.
straight an easy, just easing it in just teasing it in using it in you should look at your hotdog when you 're doing this.
but i 'm a pro.
so i can look at the camera and do it, alright i 'm going to do a couple of these, while the oil heats up it 's already melting real good last insertion.
i should be a weiner surgeon.
OK , i 'm just going to get these all covered in lee M stuff.
so i lied a little bit too this is actually sweet rice flour 'cause i ran out of cornmeal.
but usually is cornmeal , but.
i 've tried this before, too.
and it works so.
give me a break.
either way i do n't really know what else to do is sweet rice flour besides users to make american corn dogs going to rinse my hands.
that 's heating up.
i 'm going to check the actually F rinsing my hands i love, we need you.
so my hands, let 's check.
the consistency, right this might be a team at thick but actually as i stirred it 's loosening up a little bit.
so i 'm going to not add any milk for now and try one.
and if the battery falls off then somebody else has to eat that one alright i remember that i have a deep fry thermometer so get your oil hot to three seventy five.
this is three seventy, but it 's been like that for awhile, so i give up close enough alright.
i 'm gonna dip, a dog.
so put it in like that and then use a spoon to sort of scoop the batter give it a little tural.
get it totally coated alright, i put a little spin and then put it in, there does twirl it around.
in there see.
it 's already getting my single the ground.
it gets real lumpy.
it 's not going to look like the ones that you get at the state fair, but it 's going to taste a hundred times better.
apparently i have.
one minute and that looks pretty beautifully brown to me.
i want to set it on that paper to drain on for a second.
all over it to me renta, boobs OK, perfect now.
i 'm going to eat this one that 's been cooling for a little while dip in my secret sauce.
i love corndogs, be careful if you give this to a small child, because there 's a stabby part in it so lesson.
learn kids be careful when you eat, you can make a rank on dogs because this is merica ha.
OK , i 'm gonna finish, eating my corn dog, but if you want the actual written down instructions you can check out hyla cooking dot com.
