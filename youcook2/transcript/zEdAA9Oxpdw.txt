hello , i am chef diane to mail and welcome to bootleg tips.
today , we 're making something very fun, generally.
this is something that you would brine.
but we 're doing it a very fast quick and easy way.
and what is that sauerkraut.
it 's a pickle and generally it 's based apon pudding something in some salt in water, not letting it ferment.
however , we do n't always have that time.
and we really want to good not store bought sauerkraut that we can make easily at home to match with anything, for instance.
maybe your ruben so make sure to check out my recipe.
so first what i 'm going to do and you want to make sure that you get it really fit when cabbage finally cooks it wilts down, contains a lot of water.
and that 's it now.
i 'm going to go straight to the soap saute.
it nat all my other ingredients so we 're going to have super delicious.
fabulous sauerkraut, my ipod is already nice and hot.
i 'm going to get my oil in there.
that 's a tad bit.
we do n't want really poorly sauerkraut.
we just want cook sauerkraut.
little oil goes a long way in a hot pan and let 's see, year baby.
in it goes, first i 'm going to let it wilt a little bit and then once it does, i 'm going to add some vinegar.
let it reduce.
and my sugar, my mustard seat, in a little bit of salt cook it down and that 's about it we do my first vinegar reduction.
i 'm not adding my seasonings now.
because each time the vinegar reduces it, either makes it a little too much concentrated or might not be enough.
so once i had the cabbage at the right texture that i like, i will then add my seasonings 'cause it would be perfect and ready to go.
second , single reduction.
i 'm going to wilt this about thirty percent, more, and then i 'm going to be ready to add that rest of my seasonings.
my crowd is at the texture that i wanted to be little crunchy.
still , but definitely soft, a lot of liquid is been evaporated.
and i 'm going to go ahead and add my salt.
approximately i do n't know.
one tablespoon some ground mustard seed that a half a teaspoon and sure sugar, sugar hey brown sugar in about two loop, three tablespoons anster by the way that was about.
i 'd say, well, you have a half a cabbage head.
boy less muscle meals, and is always taste to adjust your seasoning.
will you be up in PM?
some sauerkraut, and this is been your tip for the week.
and i will see you next week with another bootleg tip.
