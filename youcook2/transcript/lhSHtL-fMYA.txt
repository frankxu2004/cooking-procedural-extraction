i 'm gonna be cooking one of my all time, favorite korean dishes talk albion, we realize that we 've actually never done like a restaurant review of taco before that 's.
because once i learn how to make this at home.
i just never went out to eat it again, you know, if you can cook at home without any pants on that 's like the best thing is n't it past the date.
this recipe seems complicated because i have like a gazillion ingredients.
but it 's really just building the sauce and the sauce is just like unceremoniously dumped into a bowl.
i usually just make the sauce and like a huge vat, and i keep in a jar in the fridge, and it holds forever.
and then when you want to cook it you just add the chicken in the fresh ingredients today.
i 'll make a small version so that you guys can follow along at home, alright let 's build the sauce.
i 'm starting out with my secret ingredient, which is adding korean style curry to this mix now.
when you think of curry you might be thinking of, like an indian courier indonesian curry.
you want like the yellow curry, i have no other way to explain this to you.
so i 'm using the ones that are kind of already in a boolean pack.
if you ca n't find the korean kind, you can actually use the japanese one as well.
i 've used both.
and they work just fine.
and we 're going to add a half a cup of hot water.
this is just let it match around while i 'm getting other stuff together.
if you 're using fresh ginger, you do n't want to do this.
but i 'm doing these like really cool rehydration cubes.
make me feel like i live in the future look at them with that awesome.
so it 's like fresh ginger, hydrated into little cube formats going to rehydrate them in there, go rehydrate my pretties.
get yourself a big bowl for mixing the marinade in.
i 've already put in my minced garlic, and i 'm going to jump in all the curry that i already have in here with the garlic, and i 'm going to start adding everything to this, as well, this is the great.
like i just put in bold part not in the go to god which.
no , you cannot replace it with, like a chili powder or a pop rica, this is like a korean style.
red pepper flakes, so it has a very specific taste to it that i ca n't explain like it really hot.
i bought the extra very spicy, red pepper powder, but you can get the normal one as well.
oh , yeah, we 're gonna be part of blood, and i want enough you can do two tablespoons if you want.
but i like the flavor a bit quarter teaspoon of black pepper.
one of my all time, favorite korean words remember whether word is simon chan, funny story, but when simon and i were teaching we showed our students twilight.
and there 's a part where bellas, dad asks her if she needs pepper spray, and the kids did n't understand what that was.
so someone was, like OK, it 's kind of like you ca n't go choose, which means like pepper, does she get andy spreyton, someones eyes.
but then he realized that coach who is a slang word for penis, so he basically told the students to take a penis and shake and spray it.
but luckily they were too innocent to understand it and sign mado for his cell phone and called me immediately was like towards drawers from schools work, and then, i used to chew, it was fine penis.
also , go to add in half a teaspoon assaults boom, boom.
yes , i keep my salt in a strawberry jar, which i can imagine is confusing for some people just in case we have some robbers, they come here.
and they want to steal our salt domain thoroughly confused there confused.
an extra tablespoon of the curry powder.
this is, oh, no.
it 's one of these OK just heading in a tablespoon of soy sauce dividing in two tablespoons of mirin, which is like a japanese sweet rice wine, and i do n't know how to explain it.
someone explain it for me.
and the old lady actress that won the oscar helen mirren, yeah, yep.
they just condense all of her tears and sweat into a bottle and it 's really popular in japan.
i 'm at in two teaspoons.
we 're doing one and a half to two, depending on how your feeling.
yes , sharing a single problem for this.
yeah , look at that i 'm going to grab the chicken that i 've already sliced up into strips, just dump it in here to soak for a bit mom chicken.
we 're going to soak and then we 're going to move on to another part of the day on to stage two while your chicken is just soaking.
if you do have sweet potatoes, you 're going to need to get started on cooking these because it takes awhile to soften up over these guys in an.
i 'm going to add a little bit of cabbage just so that we have a little bit of water action, happening in there.
an public a little and so, well, that is, steaming.
we 're going to start soaking are duck.
turn my phone number, can i get here?
OK , i 'm going to add the green onions.
i kinda missed northeast, this ones for you.
simon mercy, they 're kind of brown, all that stuff.
you 're just trying to kind of like soften it.
we 're going to add in all of our chicken and everything.
now take a little hole in the center.
i know some people like soap, this overnight and everything, but i found no differences i tried both versions.
oh , yeah, spell awesome, already, and i 'm going to add to the rest of my cabbage boom, the cabbage is really important for adding voice to this issue has just make sure everything is nicely coated.
he often amina.
flatten it down OK medium yet.
and i 'm going to let this team for a bit.
i 'm going to put on a timer for about eight to ten minutes.
this entire meal is pretty much done within fifteen minutes, what kind of time or do you have, are you a professional chef or using a bear timer that 's professional, it 's counting down.
that 's its job time.
are complete judgments?
five minutes has gone by i 'm going to add a little bit of water to this just going out about a quarter cup.
we 're going to add docs in.
and i want to make sure there 's enough liquid in here so the dark, uh, something to absorb broken drain off the water.
i 'm going to just add on top now.
my mushrooms, and.
now i 'm going to add in the korean sesame E leaves on top of this, if you ca n't find this, you can actually use basil.
instead , guess come on over here.
i have this little tiny garden.

i think you guys saw on instagram.
i talked about it, a little bit.
it 's called click.
it and grow you literally put in this little like cartridge with the seeds in it.
just jump into water and plug it in.
and we left for japan and when i came back three weeks later, i had full basil.
it 's a really nice match for technologies.
i 'm also gonna be adding cheese kind of cheese is it pizza cheese.
you 're looking for like the lowest quality.
meltable , mozzarella cheese not anything, high quality, i killed the heat before i added in the basel.
i 'm just going to sprinkle this all over with my delicious, baked cheese and then put the lid on it.
leave it there for a bit, and then we can get ready for the wrapping parts, and i do n't mean hip-hop rapping, i mean, lettuce should n't i be doing this part of the video.
