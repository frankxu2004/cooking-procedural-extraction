hi , welcome to marry cooks.
would you believe i 've been researching for over an hour and a half on one particular recipe that i want to do today?
and this is a recipe that my mother taught me and my family.
all does its traditional recipe in our family.
it 's past officially which means beings impostor pasta and beans and the italian way of saying it is pasta effort.
jolie , i got on the internet.
i got out all my, my favorite cookbooks.
and i 've been researching different recipes for pasta visually.
and you would n't believe how many recipes.
there are how many versions of this particular dish, so today.
what i 'd like to do is i like to show you.
in fact, it 's a very inexpensive meal to make for the family.
so , i think in these times i 'd say probably it takes maybe about five ingredients.
the main ingredients naturally the two main ingredients are going to be our beans in our pasta and the beans were going to use or canna.
lily beans a white kidney.
bean and the pasta is a tiny little two type pastor call.
ditalini , so that 's a pasta.
and that 's a.
beans , then the other ingredients are crushed tomatoes, possibly basil and italian, you always need your garlic salt and pepper ann are seasoning.
will be dry oregano dry basil, and if you notice i buy large size basil and oregano?
since i use those.
so much of my cooking and that 's another economical way of saving money by buying the larger sizes if you use it as much as i do we 're going to do.
first , we 're going to drain the beans and let me explain something about the beans.
this is one size pan.
this is twenty nine point five.
can this is another size canned by another company, and this is fifteen point five ounces?
if you use the fifteen point five ounces will need two cans.
i 'm just using one can of the twenty nine point five ounces.
so we want to drain the beans, and we want to also ring stem.
there 's a lot of salt on the beans do some water can get the bottom out of there.
and i 'm left the dutch rain, let that sit on the side.
we 're not going to use those until much later.
i 'm going to go ahead and start chopping up my spices and will get back to you in a second.
maybe i should put my glasses on when i 'm giving you measurements and sizes.
i made a.
mistake , this size can is nineteen ounces, and it was n't till after i drain them.
did i realize that 's not going to be enough beans?
so i would say two cans this size would be what you would want since i only have this and the small, along which is fifteen point five that.
but i would recommend the nineteen hours which is a pound in three ounces.
she cans of those.
let 's start now making our sauce.
so , first we 're going to cope the bottom of our sauce pan with some olive oil, i 'd say probably that 's a tablespoon of olive oil.
that , that get hot an i have that on medium, high going to add two cloves of garlic, which had been minced.
so let 's say the coolican kills translucent.
but do n't want it to get brown distracted, skip the fragrance is coming out OK that 's fine two cans of crushed italian tomatoes and i found this particular brand on sale whenever i see italian tomatoes, whole tomatoes, a crushed tomatoes on sale i stock up.
so this is my first time using this particular brand.
but it 's crushed italian tomatoes, two cans he 's.
now that garlic user twenty eight ounce cans are salt, half a teaspoon of salt use kosher salt or cost, sea salt, sometimes i 'll use crush black pepper half a teaspoon.
let 's do a teaspoon of dried oregano and dried basil, two tablespoons of chopped posley italian parsley flat leaf parsley and two tablespoons of fresh chopped basil nix that through, well, get the pot.
the sauce to start coming to a boil.
and once it does turn it down to low, and let it simmer for about fifteen to twenty minutes we want the spices to blend in with the tomato sauce.
so fifteen or twenty minutes should do a good job of letting every crushed red pepper to this, if you like, or chopped jalapeno pepper, if you like your sauce hot.
i like mine.
icy side, so i 'm going to add old probably about half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper, while this is simmering we put a cover on let that simmer fifteen to twenty minutes.
i 'm going to stop.
this is a one pound box.
i 'm going to use half of this.
so we 're going to use half a pound of ditalini pasta that will add to the sauce when it 's ready.
i drain the macaroni, and i 'm going to add it to the tomato sauce that 's half a pound.
it 'll weenie children love that shape of pastor and.
now going at aired the white kidney beans.
next this through the beans are cooked and the past is cooked.
so all we 're going to do is just incorporate all of the flavorings together some pasta visually is very thin, it 's very soupy.
this is where this one is different.
this is more like a stupid, you know, how rachel ray says stoop for soup, and a stew.
this is more of a stew consistency, so that, that 's not very soup.
now we 're going to let this cook simmered.
i 'd say or cooking on low for about another ten minutes, just incorporate all of those seasonings into the beans, an the pasta, and then we 'll be ready to something for about ten minutes, and it 's ready.
it 's great now as you can see it 's thicker than a soup, but it 's still running with the tomatoes things.
macaroni pasta visually i like to serve it with some grated parmesan cheese, an crusty italian roll.
nice crusty italian roll pasta visually on upper teeth enjoy.
