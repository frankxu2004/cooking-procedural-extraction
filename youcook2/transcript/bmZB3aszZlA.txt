everyone is chilly today will be making one of my favorite childhood dishes, spaghetti and meatballs super easy and delicious almost every person on planet earth enjoys a delicious bowl of spaghetti and meatballs at least once a year right , right.
so let 's get started.
so use a saute pan with high sides to make my sauce drizzled a little bit of olive oil and throw in my chopped onions.
i saute the onions on medium.
low heat, about three minutes.
make sure not to burn them and then adding your mince garlic after i threw in the garlic.
i season it with a pinch of salt and pepper.
then i threw in the fresh basil do not saute the garlic for more than fifteen to twenty seconds.
garlic burns extremely quickly.
i like to use one can of peeled tomatoes and one can of crushed tomatoes you can do both cans of crushed tomatoes.
but i do like the sauce to be a little bit chunky, and you wo n't get a chunky sauce from a can of crushed tomatoes poured in about a cup of water to loosen up a bit, i took a potato masher, or in this case, a tomato measure and i mashed up those tomatoes, even though you mash the tomatoes, you 're still going to have little chunks of tomatoes floating around your sauce and that 's what i love ironically, i hated those chunks of tomatoes in my sauce when i was a kid i also hate it fruit chunks in my yogurt as a kid, thinks really change when you get older though i season them with salt pepper oregano and a little bit of sugar tomatoes can be a bit sour and the sugar will help with that some people recommend adding half of a grated carrot, carrot her sweet.
but sugar works for me we tried looking for the lid of the span i could n't find it.
so i use aluminum foil and then i lowered the heat to medium low.
so while the sauce was simmering and started making my meatballs i used a blend of beef pork and veal i broke it up with my fingers, you may use a fork if you do n't want to use a blend of beef pork and veal you can use beef by itself, and they will be delicious as well here it have one slice of bread that i placed in my food processor an, i added it to my beef, you can just break it up with your fingers i threw in some parsley fresh garlic i did n't use onions since the sauce already has onions i do it has garlic too.
but you can never have enough garlic and egg, some milk to moisten things up a bit of chili powder i like the ticket gives lots of parmesan cheese and make sure to season this well with salt and pepper and.
now i did mention earlier that spaghetti and meatballs was my favorite childhood dish i used to make it all the time by myself, while i watch nickelodeon, if you 're wondering how i made it back then two words, chef boyardee manhunt truth or dare monopoly pool margo, follow doug and rugrats there was just no time for cooking when i was a kid.
so all my young viewers, making all of these recipes you guys, seriously rock flowering mix the meat until everything is incorporated.
but make sure not to overmix and.
now if you 're a beginner cook you might struggle with the salt and pepper to taste when things are wrong like this.
so little tip i could give you is to fry little piece like i showed you or one meatball before you start rolling all of them, the worst thing you can do is serve your guests under season food.
so that 's optional to do i rolled little meatballs like this, you may make them as little or as big as you like whatever size you prefer just make sure they 're all the same size.
so they all cook evenly.
so in a skillet with some vegetable right, the meatballs for about three to four minutes on each side over medium high heat the inside will still be raw.
but i like to finish cooking them in the sauce they 're pretty small.
so i just rock my skillet back and forth and ledges flip over on their own if their bigger you can always eat some tongs to flip them over my sauce has been simmering for about twenty minutes, or.
so i like to add some extra fresh basil i placed the meatballs into the pan, and i let them simmer in the sauce for an additional twenty minutes or so, covered and funny thing is i love spaghetti and meatballs.
so much as a kid that when i went to restaurants with my parents, i would always order spaghetti and meatballs, and they would cringe oh, well, i could n't get enough alright.
so i placed a spaghetti into my pan i do n't like to serve it diner style, diner style they just last onto your pasta and they do n't completely drain the pasta.
so i like to mix the pasta with the sauce during the pasta, really, well, i just do n't prefer it and watery.
so this is how i served it, it was completely drenched in the sauce, which i 'd love an it was a bit messy.
but i cleaned it off later i like to serve three to four meatballs per person.
but of course, it all depends on the actual person my brother prefer six to seven meatballs.
so this in total should take about forty five minutes to make.
so worth it the kids will love it you will love it i placed two fazoli 's on top to make it look cute i hope you guys really good, this recipe, a try, i hope you enjoy this video and thank you all.
so much for watching.
