hi , everyone, welcome to thrifty crafts.
today , we 're going to cook a vegan dish, which will be a traditional korean kimchi.
but vegan so it 's a very nice traditional dish yet without all the fish ingredients.
you want to press pause here and have a careful look at all the ingredients.
you 're going to need.
and you 're also going to have other requirements, such as a ball blender cheesecloth in a plastic glove, and this is a bowl of leaks, an radish garlic, and pine nuts.
i just wanted to show you what your ingredients should look like once you 've gathered them altogether but step one.
very important step is you need to pickle some sliced radish.
and they need to be soft, and you need to hold on, make sure you do n't get rid of the liquid 'cause you 're going to need them later.
then , step two.
you want to dice all your leaks and your korean radish and leaks you want to cut about an inch.
and , then cut them vertically going with the grain.
this is just for presentation.
it just looks a little cleaner and nicer.
and it looks more appetizing.
so here 's a dish of leaks and radish.
it should look like that you should have two leaks in there.
an one radish all die stuff and there 's the korean radish all dice.
if you have a dice are that, that would make your life a lot easier if you 're making kimchi next step.
what we 're going to do is blend ginger spanish onion.
garlic pine nuts and the pickle radish with the fluid altogether.
now they 're not going to all.
fit in the blender.
so you 're probably going to have to divide them up.
and if you do n't like pine nuts, you can skip out on the pine nuts.
the more pine nuts you put the more high night flavor, you 'll get out of the kimchi, but you can always skip that.
so here we go we 're going to blend everything together by the way, if you have win decks at home instead of using win decks, you can make your own cleaner with vinegar and water quarter, vinegar and three quarters water.
and it works just like win decks.
but it 's better for your health and the environment.
so now what we 're going to do is put on the gloves and pour all that blended stuff into a cheesecloth.
now what we need, is just the liquid.
so we 're not going to make sure that we strain out all the other residues.
and you 're going to have to do this few times so you 're going to have to squeeze out all the.
juice , and again blend everything remaining and squeeze it again.
and you 're going to do this over and over again until you 've squeeze out.
all the juice out of the ingredients that were blending together.
now , if you need some more fluid, you can always use the strained fluid again and put it back into the blender.
that 's fine, but you 're just going to have to string it out again.
this will just help the planning process, a little more step six.
you want add the blend of fluid to the bowl of leak and radish.
sure , you put them all together.
and then we 're going to add the hot pepper.
flakes , now you can use mild hot pepper flakes, depending on how spicy you want your kimchi to be.
then you also want to use your flakes accordingly.
because if you want it really spicy, you can add as much as we 're adding here if you ca n't handle spice as much you might want to reduce the amount of hot flicks that will be going into the bowl.
and , of course, you want to stir occasionally to make sure you are mixing them altogether.
if you 're wondering why there 's.
so many that block of hot pepper flakes, it 's.
because we 're using different spice level of hot pepper flights, you can mix.
them up you can put really hot.
mix it with mild, or you can just put a spicy or you can just put mild.
it 's up to you, you know, we 're putting a lot of pepper flakes here.
it 's very, very spicy.
traditional kimchi, then we also wanted to add two and a half tablespoon of salt as well, and do n't forget to taste them a little bit.
you want to make sure that it 's not too salty.
i also want to include here that sea salt is much better for you and it 's also taste year.
then you want to add one tablespoon of honey just to get a little bit of sweetness, and this is what you should be left with.
now what we 're going to do is.
show you how to marinate the cabbage you want to cut off some of the stem.
it 's a little bit brown.
do n't worry, that 's just stains from the soil?
and you can just cut those pieces off like.
so if you see any brown leaves, you also want to get rid of those, as well, now, once you have your cabbage in your bowl you want to take some of the marination and just dab it all over and do a generously, and you want to put more on the bottom and less as you go.
so the top as the leafs get smaller, and just apply them everywhere generously with your gloves on this is where gloves come in very handy.
because you do n't want your hands to smell like garlic for the next week or have the red stains.
so , once you put all these marination all over the cabbage what you want to do is wrapped them if you can, with the last leaf kind of in twirling around the rest of them.
so it 's just.
so that everything holds together.
and they may not always look like that, and that 's OK, the whole point is just a smear all the marination all over the cabbage and we 're going to do it again here, and do n't forget to do it layer by layer.
so peel each leaf at a time as you apply the stuffing became cheese stuffing and again.
you want to make sure that you have a stainless steel container or a glass container.
make sure you do n't put it in plastic containers.
it 's not good for your health and you 'll find that it tastes a lot better in a glass container, if possible and that 's it.
so thanks for watching, and i hope to see you next time.
