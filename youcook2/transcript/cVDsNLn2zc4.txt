well , solide season, an for a special occasion i love fois gras.
this is a fois gras.
it 's giant overstuffed fat liver of a duck or goose in this case, it 's a duck from canada.
because the peter nuts have made it.
so it 's very difficult to grow these in the states and by the way, if you repeated not you can just switch off right now.
i love this stuff.
i do n't care what anyone thinks, i 'm going to eat.
it occasionally is about a two pound load.
it 's about a hundred bucks worth of liver.
it does n't taste it all, like liver, basically it 's meat flavored butter.
if you were to cook this in an oven slowly all the fat would drain out of it a piece about the size of a great.
because it 's almost all fat there 's very little work to do on one of these things you can see pretty clearly it comes in two pieces.
so you can break the pieces of part, or you can just slice it straight across, if you slice across that 's great, they may fall apart.
and if you want one very even piece, you may find you want to slice it lengthwise.
i 'm going to sort of a combination of both by slicing it sort of diagonally along with decrease that 's in.
here , so that in case, the pieces do sort of fall, apart, there 's minimal waste.
it did cost as i said about a hundred dollars.
it 's about fifty bucks a pound.
however , you 're going to get a good twelve to sixteen servings out of this thing.
so it 's not exactly what you would call economical.
but it 's not that hard.
stoppingly , expensive, either, the best way to cut is to use a long thin knife like a carving knife and wash it in hot water between cuts.
the hot blade of the knife will cut right through it like butter and make very nice clean cut.
so would fill up a picture and use that to warm a finite.
we 're going four portions of this appetizer, one of these giant claws would obviously make a lot more than that.
another thing to remember is we 're going to use all the fat that comes off this, to cook everything else.
so we 're doing it in a skillet, and we 're not going through any of the fat away.
but nice slice about a quarter of an inch thick fois gras experts out there will tell you, you need to clean the nerves and veins out of this thing, i think that 's completely unnecessary, and a waste of time and will actually ruin the way the fois gras looks 'cause you 're going to tear it up into pieces.
so i have four very nice slices here.
these do n't need very much seasoning except for just a little salt and pepper, i would n't put very much.
i will sprinkle a little bit of my season salt land, and my season pepper not much that 's that.
now also we have some very thinly sliced shallots here.
shallots are like little red onions.
there 's sort of a cross between a red onion and garlic.
they had a great flavor if you did n't have shallots you could use red onion.
best way to peel a shallot kind of length wise 'cause sometimes there in a figure eight shaped.
and pulled the entire outer layer off and remember.
you 're not wasting that.
because you 're going to use it for your soup stock as we 've talked about many times and i liked it when i 'm sauteing them i like to cut them lengthwise.
does it really matter probably not slicing them.
thin OK couple more pieces to this, and once all the pieces are ready will get cooking.
we 're going to put some apple.
we 're going to saute some apple.
nice thin slices of apple.
this is a fairly crisp firm, textured apple that has a mixture of tart and sweet this kind is called fuji.
you may have a different kind available where you live use, whatever you like you want your pan hot.
but not screeching hot.
because you could burn the flaw or overcook it, and when you overcook it, it will melt down to nothing.
flog raw goes in.
first , you can see the fat comes starts coming out immediately, maybe thirty seconds of on a side is all.
see , just an unbelievable amount of fat coming out, we 're going to use that to our advantage so you can see the color is just, golden brown.
it 's not black.
it 's not deep around.
we 're going to remove these two plate.
whatever you do, do not drain news on paper towels because then all the juice and all the fat will go into the paper towel?
then you wo n't be able to eat it now into the fat.
we grill our bread on both sides just getting the bread.
so they do n't burn and.
anna , little pepper to the challenge again these seasoning mixes are available on the web.
the recipes are on the website, if you do n't want to make him yourself.
he would be happy to sell some to you.
shallots are starting to get nicely brown.
they 're not quite finished yet.
so we 'll move them off to the side and put in, our apples.
alright just till the apples, gets off a little bit of color on am, i think we 're ready to assemble.
so , another plate, lovely piece of toast some of the shallots nice piece of law.
fantastic little piece of apple.
pick this up and eat it with your hands or eat it with a knife and fork.
but , however you eat it a fantastic special holiday appetizer, wagra, on baguettes, shallots and apple.
