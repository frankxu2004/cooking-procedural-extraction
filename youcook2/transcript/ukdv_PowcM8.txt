i cannot wait what is it about the flying burger that just keeps people coming back from war, mostly unique flavors of the hawaiian burger, fresh grilled pineapple and the teriyaki sauce just makes you wanna.
take a bite every single time.
maybe she was the first thing that we need to do to make the hawaiian burger.
well , the first thing we 're going to do is get our fresh sliced pineapple.
we 're going to take it right on over to the grill and put two slices on now.
i understand you guys use a lot of pineapple.
it islands fourteen thousand pounds per week that is crazy seven thousand pineapples for weeks and this is really going to bring out that smokey flavor kind of karma lies with a little bit.
yes , that 's what makes our burgers so unique, is using fresh ingredients?
so , while that 's cooking, we 're going to go ahead and get the burger.
patties look how big that burger is islands, has the biggest burgers do?
so we 're going to see some are burgers with our special island, seasoning just about three shakes is fine.
and you guys wait to season the burger until it 's on the grill.
what kind of purposes that serve and actually brings out this evening.
a little bit better once, it 's at how long are we going to cook the burger for usually cook it.
but so make sure what are the common mistakes that people make when they 're making burgers.
well , you have to be patient oftentimes.
the mistake is they pressed down on the.
burger , which takes all the juices, cells.
so when your patient you just watch the juices rise.
and then we 're ready to put all right.
so you can click that bergeron over for us oh, so yummy.
so after the flip we immediately get our swiss cheese and put it right on that is another.
tip , you put on the cheese right away, and we 're using swiss cheese.
we are using specialties today for the hawaiian perfect, and you already see that it 's starting to correct the burger patty really nicely melted.
so we really want to wait for that melts down a little bit more.
we did already slipped the pineapple.
so the pineapples almost ready as well, we 're going to actually put the pineapple right on there.
so just, like the burger patties in the pineapple we put our buns on the grill as well.
so we want to make sure there nicely toasted as you see here.
we have a nice toasted bun and that really enhances the flavor, so it 's nice and crispy inside, but flavorful, an soft on the outside perfect.
no , this is the best part now.
we 're going to assemble the burger with the first component.
so we 're taking our nice girl.
bottom bun, and we 're going coast to coast with the many, so we 're not shy with our portions, well, i love that 'cause i love mayonnaise.
yes , coast to coast, right across the bottom of the blend.
so it 's all nice and even.
now we 're going to add a little bit of lettuce.
so just a good handful.
and then a slice of onion i love it going to get the crunch of the young and the crunch.
the pineapples and all of our produces cut fresh every day so you get you really want to make sure you are using fresh product again.
really enhances flavors and then we 're going to grab a burger patty.
OK , we have the mannys, covered bun, the crisp lettuce.
the onion the tomato, and then that juicy piece of beef.
the melted swiss, and that smokey juicy pineapple, that kind of gives it that little sweet factor.
and then the last thing we 're going to do which is my all time favorite is putting a nice party scoop full of teriyaki right on top with a burger oh, my goodness an entire scoop love that i and then you 'll start to kind of see that creep down through the cheese in the burger patty, and then we 're going to top it with their nice chris gosh myesha.

now we take in that grilled pineapple that we grow on the grill, if you still, with articulate for three whole days just for this one drink and then we also have muddled pineapple in there, and then we have a garnish with pineapple and the pineapple , leaves.
