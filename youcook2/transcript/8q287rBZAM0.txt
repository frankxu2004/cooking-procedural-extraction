versum alex, different looking and today we 're making an overtime.
friends classic the moonman year has known as muscles in marinara sauce.
fresh seafood in a barry white wine and shallot sauce.
so it 's tasty is cheap.
it 's easy and it 's a french dish.
you can make in under ten minutes come on guys, let 's do it.
stuff grab a few shallots and mince them roughly.
best two cloves of garlic pick up a small bunch of parsley and a stock of celery for both separate the least from the stokes we use define antenna leaves in the dish.
but the fiber stokes will pimp and pump up the flavors of a bunch of dried herbs.
so , i guess that 's it for them in some, plus meezan plus middle class is just offensive french word for preparation, but, you know, it 's always good to insert a fancy french word into cooking conversation.
so i was to share by vicious museum, passes the cafe, but it felt like deja vu.
maybe that 's too much now.
we need some muscles.
and i reckon dis seafood is quite amazing.
delicious versatile and on top of that.
it 's sustainable use about a kilo of muscles for two people, using them and are running cold water.
give them a good scrub and remove any dirt barnacles of fiber stuff.
this cut the broken ones and also the ones who would not close when lightly squeezed in a large casserole pan over medium heat and a good novel better.
i 'm in a serious one infusing the bunch of dried herbs in the seating, better will ensure a better distribution of the romans at the end, dropping the shallots and garlic and cook them till they get soft.
after a few minutes for in a good amount of fresh an acidic white wine like muscadet or, sauvignon or whatever one, you like season well, with salt and pepper and let the wine evaporate a bit.
so the amount of whining this recipe is totally up to you.
i am using half a bottle of it, because i like it and also because i want to spend some glasses for the meal afterwards.
you can use beer instead, or you can use apple cider as well, or if you do n't want to use alcohol.
you can use a pint of veg stock and drizzle of vinegar and still, the dish will be amazing.
i 'm telling you, french cooking is not casting stone.
what 's important is that you own it plays the muscles in along with the celery, leaves cook them covered for about five minutes, stirring once or twice when they open nicely.
they 're ready to go.
just discard the closed one.
it might not be exactly in the classic muscle, marinara recipe.
but i like to add a dash of double cream in mind, you know, just to make it a bit more naughty.
and also because i own it, sprinkle that with parsley and storm went combine all those lovely ingredients together, flavors are intense and perfectly balanced.
but irma certain shallots bring a deep richness yet the white wine and herbs bring a much appreciated freshness.
serve them as they are always french fries, on the side, so guys.
i told you this recipe is nothing difficult and considering the amazing result at the end, you should definitely give it a try.
