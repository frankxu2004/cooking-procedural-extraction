hi guys, how are you today, today 's recipe is really, really delicious.
it 's a version of tabouli, using roasted vulgar and tons, and tons of one of my very favorite herbs, parsley.
i ca n't wait to share it with you.
the first thing that you need to do though, is roast, three pints of cherry tomatoes.
these are n't actually cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes.
that 's OK, too.
just slice them in half made us look good spread.
the tomatoes out on a rimmed baking sheet they 're going to fill a hole, rimmed baking sheet, and then drizzle with about five teaspoons of oil give.
take , you know, me, i 'll probably go a little bit more, heavy handed, but you can use five teaspoons.
i love olive oil, and i think it 's really good for you, and this is a mediterranean recipes.
so it should have plenty of oil sprinkle with salt and just give it a shake or toss it up.
and then, the other thing that makes this recipe really special besides the roasted tomatoes is roasted vulgar.
so i have one cup of bulgur, and i 'm putting that on a smaller baking sheet.
the tomatoes and the vulgar both go into a four hundred and fifty degree, oven tomatoes for thirty minutes, fifteen, normally use just a plain boulger that simmered in water.
they were going to roast it so that it gets a really nice depth of toasty flavor.
all that stuff starts roasting, i 'm going to get my onion ready.
i have one medium red onion.
i 'm just going to slice it, and then halfway through the tomato, roasting, i 'm going to add this onion.
i like to remove the core for this, so that they fall apart into little slices.
so slice your red onion into very thin slices.
it 's going to roast with the tomatoes for about fifteen minutes in the oven, i love this recipe.
because it takes sort of a classic light salad, and gives it a lot of depth of flavor by roasting all the ingredients except the parsley, parsley does not get roasted and here.
we have my favorite ingredient.
what makes such abulia, tabouli, the parsley, i have two pretty big bunches of flat leaf parsley, well, washed well, dried.
i beg of you.
if ever there is a time to wash and really well, dryer parsley, it 's when you 're making tabbouleh.
if you do n't and it soggy, you 'll be so.
so sad, and you 'll say sarah in florida, me implored me to wash and dry my parsley really well, and i did n't do it now.
i understand why it 's because i love you.
once you have your big huge pile of parsley, then you want to coarsely chop it.
this pile is so big.
i do n't even know.
i 'm going to chop it.
i 'm shopping and, shopping, and shopping the pilot is definitely getting smaller.
if you have a food processor, and you want to do this in your food processor that 's totally cool.
just do n't over process.
it you 're not looking for a pesto texture.
here you want, a course chop that looks good.
i 'm going to add the onions tomatoes now and get the bulger out of the oven vulgar out, and then to the tomatoes.
add the onion, add your onion to the tomatoes.
stir it around and then, back in the oven for about fifteen minutes, tomatoes and onions go back in for about fifteen more minutes.
and while that 's finishing cooking, you can cook your boulger.
it 's been roasted for flavored, not needs to simmer in two cups of water for about fifteen minutes to hydrate my tomatoes and onions are out of the oven, once the bulger has cooked for fifteen minutes, just let it cool off a little bit.
and i have combined that with one can of drained chickpeas just a little bit of extra protein.
now it 's just time to combine everything, take your tomatoes onions combine it with your chick peas in bulger this is a really, really hardy tabouli.
almost i would venture to say a main course to bully, so add your tomatoes and onions to the chick peas and vulgar and then all your parsley.
probably , like a cup and a half of parsley, you know, that 's making me happy is going to make you happy.
i hope so.
and then a tablespoon of olive oil give or take salt, and lemon juice to taste the salt and lemon juice are really today.
so i 'm going to start with a half a lemon and see where that goes.
i 'll need more.
but you never know you do n't want to overdo it right.
but this is a big salad.
start up, look at that party lunch dinner.
i do n't know breakfast.
i think this is a platter or the dish.
what about you.
make sure you taste it in just for seasoning to your liking.
if you wanted to add a little bit of feta cheese to this and make it fun vegan.
this recipe makes plenty for tonight 's dinner and tomorrow 's lunch.
so save some pack it up and take it to the office and watch everybody be super jealous.
where 'd you get the recipe.
sarah gave it to me and let me tell you roasting the bulger really does make a difference.
you could skip that step.
i suppose, but why bother, i 'm going to eat this whole platter.
healthy , happy and hardy.
it 's fantastical guys.
