today 's feel good food is meso soup with tofu.
it 's fantastically, nutritious.
low calorie, low fat, and can be prepared in well under ten minutes.
we 're going to stop using miso paste.
mirin and soy.
and then fill it out with oyster mushrooms tofu and edamame beans?
start , need to make the stock so a couple of cups of water into a pan and bring it up to boil.
and two are water.
we 're going to add our miso soup paste.
this is already a combination of miso paste.
so , fermented beans, and fermented rice cured with sort stock can dash studies really intensive, but obviously going to add it to the water and finish right out.
so squeeze that in there is this easy to get hold of this premade paste the pre made stuff.
the miso soup, very easy you 'll get that in most supermarkets, if you want to actually make your own, then you need the dashi powder in the miso paste, you might need to asian supermarkets.
but premixed dead easy to that.
we 're also going to add half of vegetable stock.
you , and then we 've got mirrored talk about two tablespoons of mirror and one tablespoon of soy, roughly sold out mixing weed taste later and add it and amend it.
tell me when to stop so that 's about two tablespoons of mirror OK, which is a sweet rice wine.
and then one tablespoons are half as much of soy, all we need to do is heat out very gently.
you do n't really want to boil it because that 's when it goes cloudy.
you , wanna keep it a very, very gentle simmer.
and then we can add in order other flavors with oyster mushrooms.
so you spent already coming together now, these we just want to slice into nice thin slices if you can do majority of that bowl and we 've also got at a mommy beans.
now that you can buy frozen soybeans just defrost them.
and we 're going to add those to the supers.
well , i 've had these in restaurants where they still, in the pot and then will salty on the outside.
so you can get them in their pods, or even easier.
still , i think frozen out, exactly you would peas or broad beans.
so this is going to be pretty quick to make them yeah, i mean, we nearly halfway there.
if we put all the mushrooms in with our beans, they need to very gently kind of heat up and simmer for two or three minutes, just soften the mushrooms and warm beans through, and that 's pretty much it.
this is really speedy kind of diet, friendly great tasting suit that you can throw together in minutes.
this is fresh tofu.
we need to do is take it and cut it into really neat little squares.
remember me server going to serve it with a small spoon.
so you wo n't be there going to fit on the spoon.
so if we can cut into pieces.
the thing with tofu is it has very little.
if any flavors so subtle, so i think we 've got going here.
yeah , it would take on all that flavor, flavor spanish is like a flavor sponge that 's really good for you.
those mushrooms need another few seconds to warm through.
and then i 'll tell you can go in the mean time.
we can look at our spring onions.
you can just do a very, very fine, shred defining the better.
and they 're going to go in really last minute.
literally we service you get that crunch and that fresh kind of spring onion kick this is our last ingredient that is how simple, this is, but.
i promise you taste it, you will be impressed.
you can see we 've made about two portions here, but if you 're going to make it, you might as well make it big backs.
and then you can actually use it throughout the week.
so you will, i work in a floss to keep warm.
or you can just reheat it a bit at a time throughout the course of a couple of days just as easily.
but i 'll tell you can go in now.
do you have to use tapes or is there something else that you can replace it with?
if you do n't like to, too, i think once you 've got to the base, the miso flavors, then you can add what you want.
so some shredded poached chicken.
nicely , or some prawns, again anything it 's lean, high in protein.
perfectly in this dish to finish it off all of these spring onions you to be sliced go in there and that 's it is.
so simple that is, the suit we have to do is serve it.
make sure you get plenty of mushroom plenty of tofu.
you notice soup when people say, or when you deal with noodle soup, yeah, that would be this is exactly that 's so much health in one bowl.
we 've got our spoons.
as , well, now have a taste of what we think of everything in my speed.
good right, yeah, really good really fresh and which that quick to make actually no excuses not to give it ago i ca n't believe how healthy it tastes.
let 's bring an injury, make it fresh and quite zingy.
i love it amazing for more feel good food.
make sure you subscribe to two forty talk.
and if you want the full details of this recipe had to sorted food dot com.

now we actually think it 's try it with this thing.
so it again have a taste test with these things as well.
that is really good.
it is sort of chili, healthy hearty vegetarian food.
but this is really good because it 's as you said it 's hearty and it 's so cold at the moment.
