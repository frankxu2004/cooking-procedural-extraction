so we just came back from firefly.
we 're back at row.
so we 're going to go ahead and make a traditional italian pasta recipe called penny ala vodka and since we were just have firefly.
i figured we 'd use firefly vodka are good friends.
is a really simple recipe with very few ingredients?
we 've got plum tomatoes.
i use a little bit of tomato paste to kind of pump up the tomato flavor.
garlic salt pepper vodka, of course, cream butter penne pasta.
so the first thing to do since i 'm using whole san marzano tomatoes is, we 're going to cure a them a little bit.
so we have our sauce now, you can use tomato puree if you want straight from the store that works just fine.
this is what i have at the restaurant.
and i like to use these, think they 're pretty flavorful.
so we 're going to just slowly blend this little bit.
now if you do this also at home.
i want to make sure of one thing, do not over blend it?
is what we will do, is?
it will pump air into it and turn it into this pink mess.
it will taste the same.
but it wo n't taste the same.
you kind of lose the intensity of the tomatoes once it 's kind of error rates.
it so, i 'm gonna go ahead.
and i 'm going to add about a tablespoon or so.
tomato paste, that kind of ads that concentrated flavor because we 're going to end up doing is watering down.
the tomato flavor a little bit vodka and the cream i like my vodka sauce with a lot of garlic in it also.
but i do n't like bits of garlic.
this is kind of a bit of an elegant sauce.
so all i do is that basically take about eight ten cloves of garlic him a good whack break, some open put him in the pan and we 're going to go over, set him on the range.
get them sauteing a little bit alright.
the gutter garlic in a pan where do some extra virgin, olive, oil.
and you can use extra virgin.
i do n't care what people have told you about not being able to cook with it, it works just fine for cooking.
we 're going to go ahead.
and we 're going to let this, garlic brown, a little bit and release all of its flavor alright garlic is browning really nicely.
now we 're going to add the tomato now.
be very careful when you do this.
so this all this brown garlic is going to infuse this tomato puree with its flavor.
but it still just tomato puree, so make sure you season.
for the season with salt i was used kosher salt 'cause it 's got a good field to it, it 's like you can pinch a lot of it and control how much you 're putting in.
all right now going to add some black pepper.
we 're going to put in some red pepper flakes now.
i like my vodka sauce a little bit on the spicy side.
we 're going to have a little extra since it 's mine.
we 've got our penne pasta cooking over here and some nice salty water.
always remember that your salt, i mean, your water should be as salty as the mediterranean.
all right now we 're going to add the vodka.
and we 're going to let this.
simmer , and let all those flavors from the garlic salt pepper get in there.
have you tasted it now?
it kind of have a vodka definitely a bloody mary vodka kick to it.
but we 're going to let all the vodka simmer out of this all the alcohol, so now let 's reduce quite a bit.
it 's getting thicker, so go ahead and put in our cream alright.
no , mix it in right now probably about two and a half cups or so of sauce.
i just put in about three quarters of a cup of heavy cream in our pasta is almost done now as i told you early.
we do n't want to keep the garlic chunks in there, so what i 'm going to do is using my slotted spoon going to go ahead.
and i 'm going to remove my garlic.
now we may miss a piece or two.
but that 's not a big deal.
it is garlic after all, and we love garlic are pasta done.
i 'm going to go ahead and add that to the sauce drain it, well, where to go, ahead and working on allow this pasta took cook in the sauce for a little while.
so it absorbs some of the sauce now.
i 've took the passed out when it was al dente.
so still got some bite to it probably a little more bite than you would normally serve right off the bat.
but it 's going to cook a little bit longer.
we 've got some pecorino, romano.
you could use parmigiano, reggiano will keep a little bit on the side for when we put it on the table.
so go ahead and mix that in that will thicken the sauce a little bit more as that depth of flavor that you can only get with a hard dry aged cheese.
i think we 're ready to go here to rich it up a little bit go ahead.
we 're going to mix in a little bit of unsalted butter alright.
here we go penne, alla vodka, now we can just put all of it in here.
using firefly vodka from wadmalaw island, who finished it with a little bit more cheese, little pecorino, romano, a little bit of fresh parsley, gremolada, and there you go penny, ala vodka straight to the table.
thanks for watching off menu.
