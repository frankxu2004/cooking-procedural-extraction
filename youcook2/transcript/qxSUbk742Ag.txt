hi guys, i 'm l'erba tally unlistenable sort of learn the kitchen.
i 'm gonna show, you.
how to make two particle, see basically it 's just muscles and really spicy little broth out of this world, christmas eve is around the corner.
us italians all about the feast of seven fishes, and, you know, you 've got to start with some good super they 'll say so.
that 's already ingredients to get started, you need some fresh mussels.
and i 'll talk about this in a minute.
you 're also going to need one tomato that i have just chopped in large pieces.
some fresh garlic, some parsley, some white wine.
some hot pepper flakes, salt pepper and olive oil that 's it simple.
and it 's really not expensive muscles especially around this time of year or super cheap two ninety nine pounds.
so for your muscles really important that you cleaned up well and first, so what i do is.
i bring a moment, store and if i 'm going to go home in a few hours i usually take a big bowl.
fill it with ice and then just sit in my muscles, right on top.
and then put it in the fridge and then what i do is i take a big bowl or you can use your kitchen sink for example, just make sure it 's really clean, and i filled with water.
i put my muscles in there for fifteen minutes after fifteen minutes.
i bring some and then i scrub them.
i take a clean or knew or they actually make scrubbers specially for muscles, and you just want to scrub, scrub, scrub, both sides of the muscle and sometimes muscles come with a beard done for you, then you need to do it, which means it 's a little piece right here.
it 's called the beard.
and that 's what the muscle attaches to the, to the rocks is a piece, and some little rope and all you gotta do is just rip in that simple.
then , once you have done that you want to go ahead and put them back into the water bowl again with clean water.
put it under fifteen minutes.
rinse them drain.
and you 're good to go now.
want to know what muscles are good or bad, now.
when there fresh and uncooked if the muscles open like that, and, we try to present does n't close get rid of him.
he 's a no go for undercooked.
it 's completely the opposite, if they are closed.
get rid of it, it 's a no go.
so that 's how you know when muscles are fresh in this pan.
you want to make sure that if you 're not using the soup pot using a pain that 's got about three to four inches the sides are pretty high , up.
and i 've got about three tablespoons of olive oil in there is going to be so good, and in here.
i 'm just going to put in my parsley.
my garlic and my tomato.
now you probably are you cooking the, the parsley so ahead of time because normally fresh herbs are used at the last minute.
but since this dish is really quick dish, and i want to be able to infuse that oil with as much flavor as possible an infused broth, and then i 'm going to have to just do it this way, and i think it works really well, smells great looks.
great easy, i 'm also going to put in a pinch of pepper flakes.
this is meant to be spicy.
but you can put as much or as little as you want, yeah, this sister medium high heat, and this is going to cook for about two minutes, or until the garlic becomes really fragrant and a light golden color not for this i 'm just going to add some white wine if you do n't drink, white wine if you do n't want to use white one if you do n't have white wine you can always use a little bit of water, or you can use some claim juice.
or you can completely omit that.
but you wo n't have like a soupy.
you wo n't have a lot of broth.
but that 's fine.
it will still be delicious.
so you do n't have to worry about that.
so i 'm going to let this cook for about five minutes.
and medium high three to five minutes i wanted to just reduce a tiny, tiny bit, and then we 'll add in our muscles, dallas, greats.
now i 'm just going to see them this with a bit of salt and pepper do n't go crazy with assault because muscles are very salty sunset.
there 's always to taste.
it 's up to you if you like things but salty when you put a little more in there, but like i said it 's up to you.
now , i 'm going to put in our muscles moose glance, as i like to call 'em both was OK.
so now i 'm just going to cover this, let it cook for five minutes turn heat down to medium five minutes or until other muscles open up.
oh , oh, yeah, that is amazing in about five minutes.
even less than that, i would say look at all that little juice, the little brass, no, so amazing.
