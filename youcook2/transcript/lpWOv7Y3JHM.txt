hi guys, it 's angela come from the squishy monster dot com in today.
if you 're wondering more about it, you can check out my blog.
the squishy monster dot com where i will have a human, a of sorts.
so definitely check that out.
but for the purpose of this video i have tried to whittle it down for ease and accessibility.
so you can duplicate this successfully at home, please let me know if you have any questions in the comments.
you my very best to a comedy the very first step is to breakdown your whole napa cabbage into smaller pieces.
and you can chop them up in whatever size.
you like, like five pounds of napa cabbage are just waiting for me to salt it with.
this course, see thought, and i just wanted to show you how thick in granular, it is.
and this is not a brand that i am partial to.
but i just wanted to show you the package.
if his coarse sea salt and you need proper salt to properly thought your kimchi and.
so i 'm just going to sprinkle it all over my cabbage to salted cabbage, you add a paste and the first part of that comprises of a porridge.
but because it needs to cool down i 'm going to go ahead and make it first.
so i need just a couple tablespoons of sweet rice flour.
i like the mochiko band.
and i also source it in the bulk section of my whole food store and my natural food storage, so you can also find it online.
if you 're having trouble as well, and i just want to heat this until gets really nice and thick whisking the entire time.
so you do n't develop.
so ever hear is the texture of the cooked paste.
and you want this to cool down completely.
and it will act as a base to kind of carry all that paste and spread it evenly over your cabbage leaves just a quick view notes before i began blitzing together in my paste on my blog.
i 've gotten a ton of questions like, can you use cayenne powder or bad pepper flakes for this?
you cannot because it will be too spicy.
this is the type of red pepper flakes that you need.
it 's liquid chicago.
again a brand name partial to this is just what was bound at main market today.
but it just wanted you to see it, it does n't have any seeds in it, it 's just dried red pepper powder or flakes.
then , then for my sweetness, my natural sweetness, you can use honey.
but i really like the refreshing and juiciness of an asian pear, and then here is my collection of garlic ginger and onions, and i just split it open to extract any green sprouts that may be hiding underneath of the garlic will chill imparted a bitterness that you do n't want to your kimchi.
i 'm going to tumble in onions.
my garlic and my ginger and then my asian pear that i chopped up in peeled and then i 'm going to wet everything with my fish sauce, and i 'm gonna blitz, it all together.
now so create that ultimate paste that we 're going to massage into our napa cabbage is just a matter of combining all three components together.
so to my cool paste, i 'm going to add in my red pepper flakes, and my pureed veggies and fruit and that all assortment of really nice aromatics and.
now we just have to mix it together until it 's nicely well blended and just set it aside until we 're ready to work with it and do n't worry as always all the ingredients are listed below and at the squishy monster dot com remember to go into your cabbage and turn over the leaves every thirty minutes, or.
so i want to talk about my vegetables and slash additions next.
now , you can see that my cabbage was up to hear before.
but now it 's shrunk all the way down in it.
so it 's soaking into that brian.
in that salt is releasing the excess moisture in the cabbage.
so again do n't forget to turn over the leaves every twenty, thirty forty five minutes, or so.
and it 's going to be a total time of about an hour.
and a half to two hours.
now , i 'm choosing to use just vegetable editions here with some green onions and carrots and some die.
korean , radish, but you can also use water drop word.
it 's also known as chinese or water salary.
baby brine, shrimp raw squid, raw fish, and my favorite route wasters.
but i 'm going to keep it very classic and simple.
i 've just rinsed and drained my cabbage.
and as you can see the leaves bend.
but they do n't break and they 're just very, very soft, and when you bite into it, it should be salty.
but not so much it makes you cringe.
so now all we have to do is scatter in our veggies and our pace and you want to begin working it in.
and i like to put it in batches just like when i make cake and if you 're not used to using pepper flakes, RA on your hands.
i would really recommend using gloves, but for me, it does n't bother me.
we want to toss it around.
you do n't want to squeeze or massage, too much.
you just wanted to toss to coat and this is actually my grandmother 's recipe, and it 's something that i have such fun memories of eating and actually.
remember her having him she that was even up to two years old, and it was just always the most delicious.
here is my kimchi.
and i just wanted to show you how i like to store my nan.
i exclusively stormin in glass stars until the day that i inherit my mothers.
earthenware , which traditionally captain.
sometimes it 's kept underground to store in firm it for years on end.
i will have to make do with mason jars.
so i 'd like to jump start fermentation by leaving it out on the counter top for about a day or two and your nose will know.
it 'll smell very brainy and pickles and will be little bubbles.
that kind of float now you can enjoy this kimchi right away.
of course as well, and i just sprinkled with the garnishes symbol garnish of green onions and sesame E seeds and people love it.
but personally for me, and it 's all a personal preference.
i love deeply fermented, kimchi, which makes amazing stews, an kimchi fried rice.
and you can use it for so many recipes, and i have entire playlist dedicated to that.
so , if you 're interested, you can check out all my kimchi related videos.
so i hope you guys enjoyed this.
