do you like my PO tofu?
let me show you how my wife made it would just four ingredients to full pork.
chili bean sauce and garlic first thing you want to do is get the garlic ready, give these a chopper or a knife to mess it up.
next takes off tofu or in our case, silken tofu and cut it up into small cubes alright.
now let 's put it altogether.
so heat up european at some oil.
we just going to spread the oil around, and they were going to throw in the mince garlic and shortly after that.
we 're going to add in the chili bean sauce and then we 're throwing the ground pork or whatever meat you want or if you want it to be vegetarian, do n't use any meat at all?
here 's the chili bean sauce.
we put in a tablespoon.
you do n't need any salt with this dish because this, this sauce is already salty on its own.
what 's the mean is just about cooked.
you want to throw in the tofu as well, give it a gentle toss.
and then add about a cup of water into it to serve as the sauce for your dish.
all right now it 's time to thicken up the sauce.
so prepare slurry, which is cornstarch and water, mixture, and throw it in the apinan, this gently toss it again until it thickens.
after that, you can add some scallions if you 'd like and a little bit of sesame E oil.
and then you 're done.
one final tip bye, happy.
you guys is this dish is spicy.
so it 's best for adults and may not be appropriate for younger children.
so instead of using the chili bean sauce a good alternative would be black bean sauce, which is also kind assaulted by itself.
but it 's also very flavorful.
as well, thanks for watching and please.
