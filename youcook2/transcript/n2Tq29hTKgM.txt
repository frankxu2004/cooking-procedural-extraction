hi , welcome to chris cooks for you, too.
today , we 're going to be trying my famous macaroni and cheese, and it is really a great dish.
i think you 're going to love it, it 's a lot of added cheese to the dish.
it 's a lot of cheese that pull this a lot of cheese that really gives it that flavor that you actually looking for macaroni and cheese i know, that there 's a lot of versions to macaroni and cheese and some of them are really good.
but if you try this, i think that your family is really going to love it now.
i 've got to get the dish because i 've already buttered for dish.
hi , and i 'm going to bring over here now because macaroni and cheese is a messy dish.
what i 'm going to do be doing today is i 'm going to use a golf.
i have my macaroni that i 've already prepared.
and it 's already loose.
drained so what i 'm going to do is support into my butter dish.
i want to tell you something about this butter dish.
what you do to keep your macaroni from sticking.
OK , you just butter down that you 're going to use, and this is kind of like the large cash flow paint.
so this is only one pound of macaroni car.
so now we have that all in the dish now to the dish i 'm going to tell you what i 'm going to be using today.
i 'm going to use six types of cheese.
one cup of monterrey jack two cups of mild cheddar, one cup of mozzarella, one cup of sharp cheddar, one cup of provolone and one little dish which is really one third of the velveeta cheese, two eggs, two tablespoons of seasoning salt, and you use your favorite seasoning.
so some had some of more saltier than the others i use lori.
so that 's a good season itself for me.
and we actually have a third of a cup of butter now.
of course, we have two teaspoons of sugar.
one cup of half and half an salt to taste so i 'm going to mix all these ingredients in.
so we have the macaroni in the container or in our dish casserole dish into that.
i 'm going to add my cheese OK, and i started out with my mozzarella cheese, and you can put your cheese in any order that 's not going to really make a difference for that.
we 're going to add for two cups of mild cheddar, and you see.
work , on that, a little bit OK.
and to that, we 're going to add the one cup of monterrey jack to that we 're going to add one cup of the sharp cheddar cheese in the dish.
then i 'm sorry to use a bowl and then they mix all of their cheeses and then once they get all their cheeses in, and everything that they 're going to put in, which is the eggs in a crane then they pour it into their casserole dish for me.
i do it this way.
sorry for the following people always calling when you trying to get something done OK.
next we 're going to add to that the provolone cheese.
now what the provolone cheese does as well as the monterrey cheese.
i 'm sorry that the moderate, but the mozzarella what they do is.
you , that pull that you 're looking for when you pick up your cheese i 'm sorry when you pick up your macaroni.
you want to get that cool like a lot of cheese is over in the dish, so what they actually do is get call.
it you 're looking for and i have all of these items in to that.
i 'm going to add two tablespoons of sugar.
now it wo n't make it sweet, but it will kinda balance it out, you know, so you have that it wo n't be too bitter.
it wo n't be too sweet.
it 'll be just right.
so we 're going to mix that in this looks pretty much good enough to eat right now.
OK , so when we get that all mixed in home, and if you can see everything is evenly distributed, we 're going to add to that are butter OK who are butter going to add.
are seasoning salt cool and while we on the salt we 're going to solve it now for me?
that 's not a lot of salt.
and i 'm using sea salt cause i, i 'm sorry.
i 'm using close yourself.
now we have that all mixed together looks good in baking dish already OK and then the final ingredient that we 're going to add those are eggs.
so we 're going to beat are eggs up, and.
because i have the squad warm to destroy without beating that.
and then, the using my opposite hanging and put that in this is like a one dish casserole.
we do n't have to do any cleaning becaus we have everything in the bowl.
the only thing that i would have done differently.
and so i 'm coming out of a bowl.
i would have beat the eggs and have them beat part beaten prior to start.
now once we do that we 're going to add the last ingredient, which is our velveeta, and if you see i put the velveeta all through the mac and cheese and what i 'm actually doing here.
if when you pick up the macaroni and cheese, which are four, they are not only do you have the pool cheese that 's coming from your month.
sarella and it 's coming from your problem, but you also have the burst of cheese.
it 's coming from the velveeta, a velvet is not something that clip with an awfully lot.
but i do use it with the mac and cheese.
OK , last thing we gonna pour in is the one cup of half and half OK half cream, half milk.
now you do n't have to do any staring at that point.
but i 'm just gonna do a little kind of like a old school.
and i said what are you doing to do the state, you know.
what makes your macaroni stick together is going to be your eggs clean this up a little bit and then clean up my working area.
yeah , i 'm going to take this.
i already have my oven preset to three hundred, and fifty and it 's been warming already.
so i 'm going to take this, put it in a three hundred and fifty, or twenty five to thirty minutes and will come back and see how that works out.
now we 're going to take the macaroni and cheese out of the oven.
it 's been that twenty five thirty minutes that i told you that we would need just pull this pan out look at that look at that, that is, gorgeous.
macaroni and cheese as you can see.
it 's bubbling around the side, you can see the velveeta right in there, you can see that has that little like crusty top.
but it 's not hard.
it 's still soft, we 're going to let this sit for a few minutes, OK, which is about five minutes before we cut it, cut, it cut in it just to show you.
what is the weird?
we actually have here.
OK , now i want to show you something.
i 'm not trying to take too much.
but i was trying to see if i could have got some of the pool.
but i ca n't seem to get it up.
i see a little bit of the velveeta, not going to dig down into, you know, the mac and cheese.
but then you see how because we use the butter, see how easy it comes away from the dish, then we 're going to add that to the point.
all right, then, we 're going to go over to the table that we 're going to sample this fantastic and until next time bye.
