hello , number space along welcomes african welcome back to another session with your worship at whatever dot com.
i 'm sure by.
now that you 've got in numerous indian restaurants and choose a non arruti over rice not or roti are usually not in any compliments to any gravy or correct apart from being rich in fiber it is a fact that carries or any dried fried dishes taste different with none then they do with rice or plum.
now usually come in different flavors, they can be a plane on butter.
noun or garlic knots, and can be made with stockings also, but many people i know, believe that you need to make another.
you can always make and you can cook an hour if you do n't have alvin, do n't worry, we 'll make it on the start of two.
so today we will learn how to make this beautiful nice software call.
none to prepare this preparation, you need all purpose flour.
what is all purpose flour all purpose flour is made up, take the little warm water?
the reason why we need warm water is because they 're going to make non with yeast.
OK , here you can buy this quick crazies from the market.
any brand just use one teaspoon of yeast.
what is these east, is acts as a limiting agent?
it makes your non race and become soft.
one of my viewer as, as they can we make naan without yeast.
yes , you can make it without yeast.
you can add baking powder instead of peace.
but remember one thing when you use waiting you 're not get even more brown or faster, and the raising is not as good as the east.
this season, a dormant state so to make it active.
you need to put it in little warm water.
i wo n't make it very active you need to add at teaspoon of sugar.
now this is a basic liquid that you need to make your nob.
but lot of people allowed to add.
milk , they allowed to add yogurt.
you can add anything else to this mixture and also lot of people use egg what the heck does, is it makes your nan rich?
and make it even more software.
so no we are going to use that, because we want to make it for all of a vegetarian friends.
so we will make it eggless.
now do this pressure add some oil bought this mixture liquid and make a solved or see.
we 're not cooking in sound of we 're cooking in the oven, so we are at a disadvantage for two reasons in a tandoor.
the temperature, that is maintained is eight hundred degrees.
fahrenheit , my hour the maximum temperature, that is shown on that is five hundred degrees.
so i put it at a full temperature, and we 're going to make the now so we cannot reach it.
so this is going to take a little longer time to cook in the oven, then if in the thunder it takes one minute in now, and it takes two and half minutes.
so and you want to make your non dope very smooth.
it will be very sticky.
it does n't matter.
make it very, very softly see.
now you look at it my door is sticking.
it does n't matter you want kind of a sticky door, yeah, that 's when you 're not is going to be very, very soft OK.
this , what i 'm going to do.
i 'm going to add a little more oil on top.
i 'm going to cover it and let it rest for like fifteen twenty minutes.
they 're going to make it into a small balls from cooking in thunder, out of made them little bit the door can be little bit more stronger.
but since i 'm cooking it in the hour i wanted to add software as possible, even if it is sticking in my hand.
that 's fine because this way i 'm going to this one guaranteed that i 'll get very good none.
you can cover it up with a cloth with the palm, just, you know, make it stop and look at this dog.
all you have to do is just toss little bit and then this non will become big OK, so now all you do is just pull it little bit.
and then we 're going to put it on the train.
yeah , i put two runs.
so what we 're going to do they 're going to put it in the oven, OK, the temperature has to be maximum in the oven and put it to the closest source of flame or the heat look at this look at this beautiful.
now look at this, you know, once you get them out, you can apply little bit butter.
but look at the non see how easily it can fall and become solved.
but remember, one thing.
see you want to make sure the other side is also could.
so what you do turn it the other side and put it for just like thirty seconds.
now you can see the other side is also.
could , and you and answer pretty much done and look here just take a little bit butter?
apply on top.
and you are butter naan is ready test now, apply some garlic on top bar.
it can easily stick deliver just pull it little bit, once you 're done this fully little bit.
and then once you put it on the tray if you want, just you can stretch it.
their names are stretching it long like this has no increase in the taste.
it is just the way the naked thunder.
but if you want your nans to look that shape, you can make it like this.
i 'm using a nonstick pan so there is no chance of mine.
are sticking to the train.
live far reason, if you 're non is sticking, you can use non stick spray you can buy anywhere parallels just get one of these is just like ninety nine cents on the dollar shop.
now what is a variation of washer in this non preparation.
OK , let me tell you how i love to eat my nan, i applied some garlic to my non.
and i 'm cooking it in when it comes out what i 'm going to do a play little bit butter and sprinkled lady with chat masala, and if there is.
so beautiful, you wo n't believe it.
now look at this by beautiful now.
what i 'm going to do.
i 'm going to apply some butter more than that gender, gender.
ha , ha, ha, both lalalala sprinkle little bit of chat masala, trust me right do n't think these guys are freaky shot why this applied little bit of chat masala to your garlic.
lamb OK, and then take piece by piece.
haha , let 's try other version of non let 's assume that we do n't have the other thing.
i got my full plan here bob.
it 's too hot.
so what we 're going to do.
we 're going to use their kind of a wire mesh on which we 're going to put this none can look at this one while i 'm going to do is just rotate it around the flame, you know, wherever can make sure rotated like this did n't take it into getting chicken type in what we 're doing is real, evenly, distributing the heat.
see this way it cooks, really fast, but hold on.
do n't get too tempted just, very till this little bit can, man, look at this beautiful.
so once you see this, nice balloons up here holy and turn it?
the other side see how beautiful color is.
so now do the same thing.
quickly look at this man, let me pull up the flame now.
OK look at my non stop up now is all you do is apply little butter and your name is beautiful.
you know, all you have to do is check if the nondescript.
if not put, it back, we met this none on the start up and this we made in the oven, the stout of none will remain softer for little longer time.
difference there made non in two ways.
one is on the start up.
one is in the oven, see both of them are soft.
but let me tell you, i think i like the non which is good on the start , up.
garlic naan and little bit charge for solar like the washer with all of this.
i hope that since now, you know, how to make a non in the oven, and even on the south of you will try to make this at home and surprise your family by making this freshly.
