my guy somewhere but alley and visible sort of lowering the kitchen, i 'm going to show you how to make the perfect mashed potatoes.
they 're going to be perfectly cooked with the most luscious combination of heavy milk heavy cream milk butter put together to make the perfect mashed potato super simple and easy to do so.
let 's go ahead and get started now before we get started.
of course, we gotta go over the ingredients, so let 's do it, you 're going to need some new kangal potatoes.
some whole milk heavy cream, unsalted butter salt and pepper that 's it simple and easy, but perfect every single time.
so first thing you want to get a big pot and fill it with water and put a nice general sprinkling of salt in there.
now second do n't turn it on.
because to make the perfect mashed potatoes you gotta start with cold water because, when they when the cold water goes to boiling point that way the potato gets cooked really all the way through evenly, if you put the potatoes in boiling water the very act sign of the potato starts to get cooked right away while the inside has n't had a chance to cook yet.
so that makes it uneven in not very good.
now i 'm using a potato ricer to get these nice and fluffy, which means i do n't need to peel them.
because the potato reiser catches the skin.
so that 's another reason why i love the potato racer.
but if you want, to use this, a regular measure then i will suggest you peel them first and all, i 'm doing is just quartering the really big ones little ones, and then i 'm just going to put these into the boiling water will actually into the water, bring up to a boil and let it cook for about a half hour or so, or until the potatoes are tender now.
if you have n't seen this, yet this is a potato reiser, this will make your life.
a whole lot easier, when you making mashed potatoes.
if you have one of these, because as i 'll demonstrate, you can put your potatoes peeled and everything in.
here i 'll just put a couple of pieces in there so you can see and then you can just pass it through.
there 's no peel in there , right.
it 's all appear see that, that 's going to make your life a whole lot easier.
if i can get ahold of it and get it off.
so i 'm just going to continue passing them all through.
i am a potatoes all period in this bowl now in this little pan.
all i did was i put the heavy cream.
the whole milk and the butter and i just let it warm up.
you do n't want to let it come to a boil.
do n't want to do that?
you just want everything to kind of warm up and the butter to melt, and that 's it now.
it 's a consistency of this is completely up to you.
some people like them really thick and chunky some people like them super creamy loose.
i like it somewhere in between i guess, but, you know, like i said, it 's totally optional.
so i 'm just going to work this in little by little not too much because then it 's going to be difficult to take it out.
if you 've overdone it going to just season it.
you want to season it well.
my mother, my mother would have a heart attack right now because i 'm using black pepper.
she uses white pepper.
but she 's not here.
so i do what i want season.
it with salt because potatoes are just.
very , very bland.
and do n't taste like anything unless you solve them at touch.
more cream and this consistency is perfect for me.
so i 'm going to stop.
but again, you can control, however, you like it.
i 'm just going to put in a bowl.
and we 're pretty much done.
now with thanksgiving run around the corner, you know, everyone 's going to have mashed potatoes, and i know quite a few people were going to make him right out of the box, and i think that, that is tragedy.
because you can make it from scratch, you can make it super easy.
it 's not expensive, and it 's so like how long did it take.
i mean, you really did n't do much.
let it come up to a boil.
they cooked done.
but then between joyce my in town with me to get this recipe and others with WWW dot learning dot com.
next time, bye, bye.
