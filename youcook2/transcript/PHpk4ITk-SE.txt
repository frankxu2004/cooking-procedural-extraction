everyone and welcome to my kitchen in another episode of what 's for dinner.
i recently showed you how to make a carnea, sada, marinade.
and now we 're going to make the carnea, sada.
we 're going to marinate this early in the day, and i 'm going to marinate these all day and then rick is going to throw these on a really hot grill.
and they 're going to take no time at all to cook.
this is thinly sliced sirloin tip, you can see what that looks like and there 's one two three four six slices here and what we 're going to do is, we 're going to take this meat.
we 're going to put it in a zip lock bag.
this is just my preferred method of marination because it 's quick.
it 's easy and it 's convenient and has easy cleanup so you can do this in a glass container, you can do it in a plastic container.
you can do it do not do it in aluminum container.
and then i.
also , have some of the.
i squeeze some citrus to put in my marinade, and i 'm going to go ahead and put the shells right in here with the meat.
and i 'm going to rip some of these oranges, up because they 're kind of big.
and i 'm going to put all of these in here.
because that way i get maximum flavor for my money and this marinade if you have n't watched this video, yet i 'll put a link below to where you can go and watch it is just going to pour this right over i am going to remove as much air as possible from the bag and then just give this a good massage and get all of those flavors really incorporated, and get that.
marinade nestled right in there with all that meat and those citrus shells get those incorporating their do n't be afraid your bag is not going to break just try really hard.
not to break that seal if you do then, you know, you 're going to clean up a little bit.
that 's all alright.
so what we 're going to do now is, we 're gonna just seal.
we 're going to put it in the fridge until it 's time to grill and when it 's time to do that.
we 'll be back and we 'll show, you a trick is going to do with them, hey, it just started to rain.
so were gonna go ahead, and sear.
the saaf inside, and, you know, carnea, sada traditionally done on the barbecue, but, you know, today just did make it, so i have my skillet is smoking hot.
i sprayed it with some oil and these are n't going to take any time to cook.
i 'm not kidding, there.
gonna take like two minutes, just like that.
we let the dust night.
you 'll be able to tell when it 's time to flip it because it 'll easily release from the bottom of the pan is almost there.
and also you 'll be able to see it almost finished cooking on this side, as well.
so i 'm gonna go ahead and turn it, look at that, that is beautiful.
is gonna let that syrup on the second side?
i 'm going to set it afsana different plate.
i 'm going to finish cooking the rest of the saaf and then we 're going to come back, and i 'm going to show you.
what happens next.
hey , we have completed the cooking of all of those pieces of meat and what i 'm going to do now.
i 'm going to show you how he cut it up, 'cause you 're going to want to chop this so that it looks like this.
OK , so it 's easier to eat inside of taco, so here just wipe up a bit OK, my tongs.
this is my jag, normous, you know, serial killer knife that i hardly ever use.
but this is one instance where you can use your butcher knife so rejoice.
if you have a butcher knife, and you never really used it grasp it firmly by the handle like this, OK.
and then what you 're going to do is we 're going to make several chops.
all the way down.
and do n't worry if it does n't cut all the way through 'cause we 're going to write back.
then , we 're going to turn it, and we 're going to drop the other ways so we chop it in tiny little pieces.
OK , and this may or may not be how you do it.
if you are mexican and you have, you know, you are an expert at making carne, assada.
that 's fine, then i 'll be at your channel, and i 'll be looking at how you do things.
but this is how i do him in my house.
i grew up in arizona thirty years, so this is how we do it 'cause it 's quick.
and it 's easy and it 's delicious.
so here we go and we gather him up.
we turn the other way and shop in the other direction, you see any really big pieces you can just hit him with your butcher knife and go from there.
and then you just adam to the rest of the chopped and there you have a plate with two delicious carne, asada tacos, and they have the works.
there 's a little piece of the guy, oh, there 's a little homemade guacamole.
there 's some lettuce and green onions, mexican cheese and then on the side.
here we have i was going to make refried beans.
but i just got too busy and making everything else, and i forgot guacamole salad here with some shredded lettuce and homemade guacamole.
a little tomato a little onion and little dollop of daisy on the top so there, you have it homemade.
carne , asada tacos, even if it rained we did n't get rained out there.
really , really awesome on the grill there really, really awesome in the house and make sure after you chop your meat that you salt it well.
because this meet loves to be seasoned.
so i hope that you try this and i hope that you really, really love it.
