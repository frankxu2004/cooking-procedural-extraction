automate do that to all of them the whole pound, but, i mean, you bowl and then come down with a pound of hamburger meat.
this is eighty twenty chuck, and i 'm going to add it to my bola sausage here.
crankle it all up real nicely.
and when i get it all in here, i 'm going to come in with a few goodies to make it taste good first thing.

we 're going to put an egg in there OK and on top of the egg.
we 're going to add one half a cup of italian bread crumbs, make sure it 's italian.
and then order add one teaspoon of onion powder.
one teaspoon of garlic powder and one half teaspoon of salt.
and now we want to get in here with our fingers.

i wanna mix it up, really, really good, OK and when you get it mixed.
really , really good watch, it a kind of flatten it down where it can be covered with plastic in autumn.
i , but, oh, wait a minute, we done, forgot to put in one of the most important components of this thing, right.
and what is that pepper you can make meatballs without having pepper in it, you know, to mean anyway, so i give up on having clean hands.
and when i 'm done with my fingers, just did a real quick mix, gotta make sure all that peppers, well, distributed within the meat, you know, i 'm saying.
and i got a pretty good.
so then i 'll come out here with the plastic graph like i was telling you earlier.
and put her on there and it got to go in the refrigerator for at least four.
hours , OK, let these all these spices get up marinated to the meat and when you do it 's time to make some baseballs, i mean, have you ever ate olive gardens, meatballs spaghetti.

and i 'm showing you here that are tested.
mine took that they were at one sixty with an internal temperature, ice right about where you need him.
when they come out of the oven.
after that one hour if you know, what i mean, and once you get him to that point and you are satisfied that your meat is done i want you to transfer him into a nice heavy skillet and pour in your favorite spaghetti sauce.
try not to put it on the stove like i did.
OK , and once you get her in there, i want you to take your spoon and move around.
lynam up aurora properly in there where they 'll cook evenly and maybe get a little saw.
