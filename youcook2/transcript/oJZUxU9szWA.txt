they will come to sing and cook by them is shepard, palaran.
i 'm going to show you how to make much holy, and it 'll now.
this is very, very traditionally punjabi.
so i 've been asked many a times to showcase this recipe because i think if you 're a punjabi, you must have definitely had this at home.
but some people who live abroad or have lived all their life probably abroad.
have not tasted the doll or do not know how to make it bring this, this is a very maternal recipe?
what kind of dulls go into making this now this style.
as you see here is split black gram as input jobbie.
we call totemo an in hindi.
we call it dually, we khalida.
so split black gram, an china doll.
this is what we have now.
these two dots need to be taken in a proportion of two third to one third whenever you make this channel should not be too much.
so generally for a family of four i think a cup of dallas good enough so, two third to one third ratio, you will take soak overnight soak them overnight that 's when you can pressure cook them fast if you do n't have a pressure cooker you can cook them faster.
now if you have a pressure cooker what you need to do is.
what 's the dial.
properly then soak it overnight, and put it here when you soak it overnight.
this is how it is like nice and soft and you need to boil this doll with roughly are about four to five cups of water in a pressure cooker, with one four teaspoon of turmeric and salt to taste the first whistle on high flame rest four missiles on low flame boil, it well done until it is well done.
solve some of the doll should be massed , an.
some should remain hold.
the china doll specially would remain almost whole.
but the rest would have almost passed.
so this will take around eighteen to twenty minutes, depending on the flame size of your home who can ticket and if you feel the doll is not cook you can add little water and re cook it, i 've got some doll here, which is boil already.
now the next step is to temper the doll, which is what gets you be actual , fixed.
the beautiful taste comes from temperate, while i could be done there a small trick, which i do generally in hotels when you cook this doll you cook for nearly five, six hours and you feel the test is nice, and when you go to probably his temples, you get this done.
but there of course, it 's this southwick version.
no onions and garlic is used generally only ginger issues.
but what i 'm doing is i 'm cooking homestyle doll the way.
i 've eaten in my house and no oil was used by my mother, she would always had this in key.
so two tablespoons of this, and i remember my father would ask for more when probably he would eat it and bind you.
he used to exercise cycle a lot.
and he lived for more than eight years, so eating he does not mean that you know, you have heart issues.
no , you need to have a lifestyle need to jog you need to run you need to walk up the stairs.
and then enjoy good food, good food cannot be enjoyed by just leading a sedentary life.
remember this key.
let it get hot while the guy is getting hot.
the trick is what i need to show what i do is no take.
some of the doll from an make, a paste out of this grinded, becaus come right back to me chef when i make this doll the water is separate, and the doll is separate in hotels.
everybody keeps cooking for six eight hours until it is nice and pasty.
butt at home, you cannot cook for such a long time.
so this is the trick this lentil.
i will grind it to a pace, so that the consistency is something which you get like a hotel.
so what you need to do is cover this.
remember if you 're grinding it when it 's hot.
you need to be careful covered this.
and then grind it.
that 's about it, it does n't take too much time.
OK , very less time this is now ready and this will give me the consistency.
what is required and what probably you would also be looking forward to now, a pinch of asafetida hang in this?
i like this one tablespoon of garlic about eight cloves of garlic is what you drop an ad.
they 'll get you nice, helpful of garlic.
one tablespoon around one and a half inch of ginger that is chopped so that 's what i 've added.
look at this saute.
the garlic until little brown in the main wild quickly top some cream.
chili 's also three of them if you like it, spicy you can definitely add more well, then goes to green chilies collect needs to be proud of it.
the flavor of key, you know, that 's what adds on to this style.
nice and rich, beautiful now, garlic is almost brown.
i 'll add the onions to this one large onion.
chopped onion i will not prompt i just need to saute the onion until it is nice and translucent.
acts , the sweetness to the doll and the bitterness, i mean, you know, what makes you crack the onion makes you cry when it is raw.
once it is sorted it 's nice and sweet.
i 'll saute until it is nice and translucent.
an that 's when becomes sweet.
roughly about two minutes after about two minutes next thing, one large tomato chopped goes into this.
i do n't prefer adding the puri, i prefer it top.
that 's what i have seen.
my mother loop so chopped also brings in the colour out, an of course, the specs of commander is what i like sort of.
this , how you see thirdly, you have too much of the tempering now, that 's very, very important.
tempering is something which is very important for dolls.
what i 've seen is most dolls have different temporaries.
usage of different ingredients, and it changes with each stop and with each region in india.
it changes so in probably not they 'll be usage of azure, florida, in twitter, pradesh usage of him will be higher.
an usage of commandos will be very less usage of probably, you know, coriander is not so much in lentilles like black dial and all that.
he is probably an integral part used everywhere.
so it 's a mix of blend, you know.
somewhere you have round chili 's used whole chilies, used only green chilies used only cuban and garlic used.
so that 's what makes and the moment you change your state or probably with each region there 's a slight change in the habits with my experience.
i 've seen that black lentol probably not so much used in the east, an down south.
also wear yellow.
lentil is used quite a lot.
so that 's also because of geographies and metabolism of people.
i have seen people generally turn on digest doll in the east, and south of india.
so easily so again.
geographies , mataba, lism of human beings.
this is looking good.
now i 'll add the dry spices.
kashmiri chili powder, one teaspoon of this brings in the color in the dark, nice color little bit of turmeric not too much, very little, some garam, masala.
at this point of time, half teaspoon actually, i 'll tell you at my home.
my mother would make a wholesome garam, masala, which was the only ingredient that food go apart from little bit of virtually.
so that 's what i 've seen her.
do that, garam, masala would have had too much of coriander cumin so it was a hold?
some kind of thing so that 's what i saw salt at this point of time.
i 'm not adding was you add it to the doll you will check after you add the doll.
if you require salt, then you add.
look at this suddenly, looking nice and bright becaus of the kashmiri chili powder time.
get the real grabber field and which is what.
actually , we all remember all memory is probably the best memories in india.
we have is eating on the road size on the highway 's got a lot of these highway and have us the restaurants.
and now i 'm going to add this lentil in here and the magic.
look at this, this is the magic you 've seen this.
the paste inside got some key in this spoon.
add into this measure, no wastage look at this stuff.
beautiful , fantastic look at this is very, very homestyle.
let me tell you this easier so that you can enjoy a great piece of north indian lenten as we say.
march , holier little, i 'll quickly have a taste of this salt, if required, will add salt?
you see, before i test.
i 'm a show you this, the thickness of the doll becaus, you made a paste of part of the doll.
there 's no water separation.
anne , this, you will need to cook, of course.
but they 'll be do water separation as most people said, you know, whenever they cook is almost water separation happening that we taste this i think a little bit salt required to salt goes in here sing dumb dance and add salt.
this is my energi, energi of food and as i say, the maximum, you know, now what i do yeah, so this is what you require to do.
look at this, now if you require a great piece of doll cover this.
now you need to cook this dial for fifteen minutes, more.
and keep stirring in between at the end of fifteen minutes will see that as you quote the dial on the back of the spoon will get a nice layer.
and that 's when the dallas ready.
that 's the time, you know that you have to serve the dial immediately.
but if you keep it overnight, it 's going to again and not become a big lump, the next day.
if you want to use it had a bit of hot water and then we hit and use it.
but at that point of time, check this sort here after about fifteen minutes, you see the doll look at this, my sent a homogenous ann.
i must tell you that i was studying in between continuously so that you could get a great consistency so that 's what.
even you have to do in between.
you need to remove the lid and keep studying so that the dial becomes nice and homogenous.
and now you see there 's no water separation here, tall is ready to eat what we need to do is as i was showing.
you quotes well on the back of a spoon like this, it 's ready and it 's home style.
do in hotels, little more thicker, but at home, this is fine?
and you can enjoy a great test for this all you need to do is.
wow look at this nice consistency.
this is beautiful.
lastly , if you do n't add this, you do n't enjoy it now.
one teaspoon off this little bit of fresh coriander.
if you want to personally not my favorite, though i 'll just put a sprinkle of this on the side here and that 's what it is.
it 's all ready to eat, if you want to add one teaspoon of this style you need to jog OK next day morning.
you need to wake up and job do n't blame me for good food.
i 'm here to cook good food, you need to jog after beating the star that 's when you enjoy good food and if you want to enjoy good food.
follow this recipe.
go for a job and live a healthy life.
