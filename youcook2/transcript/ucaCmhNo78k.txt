so my oven is preheating to three hundred and fifty degrees.
i 'm going to mix up my hash brown casserole in the nine by thirteen pan, which is what is going to be baked in.
because i do n't have a big enough bowl to mix everything.
so this does make kind of a lot.
so be forewarned, i 'm going to add in one can of cream of chick in soup.
i 've seen some recipes online call for cream of mushroom soup.
it is not cream of mushroom.
it is cream of chicken and to this, i 'm going to add a quarter of a cup, which is half a stick of melted margarine.
you can use butter if you so choose however.
cracker barrel does not at that end next step is my cheese.
this is two cups of colby cheese that has been put into the food processor and chopped up fine.
it is an eight ounce block of colby cheese, almost all the recipes i 've seen online call for cheddar, an cracker barrel, does not use cheddar.
they use colby, which is why a lot of times it does not taste exactly like cracker barrels.
it may be close, and it may be very good in its own right.
a lot of recipes call for sour cream cracker barrel does not put sour cream in there.
so i 'm not going to in mind.
next up is half of an onion that has been diced up and then finally if you want this more like cracker barrel you 're going to add more salt than i do but, i add half a teaspoon to this.
there 's plenty enough salt in the soup, too, as well, as the cheese to salt everything.
but and then half a teaspoon of black pepper.
now i 'm just going to mix this up until it 's well combined.
now this is all mixed up going to add in my ash browns.
i 'm using frozen shredded hash browns that have been thought.
you do n't want to use frozen, and how we use two pounds with hash browns.
unfortunately , these bags come in twenty six ounce size.
so i 'm going to use one full bag and about a handful are potatoes out of another bag, and i 'm going to do something that they even do in the restaurant make sure you have clean hands and just mix this up until all of the hash browns are covered with your sauce mixed well, and once you get that all mixed up.
go ahead and wash your hands, make sure you put it out, it 'll even, even layer you do n't want to match this down.
you do n't want to compress.
it just leave it kind of loose, but make it take up the entire pan.
and now i 'm going to put this in my preheated of it again.
three hundred and fifty degrees fahrenheit four forty five to fifty minutes just until it starts bubbling and starts to get a nice crust around the edge.
an when that time is, up, i will be back and after it comes out of the oven.
this is what it will look like you want to go ahead and let this rest for about ten minutes, or so, before you dive into it, if you really want it, like cracker very all, go ahead and let it sit for a half hour.
forty five minutes.
and it will get to be the exact consistency of cracker barrel 's hash brown casserole, but anyway, that is, how you make hash brown casserole cracker barrel style.
hope you guys enjoy.
and , thanks so much for watching.
