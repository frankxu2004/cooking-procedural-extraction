hi , my name is rula and welcome to eating with rula today.
we 're going to make a delicious cheap pizza called homeless, or as you may know, it hummus this dish is nutritious, and as i said very delicious and can be served with anything kabob through any other means issue, would like it to be served X two?
or you could have it as an appetizer if your friends call you last minute and they decide to come.
it 's quick and easy to make, and i promise you they will love it as much as you so why do n't we get started.
first thing is i use a food processor because i prefer because it grinds the chickpeas very well, so that it 's fine.
i 'm good how most to me should be fine and smooth, smooth like butter, i should n't taste or i should n't feel.
i should say the little bits of chickpeas that you can have if you 're not using a good food processor.
if you do n't have a food processor then by all means use your blender.
next thing we 're going to need is one can of chickpeas fifteen point five ounce, can of chickpeas?
we 're going to dump it into the food processor.
there is no rhyme or reason to how you make this and plop in all the ingredients in here and put it on an.
that 's how quick.
and that 's how easy it is the.
next ingredient is the has half of one lemon of freshly squeezed lemon juice.
but it in there garlic, we 're going to put one small clove.
and if you like it garlicky, that 's something we 'll discuss later so small.
clove of garlic a third of a cup of water.
one quarter of a teaspoon of salt and the last ingredient which i think is one of the most important ingredients is teinit tina.
is a sesame E paste made of ground sesames, you can find tina in any middle eastern store?
mediterranean store now when you open up your bottle, obtaining you 're going to notice that there is a thick layer of oil on the top.
you want to take the same tablespoon that you 're going to need for the homeless, and you 're going to stir it around to make sure that your oil is well incorporated into the sesame E paste.
once you do that we 're going to take nine tablespoons of tana make sure your tablespoons are filled and just dump it on there seven.
eight and nine teen, a if you put too much, it 's usually not a problem or, if you put too little it 's not a problem so, do n't ever be afraid of that, and then that 's it you 've put all your radiance that you 're going to need for this into your food processor or blender what i 'm going to do.
now is i 'm going to put the food processor on and leave it on for about two to three minutes.
because i want my humble smooth.
the smoother as i said the better.
so i 'm going to leave it on.
i do other things in the kitchen, and then i 'll come back to you and come back to it.
and we 'll see how this sucks about done, and it 's perfect.
just the consistency you want right here, what i want you to do at this point is i want you to try your homeless.
because you should see if no perfect for me.
if you want more salt, lemon garlic artena, i think you 're going to love it as it is.
but i also want you to remember the reason, why i 'm asking you to try it also is.
because food is a blessing.
it is a gift.
it is such a pleasure and you should enjoy eating as much as i do.
and that 's why i want you to try it and make it taste as good as can be.
so you 're happy with what you 're eating OK.
but that said we 're going to take the sign over to here.
and i 'm going to put this one two this appetizer platter, you can really put your harmless on anything.
but i chose this to show you how i would serve it.
if i had guests coming over, so right here, i have some pita chips, some pita chips that i made.
and you can watch my video on how to make these pita chips.
they 're very easy and delicious.
so we take our home most and we 're going to put it here on our ladder spread it out a bit and then be prepared to feast.
so i 'm going to decorate it a little bit, i, i put some chick peas aside.
just so i could decorate my homeless a little bit, and i put it on top.
then , i add a little bit of color paprika it does n't give any taste just some color to your homeless, i could n't come out and then you 're set, you have a gorgeous platter of hummus and pita chips.
but if you prefer by the way, not to have pita chips and you want just pita bread you can do that as well.
i think either one it tastes delicious and also again back to the whole thing of making what you like.
try your harmless as is without, you know, how we prepared it here and see how you like it.
then what i want you to do is take your olive oil because you can serve it with or without olive oil.
it is no right or wrong way put it here on the corner of the hammers, and try it and see how you like it with olive oil which is amazing, and i wish you could come over and eat with me.
this would be so much fun.
it 's delicious, it 's really delicious, and as i mentioned it 's quick.
it 's easy and it 's a wonderful, wonderful appetizer or side dish that will please all your guests.
so , thank you for joining me today.
