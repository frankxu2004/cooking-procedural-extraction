hey there and welcome to no recipe required i 'm dave and tonight.
i 'm going to show you how to make a version of my mother 's tacos.
i 'll call him ground beef tacos.
now i 'm making chicken tacos.
fish tacos steak tacos all the time.
beef is not really something i go to all that much, but i tell you when i do.
i absolutely love it brings me back to my childhood.
an it 's a dish.
i absolutely love i think you will too let 's show you how to do.
OK , we 're going to start our beef tacos by browning off beef, and i 'm using a mixture of twenty percent, lean and ninety, percent or ninety.
three percent lanes and for no other reason that i like kind of a fat and some of the flavor and that fattier meat and i 'm just going to lay it into my hot pan here, and i 'm just kind of break it up and let it all cook down.
and , while this happens, we can go ahead.
you do n't have your vegetables chopped up.
this is a great time to do it.
you just want to move.
this around let it cook for two or three minutes, then give it a good stare.
make sure it 's getting cooked all the way around.
so , after my meat is browned off.
i like to remove it with a slotted spoon.
it 's an easy way.
there 's a few different ways to take off the.
meat , and separate it out from the fat, and i do n't need all that, that in the taco meat.
so once i get this done going to drain off most of it, and we 're going to come back and start, start, sauteing awesome dentistry off all my meat and most of the fact that was in the pan there i left a little bit 'cause i need to sate my vegetables now.
i 'm throwing in a full a pepper.
i have to be using a pesio pepper which is not all that hot, got a little bit of heat to it, you can use whatever you want, though how opinion is a great, even red bell peppers green bell.
peppers are quite nice.
i 'm just going to let these cook down over.
like medium, medium high, keep you want some salt and pepper in there and go until the onions become translucent and nice and soft.
so once are pepper and onion is nicely cooked down, like i said, it 's often translucent.
we 're going to add, are spices now?
my kind of lead spice is cumin in this dish.
when i use a good amount.
remember , we got all that ground beef to season, and i think one of the keys here is to use the spices in the, i can hear getting toasted a little bit, it really helps bring out the flavor.
so there was a couple tablespoons of cumin couple.
maybe a tablespoon of chili powder half a tablespoon of oregano and just a few dashes 'cause mine is really hot of cayenne pepper, and i 'm just going stir those in.
and let that let the like i said, this place is closed action.
i 'm going to add a little bit more maybe go half again more other half a tablespoon of, of chili powder, another half tablespoon of cumin.
let 's add some salt again.
we gotta solve all that beef and some pepper have just let these go for about five minutes, in less than five minutes, three or four minutes.
OK , sorry, i just gotta finish, adding my tomato paste an as it 's going in just want to give it a quick stir and just like the spices i liked allow that tomato paste to cook down for three or four minutes over medium heat and that kind of cost trace.
the flavor deep and dark as the, and it 's going to end up getting you a better result on taco meat.
so i 'm gonna let that go start every once in awhile and make sure nothing is burning nothing sticking too badly, and i will come back when it 's time to add the beef back.
so after a few minutes, i 'm going to turn my heat back up then i 'm going to add in that ground, beef that we brown earlier and i 'm just going to mix and stir everything together and get it incorporated alright last couple ingredients secret weapon, my mom secret weapon, a little bit of catch up probably not the most traditional.
but adds a little bit of sweetness, little bit of vinegar and tartness, which is super nice and about a teaspoon or tablespoon of honey, and i 'm going to add a couple nice keep in tablespoons of your favourites salsa we 're going to mix all this together, and we 're actually going to add in about a cup maybe cup and a half of water and most of that water is actually going to evaporate off as this cooks.
but i like to get it in there.
so that kind of all the spices and everything would guide in there has a nice kind of fluid way to incorporate all the flavors that have been kind of brought together.
so far and once i get this fully mixed together i 'm going to turn the heat to low, i 'm going to put the cover back on i 'm just going to let this kind of simmer on low heat for about twenty minutes.
so after fifteen to twenty minutes, you want to pull it off give it a quick stir you want to give it a quick taste for seasoning this one yeah, i could use a little bit more, salt you little bit, more pepper.
now you can, you can let it go as is, or you can serve it as is it 's totally, totally good if you want, a little dryer just go ahead and cook it like another ten minutes or so, with the lid off and you cook it more that water will evaporate i think this is just fine and dandy.
let 's go ahead and serve it OK.
let 's go ahead and play are tacos ground beef.
this is basically just like my mom used to make probably like a lot of us, used to have probably not super traditional, but absolutely super delicious.
toppings , you want i like maybe a little sour cream on line, use.
then , certainly, a little cheese little bit of lettuce and you are good to go.
i 'll see you next time on no recipe required.
