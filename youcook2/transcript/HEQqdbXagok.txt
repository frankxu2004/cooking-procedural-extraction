hey , everybody today i 'm going to show you how to make some super crispy fried chicken southern style like you wanted to do is what i 'm using here is some wings and some bad and leg quarters.
OK , all you do is get you knife chopping babies up real good.
careful do n't cut yourself and never wanna see, some salt pepper, garlic powder is what i is.
and then i tossed them real good in the bowl with my hand is tossed the bowl up and down and then i do the other side.
exactly the same way once i get that done.
i 'm going to put in two cups of regular greek, yogurt.
you might think watt, yeah, yeah, they 've been doing this for years.
regular greek yogurt rubber down in there, get her all mixed in there.
the best you can and when he got it in there, i want you to fill the rest of the hot up with whole milk, OK, just regular whole milk, you do n't have to have buttermilk and all that stuff and we 're going to go just like i did with my fish if you saw that video we 're going to go in the refrigerator for six hours, i mean, you got the time do it in the morning, let it sit it 's tenderizing it, it 's making all those flavors get in there it 's going to make it.
so crunchy and delicious OK there 's why it looks like six hours later, now, once you get out, i do n't knock anything off i, just kind of move it around, make sure thing got good, and soaked and then i go over here, and i throw me about two or three cups of regular all purpose flour in a pan or bold as you can see, and there is one whole tablespoon of sea salt and one whole tablespoon of garlic powder anna bunch of black pepper, you can put as much of that owners you want to and i also add cayenne you can add more cayenne right there for a more spicier chicken this is pretty mild kids can eat it, you know, what i 'm saying like this.
so you want to stir it all up really, really good there and make sure take the time to get in there and completely mix it.
because that is the taste that your chicken is going to have when you bite into the crust and.
now i come straight out of the yogurt and go straight into the flour mixture i do n't do a lot of shaking offer nothing i just kind of move it like that ceterum side over there and i 'll get another piece here and show you just like.
so that 's one of the wings without a leg on it there, i mean, without that little flap that 's totally useless i will do it for you OK, i think i got me a leg here coming up next, oh, yeah, where are your leg hair it is OK.
now do my leg, and, once you get all your pieces, coated you 've got to have ha told y'all do n't go in with no cold all it 's got to be three hundred and seventy.
five degrees alright now once you know, it 's three hundred and seventy five degrees.
i , once you take a chick in, be careful and put it in the oil OK just like.
so and when you get about half of that amount of chicken that i was cooking there in your pot do n't touch.
it do n't touch it until it starts to get a nice color to it, you know, i 'm saying, i mean, it needs to be some brown message.
you can see.
OK , like that, they start to turn brown now once you reach in there.
and just kind of touch him around.
a little bit do n't do anything major and what you 're trying to do at this point.
is make sure that none of your pieces of chicken are stuck together?
and this is, this is getting browner and browner as you can see and remember, this is i fast forwarded this.
so you do n't see all the cooking, it used to be that color.
this , where i like, mine right there that color i take it out this time serve it up folks OK.
but i take it.
what i do is i take it from there and put it on a paper towel on plate drain it.
and then service where you go where everybody there it is my juicy.
