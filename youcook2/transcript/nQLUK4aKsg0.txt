have leftover mashed potatoes from dinner, turn them into breakfast favorite, using this recipe for my crispy mashed potato pancakes OK?
let 's get started add two cups of cold mashed potatoes to a bowl.
be sure, there.
otherwise , the pancakes will turn out a bit bland to the potatoes.
add two lightly beaten eggs.
one tablespoon of flour and an eighth teaspoon of garlic powder.
if your mashed potatoes are on the wet side, add a bit more flour here.
will also add in one cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and stir everything together?
ready to cook, add one tablespoon of vegetable oil to a nonstick, skillet over medium high heat, while the oil is heating up shape, the mashed potatoes into one pancake the size of the skillet this is done quite easily.
using a lightly oiled dinner plate carefully slide the pancake onto the heated oil and lightly press the top with a spatula to flatten out evenly try making individual sized pancakes.
if you wish cook the pancake covered until the bottom is crispy about ten minutes.
if you want to crisp up the top side as well slide the pancake back onto the oil plate cover it with another plate and flip just like this, then slide it back into the skillet and cook for another three to five minutes.
now will slide the pancake into a large platter and cut into wedges.
this is super easy.
