hi guys, and laura vitali, and this episode of learning kitchen i want to share with you.
one of my favourites when i call fancy sandwich is it something that make once in awhile for my husband, and i and it 's a real treat.
but i love getting this anytime, you go to like a french cafe, or french.
it 's a croque monsieur.
it 's really a french ham and cheese sandwich, not to be confused with the monte cristo.
that 's a different kind of sandwich.
is , this is different?
which i often hear people confuse the two.
this is equipment, you recipe in a different video.
i will show you how to make a monte crystal, but the ingredients will need are n't very many, you know, not any fancy ingredients will need some.
i 've got some swiss here, but you could use gree air.
and i 've got some hand.
this is just deli ham and some swiss cheese.
and you will need some time in china journal nutmeg butter flour milk salt, and pepper dijon mustard and some bread.
i 'm using my homemade honey.
we bread because it is hardly enough to send up to this dish, gives it a touch of sweetness with the salty cheeses and the salty ham.
incredible combination, it really, it 's amazing so but traditionally use a white bread or like a rustic french bread.
but that 's what i 'm using.
i use different kinds of right all the time depending on what i have on hand.
what i decided to bake that week or whatnot.
so that 's what i 'm using now.
i 've got my oven, preceded or preheating over about four hundred degrees.
and now what i 'm going to do.
i have a baking sheet that i 've lined with some aluminum foil and what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to brush a little bit of melted butter on both sides of my bread post.
this and want the bread to be toasted because i feel like it holds up to the sandwich, much better want to test it when it 's toasted.
so i 'm just going to brush it on both sides with some butter 'cause it gives it, not only great flavor.
but it also helps get nice and golden brown do that on both sides, not good.
i used up all my butter.
OK , i 'm going to pop this into the oven for about ten minutes, or until it 's really beautiful, lovely.
and toasted and most likely going to flip it halfway through we just keep my eye on it and flip it, if i need too, just to make sure both sides or golden brown and toasted in his little saucepan.
i 've got my butter melting.
i 'm going to add to that.
my flower right now what we 're making is a really quick b√©chamel.
so really quick and easy cream sauce, because traditionally monte cristo has basham out with it now do n't think to yourself.
i 'm not going to go through all that trouble for a ham and cheese sandwich.
this literally takes minutes to do, and it 's a total treat something that i would make for the weekend or something like that, and i just added my milk and the flower is stored in clumps.
but once it everything heats up, it gets to everything melts, and it is perfect.
and it really is one of the most delicious fancy sandwiches.
my husband and i absolutely love it.
i love this with the phrase, a salad with some lord, owns.
and maybe even a poached egg if i 'm feeling fancy.
but have not feeling like doing a poached egg maybe i 'll do a quick madame, which is equipment , sir.
with an egg on top i 'll show you that in a different episode, but it 's delicious whoops.
i 'm just going to let this cook until since i 'm waiting for that flower to pretty much melt completely.
this should n't take very long at all.
it 's looking good, it 's nice and thick.
i 'm going to add my grid parmigiano.
i just greeted sometime i jonah journal, actually going to turn it off and now, i 'm going to add some salt and pepper and A touch of nutmeg easy under nutmeg.
because it can go from fliches to pumpkin pie space it is a pretty strong space.
so you want to make sure that you got kind of late on it.
but it says, i think add a world of a difference to you cream sauce.
OK , stir that in it 's going to be nice and thick, is especially now that you 've added your cheese is really thick?
i 'm going to set this aside, check on my bread, get it out and assemble and we are really close to eating actually, my brightness, and toasted.
so now we 're ready pretty much to assemble.
i 'm going to take some dijon mustard.
i love dijon mustard.
i really, really do and i specially love dijon mustard, when it comes to ham and cheese.
i just think it 's a fantastic.
it just like a match made in heaven.
i have to say that dijon mustard, and like coarse ground mustard, or my favorite.
so i 'm going to put a good layer on one of the pieces of bread, you can do both.
if you want, does n't matter just going to do a one piece of bread 'cause i do n't want to be too, too strong.
and then i 'm going to take some swiss.
i do once ice in the cutters in half like that, and then you take your ham and do a couple slices of ham.
because these are really thin slices, which by the way that 's how i 'd like it if you can chat, with your deli person, which you should be able to you.
can tell them.
listen cut my hand a little bit thinner because i do n't like it to be too thin even now.
i 'm using a couple slices.
i really do feel like the flavor is better if it 's dinner and just put a couple more sizes on there that newt originally thought you were going to use hope that makes sense.
and then i 'm going to put the other slice of cheese on the top so it 's two slices and two slices.
and then i go ahead and put top now.
this is a knife and fork sandwich.
this is not a pick up with your hands and eat kind of sandwich now.
our sauce has gotten really thick because it 's been sitting here while the bread was toasting.
but that 's what it does, and once it goes into the oven, which by the way at this point i had my broiler , preheated.
i 'm going to put some of my sauce on here.
it is full of parmigiano, which you guys.
now i love i 'm just going to smear this, like so and it looks weird, but trust me.
it is heaven in your mouth as soon as this comes out of the oven, it really is it gets hot.
and it 's bubbly and it 's just fabulous.
then you take more pics, cheats like so i 'm going to pop this under the boiler do n't put this directly under the broiler.
i actually put this on my lower rack.
so it 's kind of almost like the furthest away from the boiler.
so that i can stay in there a little bit longer to get everything heat up.
and then once the cheese is bubbling, it 's melted in its golden brown were ready to serve in there 's it.
but it is telling you this is that the word worthy that 's how good the sandwiches and it really is in a sandwich 'cause you need a knife and fork to eat it i just saw these out of the oven and look at that mean that is just perfection i 'm going to cut into this.
so that you can see.
it is cheesy.
it is just glorious, very hot.
those point, but if anyone will risk eating a hot sandwich for you guys this check, let me get a bite of this.
oh , i ca n't wait.
mean look, look at the ham with cheese look at the bubbling assume top.
it is perfection.
give me a second up because this is really hot blow.
by then, i saw, that is money salty, but not true saltine is cheesy and creamy on the top.
the brightness, and toasted sorry really holds the shape really, really well, and that mustard it 's just it 's amazing that is, definitely a sandwich, sandwich fit for company that a large indication come look at this recipe i hope they enjoy spending time with me eyes.
and i will see you next time.
