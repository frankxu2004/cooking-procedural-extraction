hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with the potato pancakes one of my favorite potato preparations and something.
i just do n't make often enough super easy to make take two pounds after i had tuna quarter, two pounds of russet potatoes peeled them.
and then great them with a cheese grater into a bowl of very cold water.
and i 'm also going to great in half an onion into the same bowl and by the way, you 've never cried until you 've created onion.
it 's a good cry right once.
i 'm going to add some more water filled up a little more, and these are just going to sit in the cold water for about twenty thirty minutes, you do n't need to rinse it just lemme sit there in the mean time take a couple eggs some flower black pepper little pinch of cayenne salt, of course, and we 're going to wish that up until very smooth and then set that aside replicated already drain them rinse them put him in a calendar and squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze all the water must be squeezed out.
so i squeeze it a fistful at a time.
and , then i pressed again with some paper towel make sure all the waters out of potatoes.
it 's the only way to screw this up is to have web potatoes.
once the potatoes are as dry as humanly possible, add them to a bowl mix in your egg mixture with a spatula.
and , that is a potato pancake mixture ready to fry easy recipe.
i told you i 'm going to cover that while they make these 'cause you do n't want any air to get to the potatoes if possible as they do oxidize, is not something you could store?
and it 's going to be good the.
next day, going to want to make this stuff fresh right.
now to fry these we 're going to use a heavy duty skillet with a good amount of oil you, they say a quarter inch oil i do n't know if you can quit need that much on the bottom but, you need enough oil to come up this side at least.
halfway up the pancake, if you want a nice crispy cake this one i 'm just doing a little test to taste for salt.
we 're going to heat the pan on medium high hot edger, pancake mixture flatted out.
this one is a little smaller than the one.
you 're going to see, but again, i 'm just tasting for steam going to taste this, oh, man, so good.
and it did need a little more seasoning.
so what you want to do you want to put your oil in the pan heat to medium high when it starts to shimmer, azure potatoes, flatten down a little bit.
they do n't have to be around, who says that to be around if i said it once.
i 've said it a thousand times.
the kitchen is no place for perfectionist.
flag him down to about a half inch cooking for about like i said, five minutes per side the, the edges get really crispy and crunchy before you turn him five minutes on the other side, and when i flip, am normally i 'll turn it down to medium.
because this is raw potato you gotta give it time to cook through if you keep going on high heat or medium high the whole way sometimes towards the end?
the edges start.
getting a little too brown in the middle is n't quite tender enough and there.
you go i top mine with smoked salmon sour cream, and dill very classic combination, you could do this with applesauce and sour cream.
another even more classic combination plane next to some eggs and bacon anyway go to the site, the ingredients for the filling are quite important so go.
check those out and as always enjoy.
