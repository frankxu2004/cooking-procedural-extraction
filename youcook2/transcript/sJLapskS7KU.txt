big ice of jason hill here an i 'm with jacks, khalfani from the cooking with jack show, jack, on the go burger wars how many channels do you get on youtube.
now cool, cool , cool.
right now we 're on chef tips.
ron chef tips.
and i 'm going to show jack how to make the juicy lucy burger, and there 's a couple of different ways you can do it.
that 's going to do to more traditional way with our classic american cheese.
i 'm going to do a little gourmet version with some fresh buffalo mozzarella, so let 's get started.
got a pound of ground, beef.
each , and it 's eighty twenty.
so that means it 's a little bit more fat than your lean ground beef.
but it just makes it taste better, yeah, yeah, i mean, you ca n't going to burger see.
people say i 'm.
fat , i just briefly taste better.
i do n't know what your problem is.
but i think if you 're going to do a really good burger you 've got to have a little bit of the fat in there to get that flavor.
so what i 'm going to start with jack is, i 'm going to go ahead and start forming one patty.
ann you can grab, maybe a third of this pound that you got going third of it and try and just flat out as thin as possible.
that 's probably good right there.
yeah , so, let 's go ahead and get that on your cutting, board, and just flatten it out.
shape it up into a around patty.
and we want to go a little big on these 'cause they 're going to shrink up cousin, the fat content.
they 're going to shrink.
and you do n't want to open up your butt and go.
so we want a nice and big.
so they fit right on the button, although with patty, patty exactly OK.
so you want to grab about the same amount that you did before maybe not quite as much, and make another patty.
so the smaller one is going to be our kind of our lid.
yeah , then we 're going to seal the edges OK at this point.
i would like to take a little kosher salt sprinkled from the heavens.
little pinch on each one oh, nice you go to church, too cool.
and then we 're going to hit it with some fresh cracked pepper.
i ca n't say enough about his home.
this writer grinder, yeah, i love this thing.
and i ca n't remember where my wife got it.
oh , yeah, i know how steps are.
they get really weird my secret evil secrets exactly.
so it 's probably best that i breakings in four yeah, break him up a little bit, overlapping keeping the sinners best as possible.
so you do n't want the cheese to lose out on the side when we 're cooking no right like that, yeah, if you want more, feel free to whatever you think, you know, if you want to put another slice and then go for it, alright i 'm good at this ninja two more pieces there alright.
here we go like that, nice get this press mozzarella in.
here yours looks better.
i , gotta, i gotta, upstage a little bit.
now let 's take your season side and put it down over the cheese.
and now we 're going to seal this guy up just kind of pinch the edges.
'cause like i said, if you lose all your cheese during the cooking, then we just message the whole thing.
you mean, kids can really do this.
oh , yeah, art, class, and then finally i just like to season the top with a little more salt.
just a little bit little more pepper, nice and anybody can change any of these steps like a different seasonings.
right , oh, yeah, whatever you like to season your burgers with, i mean, you know, if you want any season saw that you prefer any cheese that you prefer any blue cheese would be awesome.
in this thing.
yeah , you put in there.
yes , yeah, that 's a beautiful OK jack.
we 're going to do these on the grill, you can do these on your stove top and a pan.
if you want i 'm standing in snow, yeah, i have n't shoveled my deck yet.
sorry about that was the first time i 've ever barbecue in the snow is n't it cool.
we will make a snowman afterwards do for my burger.
i 'm going to go ahead and put these tomatoes on an.
I have a video already on these grilled tomatoes, you can check the link there if you want a recipe there all marinated look at them.
yeah , balsamic vinegar, olive oil basil.
everything i love about being italian.
garlic shallot, puree, yeah, i got the grill on high and i like to cook the burgers to medium come on, get off later.
mine does n't wanting more.
and then also let 's go and put some onions on here.
and i grilled onions, yeah, oh, dude, i love everything.
if it 's not moving all eat it.
i just put a little olive oil on those.
they 've been here for a couple minutes.
i 'm gonna go ahead and give him a quarter turn.
so far cheeses staying inside.
that 's what we wanted alright.
i 'm going to turn him after about three minutes on each side look at that.
oh , my starting to come apart a little bit that 's alright as long as the cheese does n't come out oh, look at that it looks beautiful dude.
nice work, well, thanks for your, we 're almost done close the lid look at that, oh, yeah, pretty much close to medium if these nice and charred were almost ready look at that can that keep him upside the most the time and then right before i pull moth.
