hey , everybody welcome back to my channel today, i have an incredible treat for you guys.
i used to work at a steakhouse that did these little lobster corndogs, and this morning for some reason mean rachel woke up with this hankering for corn dogs.
so we went down to the mall, picked up according to stick, and just sort of popped into my head that i used to make these lobster corndogs almost every single day for like a year straight so.
i figured why not share this recipe with you guys.
it 's going to absolutely blow your mind.
corn dogs or incredible already filled with lobster.
and you have a total E really, elevate the idea of a corn dog to the.
next level, so with that said.
let 's go in the kitchen and show you guys how to make these lobster corndogs.
so in this recipe, i 'm using fresh lobster tails straight from the store.
and it 's really important.
they used freshly cleaned lobsters because frozen lobster tails tend to stick to the shells after their cooked.
and that will prevent a clean removal of the meat.
so , once you 've tide details together with limited butchers, twine or just plain old string.
get some water on a rolling boil, and you 're going to cook the tails for about ten minutes.
and the class for around seven.
so after you 're finished boiling the lobster, you 're going to quickly grab a bowl of ice water and place all the lobster meat in this ice water, which is going to shock the meat and cool it down.
so it does n't overcook so once the lobster is completely cooled down, remove it from the bath.
and they 're going to start to take the shells off with just a little bit of.
pressure , a cloth and some careful handling.
so when you come to the cloud, the lobster the first thing, you want to do is remove the knuckle.
after that take the bottom pincer off and then wrap takla in a towel and give it a few smacks of the back of your knife and the meat should come sliding out fairly easily.
so in order to get to the knuckle meat you 're going to need a decent pair of shears make two incisions opposite of each other on the shell.
remove one side of the shell on the lobster meat.
she comes sliding right out once all your lobster meat is completely cleaned and all the shells are removed from it.
all i have to do now start skewering everything up.
so what 's your lobster, skewered up and ready to go.
i have to do now is make your batter for frying and in this is basically just a corn muffin mix that i bought from the store.
some milk in an egg and all you have to do is completely incorporate.
the mixture, one thing i would recommend before embarking on this recipe is try to find some sort of stick holder that would hold the skewer in place as it fries.
i 'm not too sensitive to oil popping on my hands.
but for those of you have sensitive skin or are n't used to it.
i would, i would definitely look out for something like that.
so , once you done frying lobster corndogs just gently place them on a towel to blot off any excess.
i 'm going to play these with a little bit of whole grain honey mustard.
and there you have it some beautiful lobster corndogs alright.
so these beautiful corn dogs are finished that was pretty intense process.
but definitely worthwhile got a little bit of this spicy honey mustard 'cause.
once a corn dog without mustard.
see that nice little red tinge of the lobster really, really crispy has that sweet flavor from the corn.
nice and buttery, this honey mustard is killer.
have like it 's like a.
