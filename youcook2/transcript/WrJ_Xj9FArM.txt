hey guys and welcome back to the kitchen.
so today i 'm here on my own wife is not here.
but i 'm doing a very exciting recipes today.
a lot of you have been asking for traditional homemade fish and chips.
so we 're going to start off with the chips were using maris piper potatoes today.
because apparently they go squishy in the middle and fluffy and nice and crispy on the outside chips are probably one of my favorite things ever.
but i always feel guilty about using chip shop chips.
because they are fried.
we are going to be baking them.
i always have couples with my fish and chips, and now they 're hard to find chip shops do not stock cockles anymore.
if mike had his way i think we probably have fish and chips take away once a week.
however , it 's usually more like once every couple of months.
but if it works out, well, cooking at home you never know maybe, we can start doing at home self getting paper now.
we 're going to put them in the oven for about forty minutes to bake.
now it 's time for the fish.
but we 're going to do first is make the batter, and we 're using lager.
so also oils heating up.
i 'm just going to sit in two hundred, and twenty.
five grams of self raising flour.
i hate beer but beer battered fish always tastes, we 're going to play the fish were going to do first is called a little bit of flower.
give it over dusting on both sides.
i think this just helps the batter to stick to the fish.
otherwise it gets lonely.
i 'm going to put a little bit of salt pepper on and now, we do n't fish we need to test the oil is hot enough, you must be very, very careful with hot oil.
but you want to take a little bit of bread.
and you want to pop it into the oil and see how it reacts is meant to fizzle away.
tah , dah, i want to have a good coating of batter, and they 're going to pop it in.
and we 're going to try it for two to three minutes on each side and put the other one in as well never fried fish at home.
but it looks amazing.
i 'm really excited by this mike is going to be.
so jealous, is missing this look at that golden brown difficult to know when the fish inside is going to be hooked?
you do n't feel like dry old boot going to take it out now and pop it onto some kitchen roll to soak up any excess oil.
they look amazing.
no fish and chips will we compete without much appease though.
so we 're doing washing.
please as, well, DIY style we 've got pain freeze garden peas boil them away from an earth.
i 'm going to chop up a few leaves of mint and of course, mike is like the condiments bow and heat.
the only thing he likes his mayonnaise for my vinegar and like our souls might catch up with my barbecue sauce just mayonnaise, boring glad he 's not here.
we put them in ten proper crim, fresh in, and we 're going to push them together with a fork.
this is quite fun smoking global rap.
mix it up, put it in our little pot.
i 've never made mushy peas before, but if i do say so myself, i think they look pretty great.
so i want to serve everything up on traditional british newspaper 'cause that is the old fashion way.
here they are, they are looking pretty amazeballs.
i 'm going to pop on a little bit of lemon.
OK , i 'm going to have to catch up on do n't tell mike.
he 's not here what he does n't know.
wo n't hurt him.
moment of truth that is.
so good almost like a real chip shop fish and chips, nothing better than eating chips with your fingers dipped in the mushy peas as well, even though it 's not fried.
i think they 're pretty damn good chips.
i think we absolutely nailed this.
the batter is just crunchy enough it just soggy enough in the right places if you enjoyed our traditional british fish and chips.
