blow , this is chef john for food wishes, dot com with the incredibly easy and always popular vodka sauce and doing it on some penny, which is kind of traditional.
you could do this on spaghetti anything super easy to make and it starts with sartain, usually pancetta, which is an unsmoked italian bacon type product.
but i like to use bacon.
so call me a bad italian, or call me a good american.
but i like to use bacon.
it 's got a little smokey flavor, i think it works really well bacon here.
so in about a tablespoon olive oil, i 'm going to cook that on medium heat, i'ma, throw in a sprig of rosemary and when that gets looking just about like that.
i 'm going to dump in a half a cup of vodka now.
stand back when you do that, because it could flare up.
and it usually does n't.
especially , if using the pen, the shape, i 'm using, using a really shallow panic and flame up.
so be careful with that now, whenever i make this always think where did i get vodka do n't drink vodka, have two bottles of vodka in my freezer have no clue where they came from.
so , thank you, vodka fairies.
so we 're going to put that on high heat, and when it gets down to a couple, tablespoons left see that it 's not evaporated.
but it 's starting to bubble.
it 's getting close were going to dump in our cream that 's heavy cream.
give that a squirrel.
all right, after the cream goes in we 're going to add some black pepper you can add some hot red chili flakes, if you want, want to go with some black pepper and as soon as i cream comes back to a boil or to cook that for about three four minutes.
the cream is going to reduce see that it 's going to thicken up slightly.
it will kind of hold a mark at the bottom of the pan.
we do n't want to over reduce it, but we wanted, reduced a little bit maybe by half.
i 'm gonna dump in three cups of prepared tomato sauce, and about three quarters of a cup of water that i washed out the jar with we 're going to bring that to a simmer , lower.
the heat, and simmer that for about twenty, twenty.
and it 's going to be unbelievably, delicious and it gets to be a really beautiful color in my opinion.
i do n't like a ton of cream.
you notice that only put half a cup.
i do n't like the pink vodka sauce is, i like it a nice kind of brick red color, like you see there.
so that 's going to simmer away in the meantime.
we 're going to boil our penny pasta in salted water.
i 'm using the umbrella brand.
i like the multigrain, and then, you know, the trick drain the pasta.
cook it one minute under what you normally would dump the hot sauce over its turn around.
and then we 're going to throw the lid on and let it sit for about five minutes, and just relax.
it 's going to soak up the sauce.
it 's going to finish cooking, and then we serve it with a little extra cheese on top vodka sauce, really, really delicious.
you may have heard alton brown or one of those other food scientist guys say it.
but there 's certain flavors in tomato that are only brought out if you introduce alcohol into the sauce, so this is one of those.
that 's why it has a really interesting taste, you can use pancetta.
you can use bacon and you can make a vegetarian if you want.
so , that 's it.
pene pasta with vodka sauce.
i hope you give that a try all the ingredients are on the site and as always enjoy.
