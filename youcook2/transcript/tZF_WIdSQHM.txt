so you liked my sons show.
some of you want him to replace me, i read those comments that was crazy, you guys are insane that 's it.
he does n't get on the show anymore until halloween at least, anyway, i love him.
dearly he did a great job.
boy was that fettuccine alfredo amazing.
in fact, drummer two, two four already submitted, a picture look at this look, how beautiful that looks great job i just want to thank jack junior for a wonderful job today yeah, we all know, that i 'm doing kimchi.
i 'm either thinking of doing falafel which is kind of a middle eastern food or i 'm going to do FA, which is a vietnamese dish.
i do n't know when that 's going to be my next international shell.
so i 'm leaving it up to you guys down.
below is it falafel or is it far.
which one am i making you put it down below.
and we 'll see who wins and that will be my next international show.
i promise you first thing.
we 're going to do is prepare the cabbage second thing we 're going to do is make those dice 'em all up.
third thing we 're going to do is make the paste.
i 'm doing an easy version.
some of you may be familiar with leaving the cabbage at whole and opening the leaves mine is more of a lazy man 's version.
we 're going to cut up the lettuce into bite size pieces.
first thing we 're going to do is rinse all the cabbage.
so you 're going to need a big, big container.
big bowl big pot.
anything the rinse the cabin were going to rinse it off with water and then drain it all to fill the whole thing with water.
next thing you want to do is get your salt.
i keep my kosher salt in this container, and we 're going to solve the entire top of it like your seasoning the top.
this is the process where i guess it 's like curing your, your cabbage or something.
i do n't know.
but basically, we 're going to salt it.
we 're going to leave it then in thirty minutes.
we 're going to flip it and salted again and then flip it insulted again.
then we 're going to rinse all the salt out of it.
so it 's an hour and a half process of the cabbage.
so i 'm going to leave this here and then come back to it in thirty minutes in the meantime, we 're going to go over back over the table and we 're going to start preparing everything else, all right.
now it 's time to prepare all the vegetables, i like to get those out of the way.
so that i can just throw them in when it 's time as you notice i 'm cutting these kind of had an angle getting kind of weird shape i 'm not cutting them exactly normal.
so i 'm giving him like a OK here 's the korean radish i was kind of cut this in pieces here i 'm going to cut this going to cut this right down the middle.
i 'm going to cut this really thin pieces like this, OK, and then your onions and your chives are just going to be in pieces like, like that one two inch pieces.
and then you 're going to cut the same with the chives.
and we 're just going to wear throwing them right now.
we 're throwing them all in a bowl, you may want to leave their band, the bottom.
so you can just sit here and make a lot easier to hold it together.
first thing we 're going to do to make our pace is created porridge as they call it, you 're going to get three cups of water and you 're going to take this sweet rice flour.
and you 're going to boil these two together once those are starting to boil.
you 're going to throw this in this is the sugar.
and it 's going to become a little translucent alright, here we go.
put the flower in the water.
going to mix it up.
real , well, and bring it to a little bit of a boil.
all right, as you can see on the edge season.
the perimeter bubbles are being made, yep.
but we 're going to put the sugar in.
now there you go.
mic , setting good.
you 're going to just keep this in there and stir in for a few.
turn it off and let it cool.
so we 've cooked it in for a few minutes.
we 're going to put this on the back burner or let the school for a little bit we 're going to start working on the rest of our paste.
i 'm going to blend these ingredients.
these three ingredients, i 'm going to put in the food processor in his hit, it let 's could be ginger garlic and onion.
let 's hope i have enough room if not.
i 'll make room.
it 's really easy, just put it on hit it, and then put the rest stuff in so.
if you do n't have enough room, just do what you got.
and then we 'll move on.
OK in there, there we go just go ahead and put in what you got, you 'll have room in a minute.
this thing is awesome.
i really love, love my ninja.
it 's a powerful, you do n't have to worry about the motor burning out.
it 's great, if you have n't seen the ninja video later just click on the link at the end of the video.
i 'll send you over there.
you can see my review of it.
OK cabbage has been rinsed off.
thoroughly it 's kind of what our pay stuff together, so here we go, here 's our porridge mixture.
we 're going to put that in first we 're going to have the fish sauce.
all right now look at this pepper flakes.
i got the pet reflects the agent store just in case.
these are a different type of temperature, they ask for a lot of pepper flakes is where you control the heat.
if you like it spicy, follow the recipe.
if you do n't like it too spicy, then back off on the pepper flakes a little bit and then we 've got our onions.
garlic and ginger mixture.
going to put that in there mix this all around.
give this all work done, oh, wow.
OK , these, these smells are all coming together.
it looks crazy, unbelievable.
i can explain the garlic and the pepper in the fish sauce.
is just battling it out right.
now , right now we 're going to, we 're going to mix in all this stuff into this beautiful all coming together.
i love this part when you start doing everything i love this part.
when you start throwing everything together, now the last part is this getting this into here you get your hands dirty so be ready he got.
kids bring him in there going to love this most kimchi is fermented and what that means is almost like we 're going to leave this out and it 's going to start.
bubbling , and it 's going to get really sour you 're not going to refrigerate this, you can eat it like this.
you do n't like the sour taste.
this will be amazing.
the last thing i want to do is you want to place this in an airtight container.
that 's what 's going to ferment in there.
it is i 'm going to leave this on the counter for forty eight hours.
instead , an airtight container leave it on the counter for a minimum.
hours , you 're going to see when you crack it.
is going to smell sour, and it 's going to bubbles created on the surface you 'll see it if you do n't want to sour your kimchi?
i choose to just put it right in the fridge.
but i leave mine on the counter for two days.
so here 's what i 'm going to do, i mean, i 'm going to try it for us to let you know how it is 'cause it just smells amazing.
