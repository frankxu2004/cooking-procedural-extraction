hi , i would record brand and they 're going to make vegetable spring rolls young.
let me tell you what goes into this dish.
we 're going to start with carrots.
celery , cilantro green onions, frozen green peas, she talking mushrooms.
cabbage bean sprouts.
and we 're going to wrap them up and spring roll wrappers.
we 're going to use canola oil for frying today, but peanut oil or vegetable oil works just great, too.
so we need to get her pot hot because we 're going to cook some of those vegetables, so i take my carrot.
and i 'm going to shred it, ah.
pretty i think that 's enough.
i 'm going to put about one tablespoon of my oil switch that around and talks are carrots in there to start cooking turn on the stove.
i 'm going to turn that on high and start heating your oil.
i 've already courted in there and it 's about three inches in that pot.
the next dentist vegetable, we 're going to be cooking is our celery.
i use the very end of the summary to nothing goes to waste in my kitchen, OK with aquatic goes give a stir right next no.
how these really beautiful shit talking mushrooms.
they give it such a great labor.
these are fresh.
that used to be like ten to fifteen dollars a pound.
but i have been watching and the years have gone by an i give these now for about three fifty four fifty account, which is solids.
nothing gives the chinese flavor in a dish like a shit talking mushroom.
all right into the papagos, it 's looking a little dry to me and i got a little more oil of that, that 's a total of two tablespoons of the oil that 's on medium.
now an i 'm certain this.
it is time to add a little salt to that this is probably one half teaspoon of salt next i 'm going to add a green onions.
also called spring onions.
i 'm going to cut them that same old kind of cut kind of vertical and then go.
so i cut the white parts and that 's going to go my saute pan.
but the tops are going to be more for garnish 'cause it 's pretty there the lightest of the flavor of the onion.
so stick those white parts in an halfway up that stock and the rest will be for garnish, swish, swish now.
let 's shred that cabbage.
so to do that might just cut very thin pieces, the goal is to have almost the same quantity of everything.
but i had a little extra cabbage.
it 's easy to cook easy to cut, and i love the flavor in it stared at around and you 're going to let that cook for two minutes.
we 're going to put some salon together so chop it up.
just chalk believes do n't to the stem systems can be a little woody.
so add your cilantro, add your bean sprouts.
that 's about one cup of bean sprouts through that, yeah, that looks really good.
like that, which is getting a little soft.
hey , it 's been one minute.
this , these browsers software now good.
let 's take it off the heat.
gen hey, so with her half cup of frozen peas i had rinse them and they started to defrost, and they 're just about cooked anyways.
i do not like these overcooked, so this is fine.
just to go into our hot mixture, and i also like it because this is going to bring down the temperature of my hot mixture.
so i do n't kill my fingertips while trying to wrap this just toss him around.
so i come up, oh, my gosh.
right now let 's open are won ton wrappers so you find your equal rappers.
your spring roll wrappers in the refrigerated section of your grocery store make it look like a diamond that you 're looking at and put in two tablespoons of your mixture.
so you put it on the part.
closest to you, and you take your little corner and you stick it like that, you know, what a little extra 'cause you want it firmly in there, and then you start pudding in your other corners like that, an roll it in, and when you get to the end at little water.
because you want to seal it then.
let 's do another alright two tablespoons in your diamond starter, olin tucking your sides, keep on rolling little water.
walla fast as easy as it gets.
so i 'm going to finish up.
and they 're going to fry these things.
how about a spring roll today i will try am.
so now we 're going to test the oil and make sure it 's hot enough, so i just drop in whatever ingredient handy.
i 've got some carrots in my hand from that dish, yeah, it 's definitely hot enough.
so we 're going to put in three at a time because i want to keep that temperature of our oil hot.
if you put in more than three, you have a larger batch and does n't get his crispy.
you 're going to cook them probably one minute per side.
if you oils really hot like mine is what you 're looking for, is a toasty brown color, so when you see it get toasted ground now.
there you go look at that guy.
see that, so then he gets flipped over flip.
there 's the other one there.
we go a beautiful.
so put them in carefully by pudding in one end and dropping them slowly, you do n't want it to splatter on you.
now just gently toss them around in a circle.
so that all sides get cooked evenly.
it could take one to two minutes for this step.
it goes really fast.
but you better be here to baby sit him.
they 'll get a wild milton brown really fast beautiful.
i had made a little sauce, which is my favorite of white vinegar and chopped.
and i use a little soy sauce so into the dip.
we do a perfectly manicured bite.
let 's try it, oh, my god, it is better than any restaurant spring roll and i 'm not kidding you it 's a talking.
mushrooms got so much flavor in it.
so , chunking cheers.
