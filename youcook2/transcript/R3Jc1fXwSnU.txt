it 's begin and today 's video is about probiotics and sauerkraut.
i just wanna give you a little bit of background before i go into the recipe that i 'm going to share with you.
a couple years ago, i was having issues with my digestive track, and i think actually, what caused it is.
i was working somewhere where i was getting really sick all the time, and.
so i had gone through a few courses of antibiotics and my stomach was just giving me.
so many problems.
and i knew a way to fix it naturally was through probiotics, but i did n't want to use something that was full of animal product.
so i did n't want to use like a key for or one of those expensive things that they sell in whole foods like in glass bottles.
it 's pro biotic which is great.
but the majority of it comes from milk, also, believe that cam bucha has great probiotic properties.
but i was out of town at the time and did n't have access to a kitchen.
so i was not wanting to spend four dollars every single day to buy a kombucha.
so this is something that i kind of to have gotten tool, i can really enjoy when i was in poland.
i ate like sauerkraut daily, if you look at my instagram.
i think i was in love with sauerkraut.
i put so many pictures up, but this is a recipe that we stumbled upon my husband.
and i he 's polish, so he introduced me to sauerkraut.
then i realized after some time that there is actually pro biotic properties in sauerkraut, which is unbelievable.
so i 'm going to show you how to make it.
but first let me just tell you a couple things that are beneficial to know about this vegan source of probiotic, fermented vegetables are very rich acid in along with other natural assets that are produced in your digestive system those help break apart the suns disgusting.
but like putrefied food, undigested food that becomes putrefied in your digestive track.
so it really helps break that apart and flush it out cabbage and broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables are really good for your system.
anyway , they have alot of fiber, they are actually anti cancerous.
and then when you combine the with the pro biotic process that happens in fermentation you have these two things that just like band powered together an it really gives, your digestive system a cleaning out as well as a flushing through to say it for lack of a better term sauerkraut is something that i have been searching for here in the US, trying to find something that compares to what i ate in poland, an anything giard like just pales in comparison.
so we wanted to make our own sauerkraut we wanted to find a recipe that was completely pure and.
so this is the recipe without further ado it has very little ingredients it 's just a head of cabbage, which if you can get, organic cabbage where you live three dollars something like that, if you ca n't find organic cabbage, then it 's going to be even less than that, an i use himalayan salt with it and all you need is some kind of empty glass jar that 's cleaned very, very well an that has some kind of lid on it, an honestly that is, all you need the cabbage provides its own water overtime and the process takes about five, six days and it is.
so delicious that actually takes exactly like the cabbage that i 've tried in europe, and it 's fresh, and it 's roann it 's wonderful.
so here we go this is what you need to do to make this sauerkraut in your home two point, two pounds, or one kilo of green cabbage thinly chopped i use a food processor you can use that if you have it, it 's not you can chop it by hand number two one point five tablespoons or twenty five grams of good quality salt, no table salt, table salt is.
so bad for you, i could make a whole another video on that i used himalayan sea i use himalayan salt you can also use like celtic sea salt any of those are good, good quality cells number three is optional i did n't edit this time.
but right so you can add two grated carrots number four get a need two big pickle jars, or any kind of glass jar that has a lid the jars that i used R thirty ounce jars each, or what i think would be better.
although i have yet to find a gigantic jar i think one jar at sixty ounces would be perfect for one whole head of cabbage here 's what you need to do chop the cabbage in your food processor or by hand and then put it in a big bowl with the salt and leave it uncovered for an hour you want to just mix it together with your hands or with a spoon whatever.
so gets everywhere after some time some water is just going to come out from the cabbage and.
so you leave it there for a full hour and, then you mix it again after the hour and you transfer it equally, between both jars in the jars once it 's in the jars we want to have the top quarter of the jar empty.
so you 're only going to fill to cabbage in a jar like three quarters of the way.
the reason for this is because it 's going to rise liquid 's going to come.
and it needs that space for fermentation.
you 're going to match it down with something you can use any kind of spoon you have.
i happen to use a vitamix.
what the heck is that called.
i think it 's called a tamper.
and this is what i used.
and then you place it somewhere at room temperature with the lid on, but not screwed on tight.
you want it to be covered so that junk does n't get into it just from sitting around all five six days.
but you do n't want to close the lid.
because it will stop the fermentation process, and you do n't want to put it in the fridge with the lid, closed.
because that also will stop the fermentation process, mister or not disturb that is, the question.
some people believe stirring the sauerkraut daily, is a good thing in mashing it down some people?
believe you should just let it sit and do its thing.
i kind of in between on those.
so if it looks like it needs a little stir i 'll start it in place, the lid carefully back on other times i 'll let it go a couple days without staring at all.
then , you wait for five or six days until it looks good and tasty and then you taste it and you see, if it 's good, you are liking.
then you can screw the lid on and put it in the fridge and if it 's not to your liking, you can let it sit another day, and it 's really as simple as that.
and that 's it.
this is the finished product, it has completely filled up.
it looks beautiful.
the green color that 's only answer the join there, have turned to a lovely wait, an kind of different shade of green, and it 's really good sunday.
and i wanted to say that it did n't say earlier is some people use vinegar and sauerkraut.
and it 's just not necessary.
it 's i do n't think it 's a good thing for you to be ingesting all the time.
i 've heard controversial things about vinegar.
so , i try to stay away from it, except for cleaning my dishes, but, i do n't use any vinegar.
it 's just not necessary and it takes amazing and can i see your little taste.
this actually stayed for five days my mouth is watering hole very good.
OK , try this recipe and tell me what you think tell me if you log in as much as i do.
like subscribe cigarettes next time.
