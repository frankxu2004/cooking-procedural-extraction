hi , this is sylvia and welcome back to a new piece out of cooking with the afghan gamestyle today with my kitchen.
because we 're going to cook, and we 're going to cook one of my favorite korean dishes called creeping stuff between means mixed batmans.
rice so basically it 's a mixed rice dish.
where you have a bowl of rice with different types of vegetables around and some kind of protein like beef or chicken or egg for vegetarian option and today.
we 're going to make it my way because we 're going to make a rip.
it back so, it 's that start.
first , we 're going to prepare all over ingredients, little by little, so there are some kind of preparation, but do n't worry.
easy , here i have a carrot.
so just pull your carrot.
so far so culture, the carrot and then cut it in a julian style.
so just still, looks like this, if the carrot is big slice, it again.
so you have thinner sticks like that now, i 'm going to do the same thing for the zucchini.
so have a subpoena here, cut the bottom, the tip, and then cut it in half quarter, it, and thinly slice, you can keep them like this, or just put them together and cut them in half again we 're also going to use mushrooms.
i 'm using some sort of trumpet mushrooms you can use shataiki mushrooms or regular white mushrooms and again.
we 're going to thinly sliced them.
we 're not done with the vegetables.
yet i have a fresh spinach and i have bean sprouts.
so as you can see this is really healthy.
pick the vegetables.
you like, and now i 'm going to show you how to cook them.
it 's super easy.
further spinach boil, some water in a sauce pan.
and , then just put the spinach in for like around one minute after one minute.
remove this finish from the boiling water and put it in cold water that also has.
i see, i have an ice cube here.
that will make the spinach state green and khrisann.
we want that.
so keep it here for two minutes, and then we 're going to remove it, while this finishes cooling down as a pinch of salt large pinch of salt in the boiling water and add the bean sprouts to it.
so we 're going to boil them for around fifteen minutes back to the spinach just take it from the cold water and give it a good squeeze.
and that 's it, it 's ready.
i 'm going to so take the zucchini carrot anna mushroom using the moroccan, chermoula spices.
and that 's the more rockin twist.
here i have some cumin.
paprika hot, chili pepper spicy, and some salt and a little bit of crushed garlic.
and we 're going to do this with olive oil super easy.
so first mix, all the spices here so you just have to add a pinch of this mixture in a flat pan.
drizzle a little bit of olive oil and a little bit of crushed garlic and a little bit of our spice mixture.
this is to heat up the spices.
so all the flavors comes up.
and now we 're going to take the vegetables separately, so, first i 'm going to start with the zucchini, and i 'm just going to still take for like forty five seconds remove this bikini.
but in a play and we 're going to do the same thing for the carrots.
so a little bit of olive oil garlic a little bit of spices, mix.
and add the carrots.
and we 're going to disobey them for like a minute.
remove the carrot here all crispy and again we 're going to do the same thing for the mushroom.
so say them again for like one minute, it should be fun for my protein.
am using shrimp.
so i just cleaned a little bit depend.
i put olive oil and my peeled thresh ring.
here i 'm going to use a little bit of lemon juice like a fresh squeezed, and i 'll just make them.
i 'm not going to add the sharp ola spices on the shrimp because i think the other vegetables are already flavorful.
so just a little bit of salt and a little bit of better.
there 's my pepper and that 's it.
then the dish will get the sharma like prices from the vegetables.
shrimp cook pretty fast, so, as soon as it turns like a pack and pink, it 's ready.
so remove it from the juices and just keep the shrimp.
one more thing for the spinach just give it a little shop.
you do n't want these there, too hard to eat.
but chop the rest as you can see it 's a very easy recipe and here i have all my ingredients, and they 're all super healthy and.
now i 'm going to show you how to put the people back together first we 're going to put cooked rice here.
so for cooked rice, i mean, you can use any kind of rest you want white rice.
you can use rice cooker or it 's one cup of rice, two cups of water a little bit of salt, a little bit of olive oil you close it and you cook it for twenty minutes.
i 'll be fine.
now i 'm going to display the vegetables nicely around the ranks, so for submit some carrots here, that is a keeney sam bean sprouts.
and of course, remove them from the water.
once they finished.
boiling , i have the mushrooms.
also young, you can see all these beautiful colors and different textures.
i love this dish.
we have this spinach here a little bit of queen, and finally the party.
and you put the protein in the center and to finish the moroccan touch.
i 'm going to sprinkle it with a little bit of fresh chopped cilantro young and give a little bit of color and central just works with charmoula.
so this is perfect.
and that 's it here is my pick it back with a more rocket twist you can serve it hotter cold.
so you can prepare the vegetables before hand, and just serve a mighty, and or right after you cook them like i showed you also be careful with the salt there.
a couple of things that it did n't solve like the spinach and the big sprouts is because i added a little extra salt in the shrimp.
so , i know, when you mix it up all the phrase versus will be mixed together so the spices.
you have to be careful about that when you 're using different types of vision of them different terms of cooking that 's it.
look how pretty it is an now.
we 're going to make this and distance, just makes all the stuff here together with the rice yummy.
so the thing is in korea, they serve it with green hot sauce, which is like a red hot sauce.
red pepper hot sauce is too spicy for me.
sometimes i like it like this.
however , you can replace the korean hot sauce with harris.
yes , it would be perfect now.
that 's real fusion, so you mix, mix, mix using chopsticks here and you just test young tickle.
a spinach with a little here.
wow i get to korea and morocco, both question out in my mouth.
