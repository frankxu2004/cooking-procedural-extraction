hey everybody how you doing is junkyard here and welcome to another episode of cooking with junkyard.
well , today we are going back to our asian routes.
why do n't have any asian roots?
but i forgot just throw that in you have probably seen, or if you have not you gotta, check out the junker cooking playlist, or i made some sushi rolls.
california rolls now again, i am not a chef in any way when it comes to any of this stuff.
i 'm just, god loves to cook, and loves to share with you guys.
i have been able to figure out.
there 's how to make some wonderful MLG spicy tuna roll.
so , i think i was going to go ahead and show you how to make those well.
let 's get started alright.
the ingredients are pretty basic.
we have ourselves a nice piece of sushi tuna, we have some eggs.
we also have some japanese mail, and some japanese or asian style hot sauce it 's called serrara, suraci hot sauce chili sauce.
some sesame E seeds, we have ourselves.
some seaweed, go ahead and rap it up in as well as we have ourselves.
some sushi rice first thing we want to go ahead and do it, cut the tune up so pretty much.
we 're just going to go ahead and slices up what a slice of pretty much on the grains.
so it stays somewhat together.
but sushi rolls were pretty much, just chopping it up.
so it 's alright, alright you this was actually pre frozen flash, frozen in the ocean is how they do it.
nowadays so as you can see we just got in nice.
we do n't want him too big.
but we do n't want him too small either.
so we 're just going to go ahead and slice this up.
all right going to put it all in a bowl, then on top of that.
we 're going to go ahead and add the fish roe fish eggs.
good scooper, that all right they were going to add some of the hot sauce to make that spicy and remember, this has a good bite to it.
so be ginger.
if you do n't want to give it a lot.
we 're going to add.
then , we 're just going to pretty much stir it all up again.
the more hot sauce, you add the spicier.
it gets like that beautiful alright, next the first couple things we need to do is get ourselves.
we have our clean cutting board here.
we have our bamboo rap again.
this is something you could pick up at lots of grocery stores now.
but you could also pick this up at some asian specialty restaurant or an asian specialty market in such as app.
now when you have your sushi rap, you actually have two different size.
you got a shiny side, and a little bit duller side.
the dollar sign is where you 're going to go ahead.
sticky rice or your aka sushi rice.
now i also have some water right here.
this is where you want to always go ahead and put your want to keep your hands.
moist alright, and we 're going to do is i like to go ahead and rinse a little bit of the water off.
and you want to go ahead and then grab the sushi.
a nice big do n't be shy.
go ahead and grab a nice hunker sushi.
now you need to go ahead and make sure your hands stay moist, otherwise.
will stick to the rice making it.
well , the easiest thing to work with here.
all right so what we 're going to do is go.
ahead , and lay the rice out pretty much all over the whole piece of seaweed and one thing you could always add things to this if you want, i mean, i 'm just going to go ahead and just put the tuna roll in there.
but you could add, if you want you could add avocados to it , cucumbers.
all kinds of stuff.
but this professional version is going to go ahead and just add the tuner.
so we got the rice right there, then we 're adding the tuner on it.
next just make a nice line right down the side there add some of the sesame E C.
and then what we could do then, what you do is you want to get a right to the edge of the bambuti, and then folded over just like that see the way that folds over and, then you got this you want to try to make sure you do n't put the bamboo part of it right into the other part.
so then we pretty much just pull it.
and then you just roll it just like so and that 's about it.
now you 're going to get it 's not going to always stick right here.
so if you need to add a little bit of moisture to it.
take advantage of that water and is roll it up a couple more times and there you go simple as that sushi rolls.
now so go ahead the.
next step is you want to go ahead and cut it up.
you want to get a real sharp knife now unfortunately my knives, well, i would love to say, i have a real sharp knife.
but i do n't.
my names are getting pretty dull.
but , i mean, it 's doing it.
OK , what you want to do though, is always before you cut it, do you want to put the knife inside the water like.
so , and then tap it so the water goes all the way down.
before you cut into the sushi.
i pretty much and then you cut your sushi up like.
so then you just go ahead and lay it out real nicely on a sushi dish or potted ish or little dish, whatever you have all right did dad there.
you could add a little bit of garnish right here and you got a little bit of wassabi right there.
a little bit of pickled ginger, there you go fresh.
spicy tuna roll.
it 's going to give this a shot.
fresh spicy tuna roll simple asian cuisine really tasty, really flavorful, very class, effective, you realize you go out, too.
the sushi restaurant, an order.
this , it 'll cost ten bucks, just for one.
i got enough here to make quite a field, and it cost maine about ten bucks as far as ingredients go.
and i 'm going to have plenty for myself.
and , my kids to go ahead and have a lot of fun much on, so go ahead and do n't be shy.
make sure you 're going to make some mistakes, but go ahead and try it out anyway.
this is junkyard hope.
you go ahead and give this a try.
thanks for watching needless to say, keep cooking.
