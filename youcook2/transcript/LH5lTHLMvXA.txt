what 's that do, that, do, that do to re nissan pilot today.
i 'm going to show you how to make some hummus, so how much will drop popular a few years ago.
and then, everybody got off on to this other food trends like sushi and turduckens and anything that you could buy out of a trailer.
but whatever how much is still good and if you were dating a vegan, it 's one thing that y'all can eat together.
so , let 's make some OK.
so here i have one two three four five ingredients plus water.
i do n't count water.
i put my chick peas in there.
i rinse them and rainham an sometimes i use the food processor.
but since most people do n't have one and my food processor looks all grimy and it does not look sexy on camera i decided to use mobile under probably for one can of chickpeas put in like the juice of one lemon.
it 's a good start.
so i 'll do that in just a second limit, squeeze lemons.
sorry , OK, yeah, OK.
and then couple cloves of garlic not really need to cut them up 'cause i 'm going to put in a blender.
this is going to do that, ah, sorry mild jazz today, feeling sexual call thomas OK, anyways tahini, teeny is a sesame E paste.
this is, yum, nature brand probably is going to be good 'cause it has the word yum in the brand name going to shake it 'cause it 's like natural peanut butter, and it separates so.
yeah , anyways, probably two tablespoons to start with.
it 's kind of bitter.
if you put too much in so.
but then the lemon juice kind of counteracts that bitterness and that 's good in just a couple tablespoons, olive oil i 'll use a lot more water, then olive oil, and generally 'cause i like to, you know, keep fat content lowered.
so i can watch my figure better and look good to make my cooking show on the TV.
OK , i 'm going to blend it up in the blender.
OK , i 'm going to jab at it, stir it around, and then do that, some more totally perfect, oh, my god kitchen genius alert, alert him.
kitchen dork, sorry alright.
so i look at role of real smooth.
so i let it blend for like a minute, or so, i do n't need to add any salt because the chick peas have salt in them.
ann juice of one lemon approximately two tablespoons, two tablespoons to teenie, tablespoon of olive oil about a half a cup of water.
well , quarter cup of water perfect homas, look at that and look.
hey , i want to.
i can get some hungarian paprika put that on top.
make it look like it 's at your favorite mediterranean restaurant alright that 's it.
