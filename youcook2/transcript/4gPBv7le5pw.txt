hello , i 'm george from jamies food team and i 'm going to show you how to pair the base for your soup.
so we 've got here the key ingredients will celery carrots, onions and garlic.
and this is the perfect base for any super.
not just the super making today and all of these will add great flavor sweetness.
and they can be used for almost any soup.
so what you want to do is if you just remember, too.
so you have two sticks of celery to onion.
two carrots, too close of garlic and that will sort you out.
so start with the celery, depending on whether not you 're blitz signal soup or you 're keeping as a broth will determine how chunky or fine you want to chop your veg.
always have an empty bowl to hand, as well, for scraps, just makes it easier then keep going stuff spin.
so if the seller you do n't need to peel, it just trim off the ends.
and if you want it for brothy soup it 's quite nice to keep it quite chunky.
if you 're going to blitz up, it does n't really matter to be honest as long as you get lots of lovely color in new software that you 're going to bliss up anyway.
so slice of your salary push that 's one side, and.
now the carrots pens on how you know, smaller pressure carrots are you can peel the modules, scrub them send appeal these move.
the onion not sitting half always find it 's easier to take this outside off.
if you cut it in half first keep the root intact 'cause that 's where that will help keep the onion layers together.
so when you 're cutting it wo n't fall.
if you chop that off, then you 'll be in trouble.
because then all the layers will fall apart and make it much harder to shop.
so keep that hole.
and you can just discard at the end and again cutting onions as fine or trunk as you like.
depending on the type of soup and feed garlic just need a couple of clothes.
i just cut off the end just a little bit easier to crush, get the skins off.
so put the flats of your knife inside the garlic and using the palmer hand just push down.
let 's push too hard.
and this is the easiest way to get the skin off.
and again you can slice or chop your garlic.
i like to slice it just.
because i do n't like it to burn a catch too, easily and if you chop it to you fine, it can catch and even really bitter taste.
so just slice it quite fine.
they have it there the base ingredients and all you have to do now is let them get lovely bit of color.
so put it on medium.
low heat going to add the garlic first, just for a minute just wanna get a little bit of color ones.
there we go and lightly golden.
now that 's perfect at the rest of your base if it 's the and then literally this, or say the badge for about ten minutes, since it 's lovely and soft.
and this will give you fantastic flavor.
the base of any suit, so there we have it.
that 's the basis of our soup and is it before that would be the base for almost any soup.
those are the key ingredients and their lovely and sticky and sweet.
and i think put down.
and now we got them to that stage.
we can get on with the rest of our soup, OK now we 've made our base on a tournament of really delicious tomato and basil soup.
so all we need to do is will turn this back on back onto a medium heat, and we 're going to put in a tin of really good tin tomatoes inside and break it up a bit just put in ten of plum tomatoes and broke them off.
a bit will do now, is add three fresh tomatoes?
a nice tip here is actually you, could you wanted at this talks as well?
there 's loads of flavor.
if you smell that, that 's actually where that amazing vine tomatoes milk comes from is not the monster themselves.
it 's the storks and they 'll breakdown and actually, you know, what put them in as well, some chicken stock of your vegetarian, you can use veggie stock.
it 's not a problem.
we 've got elites are really lovely organic chicken stock there, and then gently just bring over things.
the boil season, it well get some push.
the ground, black pepper good sea salt.
we get spoiled and then simmer it for fifteen twenty minutes, going to put in some fresh basil.
so we should grab from the bigger leaves we can use the little ones for garnishing later.
stir that through we need to.
we go that 's still got bill texted to it, which is lovely.
if you want it super smooth, and just karen blitzing it.
that 's fine, and you can finish this suit.
both however you like really it 's really lovely with like little basil oil.
we have to do is crush up some basil leaves in a pestle and mortar.
bash them up with a pinch of salt.
really good oil and drizzle on top.
or , you could even finish off with a really good homemade pesto.
some shavings of parmesan or a little chopped red chili for little kick that would be great.
so we have it and just because i absolutely love loads of black pepper to put extra pinch super.
that couple of beautiful little basil, leaves in a drizzle and they have a really fantastic, and dad easy tomato and basil soup.
