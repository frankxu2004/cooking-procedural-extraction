when i think of french cuisine, i think of the beef bourguignon.
so i 'm very excited that shit dumb, yeah, it could be taking us through one today is slow, cook.
the wait is now so we start with a special piece of beef.
you put salt on you have to check your job.
you have to choose some special piece of beef for stew, or you.
so , like a check statement, so now you put on the cut very important, a bit of oil, the oil is very, very odd.
stuck to smoke.
yeah , i can see that.
and now the fuck we can start staring once it 's around a little bit so now.
your meat is very brown, OK, and i hope we put carrots crap like this audience, this.
so quite rough cuts of the vegetables because it can be a slow cooked meal.
but two or three oils in our is very long, long cooking so try this.
so , no flight moose tube run the onion and carrots on a very high heat.
yes , five minutes OK, very correct.
we put follow is to make the source.
borghini , oh, OK, OK.
and look is very visual to be white, and we would pick up tomato constant credit to match.
so that 's not up here a yes for the color on the face on the acidity of the recipe.
here we put time on laurier OK.
scott laid this like a booking only OK if you have a person.
blah , the coup, you put this so those were stalks of coseley.
and now five minutes more to cook the flow out like your home.
you see that there 's a little paste that 's formed at the bottom with all the herds flower and some are so puree.
and that 's really going to help when, we add the wine to make the source.
the bug in your this is very important.
now you put red wine strong with red wine.
i could burgundy wine.
we put garlic and the paper.
the wallpaper on exam much lately peppercorns in whole we do n't grind them, and the same with the garlic.
so afterwards, we 're going to put the whole source through a sieve and get rid of the time storks and the garlic cloves anything like that, so.
no , to you boil.
maybe five minutes, the wine, because it is not to be too strong OK, you have to boil, boil boy with that.
this , one temperature boiling without limit five minutes, five minutes.
and you cook very, very, very slowly two or three oils, that 's the time quotations baseball going on, is just bubbling away in the corner there?
so we 're going to start with the garniture, or is it just a two people in a little bit of oil, i put that long.
so we get the bacon on a high heat.
i have much drama.
i could meet for just cut them into four nice big mushrooms staying with the rustic style of the whole dish vogue noise.
you 'd run through.
is a brother, right?
so you have to have the nature similar from very important.
so need the colors that come out in the garden shed its well cook very long, long, long help.
just the piece of beef to tell me, french is discounted.
so we 're just fishing out the pieces of beef, leaving all the vegetables and have no lupus.
the source book father in password and that will stop all the herbs, garlic and other things.
we do n't want to eat, be undergone, it you 're on the top of the volume like this, and the volume is finished.
i did n't know it took this long to cook.
but we really treating ourselves, so, whatever T.
