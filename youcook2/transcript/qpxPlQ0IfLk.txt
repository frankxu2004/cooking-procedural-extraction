let 's go on this.
so real quick, let 's get to the chicken.
i have a boneless and skinless chicken breasts were going to drizzle a touch of olive oil just over the top not much.
and we 're going to hit it with little bit of salt and pepper that 's good looking.
are going to go down skin side down onto our grouping beautiful for our croutons have a nice french baguette basically just going to take certain hyphen?
do thin long cuts, like this, probably about an inch thicker, so here 's what touch available over the top?
and i also have a little bit of dehydrated timer, dried thyme is really, uh, really aromatic spice.
and once it hits the grill in the oils should explode with the roma going to make her really lovely crew times, and then we 're going to take these little bad boys.
we write down on the grill alot of people talk about, you know, one part 'cause this is like one grill, cooking everything is going to take place right under look at that i 'm talking about all you need is nice high heat.
so chickens facing this way we 're going to turn it in ninety degrees to face the other direction to get that beautiful crossmark.
so remember if it 's facing this way.
give it a few minutes, and then flip it this way.
it 's pretty easy almost every restaurant.
you go to has a caesar salad.
because they 're delicious so, i 'm going to show you how to make kind of my spin on the classic caesar dressing going to start with some mayonnaise going to take a little bit of mayo, take a little bit of dijon mustard.
hey , now touch of white wine vinegar we 're going to add saddle little touch of olive oil.
let 's add some parmesan cheese.
now this is one of those key ingredients.
you gotta, have parmesan cheese in your caesar, dressing.
so this part, this is kind of like the crux of caesar salad, dressing you can make some fakes.
but if you do n't have anchovies or anchovy paste you 're not really achieving the original asos pretty potent.
you wo n't need too much going to add the juice of half of a lemon.
one of the other key ingredients of the original recipe is raw egg which not a huge fan out, i mean, you can do it if you want to and just getting to be old school.
we 're going to add some avocado for that rich creamy texture that we were n't going to cut it in half longways just like that going to put have a kind of right into our blender and that 's quick and easy, and it 's going to be delicious just put a lid on and give his app.
i like it all right.
and , that is all finished.
so i have a head of romaine lettuce, just going to cut it right down the center is really, really beautiful.
you can see all the different layers of the lettuce, leaves during take it of olive oil orange is all right over the top.
and i use your fingers to rub the flat cut side 'cause that was going to help us get that beautiful char from the grill that looks excellent and go right down on the hot part of the grill, the same thing with their second one, you know, i 'm like, every other guy love burgers chicken wings.
they have a light side, too.
so chicken salad is fun.
we just grew the lettuce, and then it 's cool check.
