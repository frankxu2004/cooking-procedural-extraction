hey , what 's cooking.
this is jeff louise.
if i can cook, you can cook your watching wawa TV welcome to all my work i am.
chef louise, if i could cook, you can cook they were making a very famous dish.
it 's called map for tofu, an in english is that any different is just marple tofu.
so the ingredients will need today first to poop and that in chinese is tofu, then, we 're going to need ground pork.
sweet dream, rome scallion tone and a very conveniently prepared mark cordova sauce, and this is jose jiang.
and you get these any supermarket a chinese supermarket, mostly.
and there are different kinds you can try them for a different flavor.
oh , see which one.
you like the best this makes everything.
so much easier to prepare.
so all you need to do is first prepared the gulf tofu gonna cut the tofu into cubes and i 'm going to do that just right in the dish with a knife call into small pieces and make sure we get the tofu you get the soft kind this is the soft tofu.
so , that is huge cubes.
but that 's OK, will you stir that if it 's too small, it 's very easy to get that smooshed into even smaller pieces.
we do n't OK and then skelly.
and this is for garnish later.
i 'm going to cut this small pieces like that coloring it 's mostly going to look like pork and tofu.
so that 's like white and brown so it 's nice to get some green in there.
pork is already ground poor.
so that 's i got at the supermarket and you do n't need to do anything else with the court.
so there once the tofu in the scally is ready i 'm going to get the walk and i 'm going to start cooking.
so the walk is up.
i 'm going to start by heating this an adding cooking oil.
i have here, is some olive oil, and i 'm going to add that and let that heat up.
and while we 're waiting for the cooking oil to get ready.
let 's review the steps for this recipe, so, first cut the tofu into cubes and then heating the walk, which is what we 're doing, right.
now we 're going to fry the ground pork later, then, they add the tofu, some water, and then we 're going to add the sauce that magic sauce then bring it to boil, and that 's done.
so that 's the only six steps a very famous, well known chinese dish that you can see it almost any restaurant, and you 'll need to do that.
and you see how simple it is.
legend has it that the name markle came from the person who created this dish.
her name was small, and she created this tofu with her special recipe.
here broke down and then became known as the dish using her name services with boiled jumping out.
so what you want to do is stir well, and then separate the core.
so it 's not in big chunks.
one and small very small pieces would be a turning fire very quickly if you see some big shots just take this pressure and rest and when it 's all peach color, then it 's time to add it to food.
all right, adding a total right now, no stir that with the poor, but be careful.
you do n't want to accidentally cut all the tofu anymore that you already have make sure they stay like shoes.
OK , what do we do next?
we add some water that 's just one cup of water, and it 's always good.
if you have a measuring cup so that was for oil, you get a clean one hey at this cup, and now i 'm gonna get the sauce ready.
see how is it.
is this all the flavors here package for you?
the one that i got is mildly hot.
mapo tofu is usually hot.
so you can choose how, how spicy you want this to be even some of them are not there, there.
some there are not that quite that hot.
if you can find him at supermarkets, but my advice.
if you do n't eat spicy food start learning through the spicy food 'cause really that 's a whole different flavor, you can have if you, if you learn how to eat spicy food OK i 'm going to jump, please mix the sauce with tofu, an with the pork and there 's one more small package which i 'm going to add later this is potato starch, and that thick is the dish.
so it 's not.
so soupy trying very, very hard not to damage my tofu.
so far i think i 'm OK.
so our plan is wait till this boils and i 'm going to app potato starch should be soon this is already boiling.
so the final step is remembered this secret recipe here is just potato starch.
so i 'm going to add that to the dish to think in it and what i do, is add some water mix that together it makes it well, and add it to this she have here make sure you stir OK.
so when she had a potato starch gently stir and is ready.
now i 'm serving this in a big bowl and i am very sad to tell you that my tofu cubes that we started with in the beginning has turned into ground to food you can see that well, it 's gonna take some practice for me and for you.
so just prepare for that is still taste delicious it just does n't look like tofu cubes that 's OK, practice makes perfect.
now after you have this in a bowl now, you can garnish that with scallion and make sure this is the last step 'cause you want to scale into stay on top looks nice that way.
so that makes it with before garnish later and there.
this is the very easy and very well, known recipe.
and we made it in list in ten minutes.
so here 's a dish for today.
mokola tofu ann in chinese milpool.
thank you for watching on my walk.
i am chef louise.
if i can cook, you can cook next time.
