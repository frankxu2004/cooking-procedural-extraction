insight presents in the kitchen with jennifer, the fit foodie, brought you by the great american spice company.
hi , i 'm jennifer right.
you 're fit booty.
i 'm so excited to share with you today.
an amazing salad that 's perfect for spring or summer, is called a fattoush salad, also known as a lebanese peasant salad.
so easy, so fun to make starting out with just taking one cucumber chop.
it up really small.
put it in your bowl.
then we have a yellow pepper.
you could use red or orange whatever flavor you like and then really pretty tomatoes.
i like the blend of the yellow.
the red the orange a few green onions.
you can also use read on the end if you prefer that prefer the red onions.
and then the most important ingredient for the salad portion itself is fresh herbs today.
we have a mixture of parsley immense, you always have to use meant to make it up a two salad.
but you can add in cilantro and some other herbs.
if you prefer to do that instead of the parsley and one of the little tips that i learned recently that i really like is how to cut herbs.
so they do n't get to realty on you.
so we have some really pretty meant today, and some really pretty parsley.
and it 's going to grab them both together.
this is called dial technique used chop up your herbs.
and then once you get a nice chop we 're just going to sundial.
so take your knife just like a sundial, go back and forth, and it gives you that really nice chopped herb without getting will T.
and that 's great.
so minutes is one of those herbs that can take a while to get used to so start out with a small amount of mint.
let your taste buds get used to it and soon enough.
you will find that you absolutely love the flavor of mint going to fix this around my parents.
my grandparents actually farmed fresh mints when i was young.
so i 've always love the smell of it and love working with it, so i hope you do too.
so we 've got our salad and now for the vinaigrette.
we 're going to take fresh lemon juice a lot of it.
and that 's really healthy for her body helps create an alkaline existence and a little bit of olive oil going to pour that in some fresh garlic has to be fresh.
it ca n't be the powdered a little salt and pepper and then our star ingredient is called.
fresh sumac is this brilliant there kind of reminds me of like the arizona clay colors is brilliant clay colored, spice.
it 's dried berry from the mediterranean, they dry it down.
and they crushed it into the spice called sumac is really good for digestion.
and it 's loaded down with antioxidants, so it 's really great.
for you is known as a spice in the mediterranean in greece and turkey and lebanon is not something that we use a lot around here.
but it 's something that we should.
you can replace your table salt and pepper with some really great flavor.
and it has a little bit of a citrus, zest to it, so it also goes great with your vinegar rets.
so we 're going to all these things together.
and then we 're going to pour the salad dressing actually half of it half of it is poured over the salad get messy.
have fun with it is part of fun is cooking with your hands.
it smells delicious fresh lemon without sumac, mixed in if you 're a lemon person, you will love this recipe.
so good with that fresh mint.
and then we 're going to throw in some pita chips.
so i have a whole wheat, pita chip that you just toast in your oven, you can also buy them in a bag, too.
many places sell them.
and then once you throw and the pita chip, you want to take the reserve dressing and pour over the pita chip itself, so, i think this may be why it 's called a peasant salad.
they would use day old bread and make it into the salad to create a little bit more substance with the cell itself.
so you want to allow the pita chips it kind of soaked in with this really yummy.
and then there we simply played.
it , on a really pretty plate like this, and i love white plates for summer with really fresh ingredients.
and we 're going to take a bite of this, really yummy salad it is so good, and it is so fresh.
one of the things i 'd like to point out about sumac is this is not a spice that you can buy at any grocery store, the great american spice companies that place that you have to go to get it if you want to find the sumac.
