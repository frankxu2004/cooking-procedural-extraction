hi , i 'm josh summers with high country salmon and today we 're going to fillet a salmon OK.
so now we 're going to sushi me this phillip internet, check over again, and if we were doing.
so she me in the shop here at high country salmon we sort of thought i quick way.
i 'm sure it 's slightly different than proper sushi chefs would do it.
but here in the shop we go through.
so much that we have to do it quite fast.
so what we do is we cut the pin bones out.
so you want to just put your knife just behind the pen bones here.
run it along.
not all the way down to sort of work your way down and the idea is to try and get them out with this little flesh stuck to them.
it is possible, and i should just go right down to the bottom, see.
i 've gone right down and it opens it up and, if you just run your finger along you can fill with the end, which this apparently is somewhere and just.
do the same on the other side?
it was question, you can get just something like that now.
this , but is quite tricky.
the pin bones go down on an angle that way towards the tail diagonally.
so if you just run your knife sort of diagonally down sort of, failed him within just like that game dancing terylene lifted up cat litter off in.
do we have to fill it, read it to be cut into shaming and from here what we 're going to do is?
we 're going to cut this fill it into three pieces.
so we were going to have the loin now, which is this top.
but here the belly, which is the bottom, but, and, then just the middle face, which run right down to about right down to it.
so i 'm just going to cut.
they look there and then sort of half way between the top of this, but in the bottom, write down there and then from there.
we lift with the belly, which again we can cut.
we can cut this again if we wanted to alliance of the first shoulder grain as we say, runs that way.
and then it changes in it goes that way.
so we just want to cut where you can see the angle changes like that just leave in four different places, this problems.
but those aside just kept each one slightly differently.
yeah , just the metal piece here.
most people like it thin, however, in some asian countries can i look at thick.
so we just want to help cut it like that wolverine.
this sort of keeping your thing is out of the way sort of, moving them down this is true.
shut up all the way to the tail and generally, we would n't use the tailing.
the gifts quite then also quite, quite chilly.
so we would generally just use these boots, we 've got just put those.
there is a nice, nice pile ever did, so the next.
if there 's a loin or the top part of the phillip and this one 's slightly different, it 's quite a few ways, ways that it can be done.
but generally, it 's cut with the grain.
so you can say the lines on it, they sort of and then sort of almost a V shape, and just go to there and what we want to do is just sort of cut down on an angle, like.
so cortana, i 'm sorry dispensers, are those up there like a bit more room, and it 's very important just concentrate when you 're doing this.
make sure you think is a well, out of the way before you pull the knife back and again.
generally would n't lose the input just for presentation purposes there and next we have and the top half of the belly.
and so this.
but you can see the grain runs on an angle that way which would be towards the top heating of the phillip.
but it 's still on the fish and we want to cut against the grain on this one.
so because the lines around this way we 're going to cut on an angle, down that way.
so we just, i do n't know right.
so that go all the way to end with this one stop it, a nice file.
all these are from the side so you can see which, which parts of a fish with god and mix forgot the bottom of the belly button and again.
i 'm going to run thanks to grind.
so turn it over this grain is running that way just go out there, this puts generally nice and thin.
because they barely is a lot chillier than the rest of the first and so.
the centre of those written test, i mean, cutting shaming, an the japanese.
they , they cut each individual part of the fish.
so that each different part is the same texture and field in the mouth, which is why they separate three different parts of the phillip.
because each one has different grind.
so it can be look up.
so that has same, same field in the mouth.
and that 's how we do see me.
