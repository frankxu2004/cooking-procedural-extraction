did i cause today?
i 'm going to show you how i make onion rings now.
these are a great snack and their beautiful, and crispy and very easy to make.
so i 'm going to start by making the better here.
i 've got a half cup of plain flour, a quarter cup of corn flour.
now this helps the better become nice and light and crispy and by secret ingredient two tablespoons of oat flour now, this gives the better some nice body and crunch and compliments the cornflower.
well , so at the flowers to a ball, then, add one egg.
a half cup of water teaspoon of salt is that a spoon of sugar mixed together well.
do you get a nice smooth thick batter?
latest A stand for half an hour so that out flail can hydrate properly.
and while that 's happening cut your onions into one centimeter, thick slices.
and then remove the center rings so you just have the larger outer rings remaining.
so here i 've got my onion rings.
my better and some panko bread crumbs.
they can use regular bread crumbs if you like.
rings place it in the better make sure all excess batter is run off then lightly coat in the bread crumbs just repeat this step for all of your onion rings.
and now it 's time to cook on shallow frying these in some oil and what i 'm doing here is just using a piece of bread to tell when the oil is ready.
so when it sizzles like that it 's time to put in those onion rings now.
there 's a very quick to cook.
they only take about thirty seconds per side, turning once and when they 're done carefully remove them from the oil and place them onto a wire rack.
so the excess oil can run off, and this is what you get guys absolutely beautiful.
enjoy as you can hear their beautiful and crispy be sure to give these ago they are delicious thanks for watching, and i 'll catch you all next time.
