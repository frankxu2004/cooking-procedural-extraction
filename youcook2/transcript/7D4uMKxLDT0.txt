what 's up guys.
this is derek house from D H F D, N S dot com and today.
i 'm going to show you guys how to make my body building chicken parma, john.
simple and more than calorie, friendly.
so , let 's get to it.
the first thing you 're going to do is seek out one and a half pounds or twenty.
four ounces of chicken breast trim the fat off of them and then cut each piece and a half this way.
so for every chicken breasts that you have you should end up with two pieces that are about this big.
after you slice your chicken breast put it off to the side and then take out two bowls.
one small one and one medium size.
one , one thing i do want to mention really quick.
if you want to prep enough for the whole week, you can easily double or even triple this recipe.
now , the first thing we 're going to add into the small bowl is two extra large egg white and then one tablespoon of olive oil go ahead and lightly mix those together the first thing, you 're going to add into the medium size bowl is two thirds a cup, or sixty grams of whole wheat bread crumbs, whether or not you want to use seasoned ones is completely up to you.
and then eight tablespoons or forty grams of grated parmesan cheese mix.
both of those together next preheat your oven on four fifty take out a baking sheet and then code it with some non stick cooking spray.
put your chicken breasts onto your baking sheet.
take out a pastry brush and then brush each chicken breast with your wet mix.
after you brush your chicken breasts dip it into your dry mix, if there 's any dry mix leftover just evenly distributed across the top of your chicken breasts last before the oven, cook the top of each chicken breast with some non stick cooking spray and then into the oven, on four fifty for twenty minutes after twenty minutes take them out, flip them over.
and then evenly distribute half a cup or a hundred and twenty.
three grams of pasta sauce across the tops of them and then three fourths, a cup, or eighty four grams of reduced fat mozzarella cheese.
after that put them back into the oven on four fifty for around five to ten minutes or until your cheese is melted after ten minutes for me.
it does look done.
so i 'm just going to take it out, and there is your body building chicken parmesan.
three quick tips one.
you could use whatever type of pasta sauce you want, today.
i 'm using a, no salt added, one, but, for example, sometimes they like it spicy.
so use a spicy pasta sauce two.
you can eat this with keen wah, rice pasta beans, laffy, taffy or whatever.
you prefer an three.
a silicone pastry brush is a great investment for your kitchen.
this one only costs around eight dollar ship is easy to clean dishwasher safe and will last, you forever post a link to this one in the description below as you guys saw the chicken parmesan is done.
so now i 'm just going to try by it, so if scarface was a bodybuilder that dealt chicken parmesan instead of cocaine.
this would be the best seller of the flavors of a chicken parmesan.
are there absolutely delicious?
as far as the calories go in the whole recipe there 's one thousand five hundred.
fifteen forty, three grams of fat fifty five grams of carbs and two hundred and twenty.
seven grams of protein, so, if you divide this up in a six servings like i do in each serving there 's going to be around two hundred fifty two calories.
seven grams of that nine grams of carbs and thirty eight grams of protein, so i have a question for you guys.
since this was one of my favorite meals growing up what were some of your favourites.
