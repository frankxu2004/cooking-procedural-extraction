it 's a soup that you hear about all the time and for every different family, there 's a different recipe.
here 's my nan.
i hope you enjoy it in your soup pot.
you 're going to start off by cooking a little bit of pancetta just until it 's crispy, then you 're going to reduce the heat and add carrots.
so , the hot pepper flakes you want to cook that for about five minutes just until it 's soft, do n't forget the salt and pepper?
add your breath and tomatoes and bring it to the boil.
after that you 're going to add your beans.
anuta tally pasta any small possible work.
but the tubes are one of my favourites.
you want to simmer your suit for about twenty minutes until the pasta is nice and tender with a spinach and cook for about three minutes.
you want it wilted and bright green.
and you have to finish it off with some fresh herbs like basil and parsley.
it 'll be a perfect meal for your family to share.
