alright here we go with our croak, monsour, my favorite open face sandwich, and i had that cheesy, bechamel, leftover.
so here 's what i 'm going to do with it.
i 'm going to take a live on bread.
this is just a classic french country loaf of bread.
the round oval kind round oval.
i guess it 's gotta.
be one or the other, i guess it 's round, so we 're going to cut four nice big thick slices right out of the center.
so i 'm not going to use the two end pieces.
all right important since we 're going to go these in the oven, they gotta be the same thickness.
otherwise , you know, one is going to cook faster than the other.
so those are good.
three quarters of an inch thick, i 'm going to drizzle about.
i do n't know tablespoon olive oil on one side.
i 'm going to flip him over alright, so there 's olive oil on the bottom.
i 'm going to take my cheesy, bechamel sauce now if you do n't know where i got that.
or how that came to be you gotta watch two clips on the site, the bechamel clip.
and then the beginning of the cheese souffle clip where i added the cheese so it 's basically a cheese infused.
i use clear achieves infused times scented bay channel, and i 'm put in a nice thick coding on each of these slices.
so there 's about a half a cup of bascom, elementary spread between four, so, if my math serves me correctly, it was an eighth of a cup.
all right now, here 's an important tip, here go all the way to the edges of the bread 'cause it 's going to go in a hot oven, and we do n't want the edges to burn.
so if it 's covered all the way to the edge with the bechamel you do n't have to worry about that alright.
so make sure full coverage now.
what you top these would up to you, i mean, that 's kind of obvious right.
but i 'm going to use the traditional, or one of the traditional combos here.
this is some nice smoky black forest ham want to do.
maybe three or four thin slices per just like pizza you do n't want too much topping.
if you get too much topping it 's just it 's too much less.
is more so few slices smoking ham is traditional?
all right on top of that.
i 'm going to use a nice ripe.
and if you ca n't find a ripe, tomato do n't even bother OK.
do n't put some pink nearly supermarket tomato on there?
so i 'm going to put a couple sizes on each.
and i did n't show it.
i want to save time.
i did a little salt pepper and tomato and i 'm going to top it with a couple tablespoons of grated melty cheese.
now what will work here.
any kind of swiss cheddar i actually used fontina, which is a nice my favorite shoes.
i had some in the fridge so again, you do n't want so much that it just turns into a big giant cloud.
but she 's so a couple of tablespoons of cheese is plenty my battery.
jack would work great here.
pepper jack all right, and if you ca n't choose this is not the best.
not the best demo to be watching sorry about that.
but if you do, there 's nothing better to top it off i 'm going to take a some hard grating cheese.
pecorino , romano would work this is a reggiano parmesan.
so just a, just a little sprinkling.
this is going to help with the colour, so going to give it just a little extra layer of flavor.
so , put just maybe a half a teaspoon, reggiano on each and then just to finish this off.
real late drizzling of the extra virgin olive oil.
maybe a half a teaspoon and those are ready for a hot oven.
so i bake these at four hundred, till they were done.
now how long do they take they took about fifteen twenty minutes, but you gotta, check on what you want.
golden brown on the top and the bottom is because we had a lot of oil on the pan.
the bottom just crisp up a little bit.
so , you know, after fifteen minutes, check it.
look underneath, but that 's which is supposed to look like when it 's done.
and , that is a beautiful, beautiful open face sandwich.
again you cut into that there 's a little creamy layer.
that time infused cheese bechamel underneath your.
ham , your cheese your tomato.
these are great with asparagus.
i 've seen it done with broccoli, i mean, you can top it with anything.
but , but this is really nice lunch.
great picnic item and one last tip much better room temperature than they are hot out of the oven first value.
burn the heck out of your mouth, and you just ca n't taste all the different flavors.
so let these cool down to room temperature.
and then i think he got something anyway.
give these a try and enjoy.
