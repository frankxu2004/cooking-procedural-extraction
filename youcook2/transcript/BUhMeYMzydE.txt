i 've been making this probably three years ago, yeah, i think i have done a good job getting the ingredients correct.
so i hope you guys enjoy.
let 's get started in a large pot.
you 're going to melt half a cup of butter include all the exact ingredients in the information box on a blog posts.
next door, ready to saute onion until they are brown.
you 're ready to add a variety of bell peppers.
i use yellow and i also use red you can also use green bell peppers if you like and say that with the onions.
now you 're ready to add celery next.
add your seasonings were going to add time as well as baileys.
and then you 're going to remove the baileys after cooking dailies are usually just for aroma, and we 're going to saute for about five minutes until the onions have completely brown.
now you 're ready to add potatoes, add your potatoes and mix that in giving a good mix it with all those veggies now, you 're ready to add the clam juice for all the clam juice in after adding the clam juice.
you 're going to add worchester sauce.
gonna mix it a little bit.
and you 're gonna go ahead, and boil.
this , for about three minutes.
now that we have boiled the clam juice with the vegetables are ready to add your clams if you can find fresh clams you can use, can plants an i like to include the canned clams with the juice, 'cause that 's extra clam, juice and you 're just going to make satin.
next year, going to mix half and half in flower together an flower and happen.
have will pick in the soup base?
now , you 're ready to pour the half and, half and flour mixture.
make sure to thoroughly stir an.
i like to heat this up on medium for about five more minutes, and then you 'll be ready to enjoy this is completely optional.
but if you like a little spice, i suggest adding some sarrah, cha and go ahead and mix.
i recommend adding less than more, just because everyone has a different spice level.
and you 're just going to mix that in an after mix again, and you 're ready to enjoy.
just grab yourself a bowl and scoop yourself some delicious clam chowder, soup your clam chowder is ready.

oh , my god, that is so good.
you know, i notice that you put bigger clams in at this time.
so i love that you add more of the ingredient that we actually love.
this is so good and a little bit of spice to it i 'm guessing.
you put three rochat in it.
yes , oh, man is so fantastic.

i feel like clam chowder is such a perfect fall love, taking it for work, or you just leaving him for dinner just this, you know, and it 's good with rich crackers.
