hi , i 'm ariga, ragna with MGB special events in arlington, virginia, and today i 'm showing you how to make a romantic dinner for two for your special valentine.
and right now we 're going to work on the escargot.
our appetizer for today and this is what you 're going to need in order to do it.
we 're going to need some nice dishes for baking escargot.
if you have them, if not you could take a pyrex dish.
just anything that 's oven proven safe.
an you can put it in the oven, that way we 're going to need some garlic, some chopped fresh chives.
some cleaned and rinsed, escargot salt i 'd like to use white pepper for this.
some cooking, sherry, will need some butter, softened already a bowl, a fork and a garlic press started on our escargot, appetizer.
OK , so make sure that you thoroughly rinse off your escargot under cool water.
she 's a kolander or you could use a bowl.
but you could see there 's, you know, if not that this is bad, but those little parts in there just gently rensing.
you could run them under if there 's anything that 's hanging on just pull it off.
nice and then we 're going to go ahead and pat them dry.
and we 're going to use six, six for me and six for you for your romantic date for valentine 's day, remember always wash your hands.
OK , we 've already got it softened.
so , i like to use a fork just to mix it up.
get it nice and mushy, OK, and we 're going to take, you know, probably two or three cloves of garlic can have enough garlic.
and we 're pressing it so that all we really getting out of this is really the garlic juice.
the skin we can toss aside OK press another one you could chop this if you want, but i love using the garlic press.
it 's so simple.
it 's so easy and i like the results that i get out of it.
so i 'm going to probably do, i mean, we 're only doing twelve escargot today six for me six for you.
and so i 'm going to use about three cloves of garlic.
OK , that 's done just some chives, i guess maybe a tablespoon or tablespoon and a half little salt i like to use white pepper.
it is a little bit stronger.
so you have to go a little easier on it, then you would regular pepper and then cooking sherry you can get this at the grocery store, you do n't have to buy an expensive sherry just any kind of cooking sherry and i 'm going to slowly put that in till i figure after i get the right consistency.
and i might have to add more.
but for the mean time, i 'm just going to add just a little bit and just marry all of those ingredients together.
and you can smell it already.
it smells wonderful, you can use this as a basis for so many other different things.
you could use this as a butter on filetes today.
we 're not going to do that, you could use this on fish you could use it on chick in just about anything.
it 's just a wonderful base to make your foods taste so well, OK.
makes it all up together now, in our handy dandy little escargot dishes here i 'm going to go ahead.
and i 'm just going to put a little dial up.
let 's do it this way, just a little, doll up at the bottom of each one of these.
just so that, when we put the escargot in it does n't.
it does n't burn, or has a nice little base on the bottom.
now , as it, as it cooks it 's going to all.
it 's going to totally submerge the little escargot is exactly what we want to do alright.
let 's mine now, of course, if you have an extra this it 's not a problem.
i 'd rather have more than less do n't have to go back and do all the steps again.
and this is a very, very simple appetizer, but it 's sure to please your valentine OK.
all right now, we 're just going to simply take in escargot.
pop it in there.
the nice thing about these dishes is that there 's room to have it the butter when it melts to cover it up and you see there 's a little rim here, it makes it nice, this pop.
each one of those in hopefully, i counted right perfect OK.
now we 're going to take the rest of our butter and just put it on top.
an , i tell you, this is so good, especially after you 've eaten all your escargot.
then you want to take some nice butter bread and dip it in this juice.
it 's so good.
now i 've already got my oven preheated at three.
fifty , and it really does not take very long to cook this fifteen eighteen minutes, or until it 's bubbling 'cause the escargot is already cooked.
so you just going to get it basically good in hot and it usually only fifteen, or eighteen minutes.
OK , i like to put it on a cookie sheet case.
it does happen to overflow.
it 's got lined with tin foil, and it wo n't make your oven all messy OK, so let 's go on over to the oven.
so here we have our escargot.
it 's been in the oven for fifteen minutes at three fifty, and as you 'll see, you know, when it 's ready 'cause it 's nice and bubbly and hot and it is gorgeous look at that, and it just smells.
so amazing i wish you could smell it, and this is a wonderful way to start off your romantic valentine 's dinner and.
