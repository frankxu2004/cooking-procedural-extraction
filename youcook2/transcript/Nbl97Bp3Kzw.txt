i live on top of the hill.
but every day, i go down to the village to buy the food that i 'm going to cook that night, welcome to what 's left of the italian american neighborhood in san francisco.
and this is my north beach.
i 'm cooking calamari, flete.
i 'm going to do some fried squid for you today, very simple.
it 's very quick.
and i wanted to try to get another fish recipe for you becaus we 're coming close to the christmas season, and, you know, i 'm going to do a post about the italian tradition of seven fish dinner.
so this kalimati fleet these one that i was including my christmas eve, seven fish dinner.
i 'm going to make it for you today.
we got some local monterrey squid really beautiful.
i 've got some of the tubes that i 'm just going to slice in rings and a lot of people they do n't like tentacles.
i love the tentacles.
this is more flavorful part of the column on me.
so i 'm going to.
i 'm going to fry those up to the only thing, i 'm going to do is dreads these in flower, and i 'm just putting some freshly ground, black pepper in this flower, and i 'm going to give it a fairly good amount of my sicilian cecil.
so these are vinegar peppers.
i 'm going to take a couple of these cause.
they 're pretty color.
and i 'm going to take one of these firecrackers when it is collaborating hot peppers are going to mix them together, we 're going to put him in that slot, a pan with a little oil, it would be nice festive colors.
let me see, if they still taste good.
but i wanna get a little bit more heat than what i 'm getting from the vinegar in those vinegar peppers.
so i 'm going to slice this one up seeds and all, now.
if you 're using these colombian peppers at least when i use it.
i , gotta warn people reading these dishes cause this could get hot.
so i said i wanted confetti.
so i 'm just going this way and these spices.
a little smaller pieces, we 're going to let this come to tip a little bit.
and then we 're just going to saute these a little bit and put him aside that should be fun, though.
so let these just kind of mellow out a little bit in the oil.
get a little color in the oil and bring these peppers up to temp.
so that 's pretty much where i 'm going to where i 'm going to leave.
i 'm going to put him on the side here.
so as i put it in i 'm going to be taping it off.
but the oils at the right temperature.
so want to get this in it 's going to fry very quickly.
but this pretty quick process.
so if you get your heat going at the right temperature you want to get this in.
and you want to get in fried up quickly so, see how they 're just starting to take on that color.
just a light tan, they just need another minute, or so not even amid and we 're going to take him out.
do that and you just want to cook through?
but you do n't want him over cook.
be cause, then they 're going to tend to get, to get tough.
just picked up a little bit and see that the very light tan color, that 's what we 're looking for.
and he 's going to be good eating.
it is one of those tentacles.
so here we go so, these things.
usually if i 'm trying these on for, you know, for the seven fish dinner.
people are going to come around.
we 're going to sprinkle this with salt, and they 're going to eat him right here.
they never make it to the table, so maybe we 'll have to do that over here to let me put some over here.
look at this beautiful, beautiful, beautiful OK now.
i think i 'm going to have enough flavor here from these peppers that i do n't need to squeeze it a limit.
but you could always do that if you want, let me just taste a couple for you grab, this one.
a little bit of the pepper freshness of the see.
how quick was this took me about five minutes to make it for you, right i got i wanted these is my favorite part.
christmas is comments ever.
dinner , christmas eve you gotta make dollar body fleet on apathy blow.
