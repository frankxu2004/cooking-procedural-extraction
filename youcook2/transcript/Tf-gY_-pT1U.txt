hi , i 'm maria.
and i love to cook merry christmas everyone today.
is christmas eve, and i am making our standard christmas eve dinner in our family, which is perogy 's and kabah see and to get started on the perrot guy 's i need to peel about seven large red skin potatoes?
and i 'm going to cook these in a pot of boiling water until there done.
and then i 'm going to use them in the filling, and i 'm going to make sure to save the potato water.
because that 's key for the perogy dough.
this recipe comes to me from my mother in lots of authentic polish perogy recipe and the people contributing to it.
i 'm going to try to read their names, cry owsiak segment and ladder, which recipe for perogy.
so i 'm going to get these potatoes boiling and be back when the.
next step, well, my potatoes are boiling.
i went ahead and chopped up too large.
but dahlia onions into small can pieces, very finely chopped, and i 've met a whole stick of butter that do n't be alarmed about the quantity of butter.
because this recipe makes a lot of perot, geese, and i 'm going to saute my onions in the butter to get started on my filling as soon as the butter melts and potatoes are cooked and i drained them careful to reserve two cups of water potato water, the water that you drain from the pot is really important for the dough for the perrot guy 's.
so dump it down the sink.
i put my sauteed onions in a big bowl.
and i went ahead and graded half a pound of organic colby cheese.
and i 'm going to add this to my onions, and then i 'm going to mash the potatoes into this mixture, and that 'll be one of my feelings for my perot gets ice.
you do n't know progress is sort of like polish ravioli, at least that 's how i think of them.
so , now i 'm going to go ahead and mash the potatoes in then i 'll add a little bit of salt and pepper.
next i 'll make the dough.
i 'm making my perogy dough and what i 've done is to measure three cups, and i 'm going to add another four cups of flour into this bowl.
and then here i have two tablespoons, unsalted butter that i saw to that.
i 'm going to add new egg yolks, and there 's a little bit of egg shell in there happens, sometimes just get that out.
i need another a joke, so i 'm going to separate my egg, and then i 'm going to add to my egg yolks and butter.
two tablespoons of sour cream clinic, separate air with karen perfect.
so two tablespoons of sour cream in this dell is really delightful to work with one tablespoon, and this is where we 're going to use that potato water that we saved.
when we had boiled potatoes as well, so what you 're going to do is just combine diego with the sour cream and butter.
then i 'm going to make a well in the center of my flower and add these ingredients.
can i 'm going to add one and half black?
so i 've used a fork to sort of cut in my egg.
yolk butter and sour cream mixture.
now going to add one and a half cups of potato water a little bit at a time.
so that i can incorporate it, and then i 'm going to meet the dough, and it makes a soft though.
but it 's a very workable easy work with them.
and then i 'm going to cover the dough with a kitchen towel or damp paper.
and let it rest for ten minutes before i roll it out.
so here 's my dough came together really nicely.
and what i 'm going to do is cover it now and let it rest for ten minutes.
and i 'm going to bring a large pot of water to a boil on the stove.
because once i feel my brodies, i 'm going to boil, it.
and then once you 're done being cooked in the water when it 's time to serve them all soft haven, and some butter with some additional sauteed onions this day was such a joy to work with such nice, though and that rolls it out on a floured board.
so about an eighth of an inch thickness and.
now what i 'm going to do is cut three inch rams and fill them, sam I three inch rounds for my first bash i 'm gonna make you get bring my water back up to a boil and then using flower fingers, i 'm going to pinch theurgy shut up.
now fulfilling i put a scant teaspoon of filling you always want to put a lot of filling in and that 's a mistake.
because raviolis, rogez blonde times anything that you 're filling what will happen is it 'll burst it wo n't stay together.
so just scant teaspoon into the lower half of each circle and then you use flower hands to crimp the edges together i 'm going to go ahead and show you this from the top you can see how much filling.
so as you can see it 's just a scant teaspoon of filling and then i 'm going to fold over the perogy it 's hard to do with one hand and just pinched the edges, shut my water 's boiling.
so i 'm going to go ahead like grows into the boiling water, and do n't wanna, overcrowd them.
so depending on the size of hot you 're using maybe sixty eight perot keys at a time they all float to the surface and once they floated to the surface cook them for an additional two minutes and then remove them with a slotted spoon and lay them not touching on last paper, line trace then you could put them in the refrigerator if you 're going to eat them tonight and take him out later on saute them in butter and serve them with some sauteed on yet, or you can freeze them not touching on wax paper when the frozen solid pop both wax paper implemented zip lock back and here are the perrot guy 's after they 've been boiled and, i 've laid them on wax paper, and i 'm going to just cover them with some plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator.
because i 'm going to fry him up and butter with some sauteed onion tonight and serve them with some kabah, see, for a delicious christmas eve dinner.
so here they are, my perogies i took them out of the refrigerator and sauteed them in melted butter with some onions and i played them up with some kabah see and some green beans, happy cooking.
