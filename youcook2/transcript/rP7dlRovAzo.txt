hey guys, we love english beef noodle soup at the restaurant.
so today we 're going to show you how to make it yourself at home guys at me, and i 'm sammy.
and today we will be making one of our favorite suzanne.
this is our favorite one of my favourites.
if this is the beef noodle soup cell, first will need angus beef.
and this is this doing kind of, already comes chopped up and cute and try to get the one with the fatter cuts.
because it 's going to be more tasty.
base you 're going to need one tomato.
you can introduce the onion.
oh , you already said itself.
and you 're going to need three cloves of garlic peeled.
and the next thing we 're going to need is a spice and this is.
star , tennis star anise is using a lot of traditional asian soups.
so first thing you 'll need is sugar and this is right around when you need one third of this, this is only for cooking this do n't drink it on its own, and then you 'll need to have the cup of regular soy sauce.
we like medical story stuff.
this is the mushroom flavored one.
it 's a thicker one.
it 's going to get the soup.
it 's colored on these shanghai bok, choy, and then you 'll need.
shanghai noodles this is assuming you 'll find a variety of noodles in the middle section and make sure it says.
this is something that i find makes it.
what it is this is the pickled mustard, green it 's so, so yummy.
it 's got a sour sweet taste to it.
i 'd love to put this on top with beef, noodle soup wants to cook with vegetable and the noodle and yeah, you can get this in every supermarket and make sure when you get it must say pickled mustard green, not just the.
now they have a lot of variety, and this, and this is optional.
so people do n't know.
really hate cilantro.
but i like it.
just an extra vegetables for you guys that like to eat your greens to prepare vegetables, cut them into large chunks because they will dissolve into the soup base.
cut your pickle mustard greens into tiny pieces because the taste is really strong.
this actually goes into the soup at the very end when it 's ready to serve and.
now to prepare the soup base, add beef into three liters of boiling water, next, at three cloves of peeled girls then answer tomato and onions and to the soup address star anise, then add all your liquid ingredients.
mixture soup, and simmer for five hours to all those delicious flavors can come out into the soup, and you 'll know when it 's done when everything is dissolved.
so here we both the greens with one tablespoon of oil, and we also boiled the noodle for one minute, and then you put all these things together and pour the hot soup on top.
and this is what you 'll get this is one of our favorite things to eat in the wintertime.
it 's so delicious, it 's great for the cold winter nights, and it always satisfies my tummy.
it is definitely one of our favorite comfort foods, let us know what yours is thanks for watching guys.
hope you guys give it a try and have a great day.
