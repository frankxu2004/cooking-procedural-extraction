you want to stand.
hello , everyone and welcome to another cooking video.
my name is jay going to continue this week in our journey with rice today.
i got this bowl of rice and screaming for something to put on it.
so we 're going to look at a korean recipe today, called bibinba, bibimbap simply means mixed rice.
so we 're going to take a look at some of the toppings and some of the ingredients, and i 'm going to show you how easy this is to do.
so you ready.
let 's do it.
i 'm going to start this recipe off.
right i got some roasted garlic here that it just drizzled with olive oil and put in a three hundred and fifty degree oven for about forty minutes.
now , meanwhile, i got browning here some ground beef that i had seasoned with a boat, half a teaspoon of sugar saki soy sauce and sesame E oil as well as some garlic powder and some salt and pepper and was going to brown that.
and then we 're going to set it aside, OK for the spinach.
all i did was i put it in the steamer and just let her go until it was wilted moving on to the carrots and cucumbers.
all we did was julie into a matchstick size.
OK , i got a hot pan here and i just added about two cups of my talk, it, i 'm going to do is i 'm going to toss them around slightly and then i 'm going to add our base for a sauce, which we 're going to use about a tablespoon each of soy sauce.
mirin and sugar now we 're going to do is we 're going to just cook that down until it 's reduced into a nice thick sauce.
OK now what you want to do is grab a little handful of bean sprouts there and put it in a hot pan.
and you just want to saute them for about thirty to forty five seconds, now add a dash of sesame E oil.
if you like just for a little bit of flavor now finally, with the carrot we 're just going to cook it slightly for maybe about thirty seconds.
we 're going to get booze a bit of the natural sweetness out, and then we 're going to move on, so, let 's move on to the sauce.
OK , let 's start with our goal to jiang sauce.
the first thing we 're going to need is we 're going to need three tablespoons of go to john, which is a pepper paste that you can get an asian supermarket or the korean grocery to that we 're going to add about a half a teaspoon of soy sauce.
one teaspoon of vinegar one teaspoon of roasted sesame E seeds.
in addition to one teaspoon of sesame E oil now, to that we 're going to add one of those bulbs of our roasted garlic so just squeeze it.
there , an AT teaspoon of honey now, we 're going to want to do with that is just mix real well, until everything is incorporated.
you could put it in a blender if you like as well just to make sure that, that garlic is, well blended.
now when you get that roasted garlic out it 's going to be beautiful it 's, gonna be like butter.
so softap so do n't be worried about using so much garlic because once you roasted it turns sweet.
so it 's not as over powerful as when he use it when it is fresh, so go nuts OK for their cilantro sauce with the roast.
garlic emulsion very excited about the sauce by the way, but i 'm going to use a bunch of fresh cilantro.
one bulb of that roasted garlic now.
let 's say two bulbs are the roasted garlic.
the juice from three lines in about half a cup of canola oil and all you gotta do is buzz that in the blender until it 's well incorporated.
then once that 's done.
give it taste at some salt and pepper to season, and then you are done OK, finally, we 're going to poach our egg.
an if you do n't know how to do that, check out my poached egg video OK so finally.
here we are at the assembly of our dish, so we 're going to start by getting our sauteed.
bean sprouts , there.
and we 're just going to lay our ingredients around the edge of the bull.
so we got our bean sprouts there and then we 're going to follow up with some of that fresh cucumber followed on the opposite side with our carrots.
now just make it pretty it 's all good and take your time once, that 's done there.
i got her.
she talkie, or not hershey tucci butter.
my talking, and we 're going to put those right next to the carrots.
and when you 're laying these down just make sure you have your nice variety of colors that you 're alternating everything like that.
unlike what i did there by putting the green next to green, but whatever, so there 's our spinach, an onstar, spinach is done.
we 're going to put our ground beef right in the middle.
so put a small mound.
then the great thing about these dishes you do n't need a lot of meat.
so , do n't worry about that?
in fact, you do n't even need me at all.
you can totally make this a vegan dish.
easilly , queso, once your meat is down in the middle dare.
let 's put some of that cilantro, emulsion sauce there.
so i 'm going to put that in a couple spots there on the bowl followed by that go to jang hot pepper sauce that i 'm just going to put it right on top of the beef, perfect.
now once that 's down i 'm gonna finish, that off with our poached egg, and wears are poached egg there.
it is OK, let 's put that down.
nice and carefully rights and their good.
now , i think we have almost everything i 'm just going to finish it off with a little bit of food.
ekaki and then looks at forty copies down i 'm going to grab a.
knife , and i 'm going to cut that egg open and let it all over.
be beautiful, see check that out she had silkiness of the egg and the text year this is beautiful.
and this is going to taste incredible.
let 's give it a taste.
so here is our finished product R B bim, BAP right here in the bowl as you can see.
giver , taste test.
so the first thing we.
gotta , do we, gotta.
mix this up really good.
i 'm curious to see how the addition of that second sauce is going to be to this dish that cilantro roasted garlic emulsion sauce here.
we go to rocky moss.
there 's a good balance right there, then go to john and a wiccan edge.
traditionally , does that, but with the added cilantro and roasted garlic sauce there 's a slight herb power there, the lime juice really nice.
freshens it up i really like.
it , so that was that really good.
so that 's my version of bibimbap, so try it out at home.
try it out at home, be.
brave do n't be afraid.
make this recipe yours most importantly, though, have fun in the kitchen and until next time?
