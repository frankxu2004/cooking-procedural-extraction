hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com, with good old fashioned pancakes.
that 's right, anybody can add water to a box mix.
but you 're better than that, or at least i assume you 're better than that.
so let me show you how to make your own classic american diner style old fashion pancakes.
so easy, and here we go so step one here.
we 're going to sift.
ingredients , which is a flower just regular all purpose flour.
we 're going to add some baking not soda baking powder.
some salt and some sugar and then we 're going to see if that now, you know, i 'm not big on sifton if i 've said, it once, i 've said it a hundred times.
there 's no money in sifting, but here kind of important.
so i want you to sit at this time, once.
it 's all sifted.
we 're going to add melted butter an egg and some milk.
now one tip here.
i want you to be standing there with your whisk, ready to go as soon as you add those wet ingredients, fix this quickly.
so i pop that egg yolk.
and then i whisk vigorously until it 's combined.
now why i want you to have the wisc ready as soon as you add the wet ingredients is 'cause if you add that butter and the egg and the cold milk and then go look for the wisc and come back five minutes later that cold milk will have solidified that butter, and it just wo n't mix in as well.
so make sure you have all your stuff handy, and like i said, you 're just going to wish that until it comes together, should look like that looks like pancake batter?
i 'm going to let that sit for five minutes to give that baking powder a little chance to sort of start doing its chemical reaction thing and then you know, the rest it 's the same as if you use that package mix.
i 'm going to preheat a nice big skillet on medium high, i 'm gonna give it a little light sprain with vegetable oil.
and then i use a quarter cup measuring scoop to make my pancakes.
i like the little ones you can make giant big ones.
i guess, but i like kind of three smaller ones for serving.
and , then the classic question how do i know when to turn it well.
you 've heard the expression being able to read body language.
here you have to be able to read bubble language.
the bubbles will tell you first ignacy bubbles around the outside.
then you 're going to see bubbles come up through the middle when the bubbles come up through the middle, turn your pancake.
it works every time, so depending on your flame, depending on your pan medium, to medium, high, he should be perfect.
once you flip them, the other side goes a little quicker.
so if the first, i took two three minutes, maybe the second side takes a minute to two minutes.
but you 'll know, you know, in pancakes are cooked were, all born with that ability.
it 's in our DNA.
i 'm going to transfer those to a warm plate, nothing says, i do n't really love you that much like serving food on ice cold plates.
so , do n't do that especially for breakfast?
i 'm going to spread a little bit of butter on top optional, optional, i mean, please do it, it 's not pancakes and.
let 's get a little melted butter on there Q gratuitous maple syrup seen sorry ca n't find my sexy music sound clip.
but anyway you can hum that part to yourself and there we go good old fashioned pancakes how amazingly simple this is the classic recipe, not too thick not too thin tender delicious just amazing.
so i really hope you give these a try this was a very popular food wish all the ingredients are on food wishes dot com and as always enjoy.
