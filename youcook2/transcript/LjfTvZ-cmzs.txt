but i have a little bit of cooked potato, let me see, i 've gotta start off with these lovely red rooster potatoes, which i 'm going to him and great.
this is of course, greater cheese right there.
and then that goes like.
so right now that potato is grated i 'm going to rinse off the starch.
but you 've got to.
now squeeze as much of the water out as you possibly can do this over the sink.
if you want that 's as much water.
as i 'm going to get out of that in that colors back in there.
now this is where my mother and i differ.
this is could protect over, and i 'm going to add this fixing raw and crawl i cook potato together i 'm going to add.
