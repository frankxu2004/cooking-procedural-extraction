one of the things i learned from one of my favorite aunts, and virginia is how to make sauerkraut.
she makes the best and it 's so easy to make and with so few ingredients.
some sugar vinegar water salt, and of course, cabbage and what you want to start out with or some nice cabbage heads about this size and all i 'm doing is i 'm sharing are chopping the cabbage up to really sort of slow like consistency.
pack it in jars like this, so i 'm taking these quart jars.
and i 'm just putting the cabbage in there, you know, we grow a lot of cabbage here at the farm.
it 's a beautiful cool weather season plant.
we grow different varieties.
because they come off at different times in the cabbage, heads are of different sizes.
but when i like to grow for ornamental purposes is red cabbage now.
what i 'm doing here is i 'm packing the cabbage down in the jars.
you want to pack it in just as much as you can as you can see, i 've got it just about packed in.
i think i can add a little more there.
what you do n't want is the cabbage to touch the top of a jar lid.
so i 'm just getting it down to about that point just about got it all packed down in there.
look at that in that beautiful.
OK , so i 've got four quarts already started and what you need to think about here is.
it takes about one head of cabbage to do three quarts, just think about that and what you do now is really.
add three basic ingredients and it 's just one teaspoon per ingredient, so you want one teaspoon of sugar in each one of these.
can you set it right on the top just like that, and then you want one teaspoon of salt?
this is canning salt little courser.
and then one teaspoon of vinegar that puts the sour in sauerkraut that was a little shot there we go alright that vinegar smells good.
now what i 'm going to do is just fill it ladle boiling water into each one of the jars.
i 'm just going to fill it up.
just to the neck, you can see that hot water is caring the sugar and the vinegar and the salt all the way down just there.
we go again, just right up to the neck.
so we 've got the water in there.
crowd is already cooking, and now it 's just a matter of taking placing the lids on all of these quart jars just like this.
you want to tighten them down.
we look at that in that beautiful.
now this is where the art of canning comes in my aunt.
ginny is finished at this point, she just stores her cabbage or now sauerkraut in a cool, dark place and just let 's it sit there.
and it 's ready to eat in about a month.
now you can also drop it in a hot water bath.
and i 've done that here you can put it in boiling water for about twenty minutes, and lifted out.
and then stored in a cool, dark place, either way you want to make sure that the lids pop you 'll hear them when it sealed and if you get any discoloration at all those, you should never eat.
but this is a really easy sauerkraut recipe and was.
so wonderful about this.
it 's delicious, cooked with pork also with apples.
it 's a wonderful addition to the pantry for those fall and winter meals.
