did i go as in welcome today on making one of my all time favourites?
i eat far too much of this.
it is that good, and it 's very easy to make at home, so for starters, i 've gotta hot walk.
i 'm adding a bit of oil and straining with the seafood.
i 'm using some forms, some muscles, and some scallops, scallops are n't common in alexa, but i like them.
so i 'm going to use them, you can also opt for chicken instead of seafood this step will take a couple of minutes.
and , once that seafoods corp just remove it from the walk and here.
i 've got some shot down in partly brown this and now i 'm adding some lexa paste.
this is available in the asian section of your supermarket, and i 'm using a couple of tablespoons as a case of personal taste.
here adjust to how strong you want the flavor in your soup, and i 'm just going to cook this for about a minute or so, until it becomes nice and aromatic and.
now to add some coconut milk.
i 've got a four hundred milk hand of coconut milk here.
now you can use the whole thing, but i 'm going to use half of it and make up the other half with some water.
i 'm also using light coconut milk and what this does is.
it just makes it a little bit healthier.
you want the full flavor punch, use the full fat coconut milk and use the whole can.
so , once that comes to the syma, i 'm adding in some vegetables.
i 've got some julienne carrots also got a bit of broccoli, of course, it 's your choice of vegetables.
i 'm also going to add some deep fried tofu.
i 've made a video on how to make this at home, so you can check that out.
if you like i 'll put a link down below in the description bar and the soup party is done.
it 's time to put this together, so into a bowl or, measuring some hokkien noodles.
i 've also got some thin rice noodles here so you can use your choice of noodles now.
it 's time to add that, say food on top followed by the tofu and broccoli, and then i 'm just going to label the rest of that soup over the top beautiful stuff guys and to top it off.
i 'm just going to sprinkle over some chopped spring onions as well as some fried shallots.
