today , i 'm going to show you how to make one of my favorite tacos, tacos de langre, which actually translates to beef tongue.
so i have all my meezan, plus here.
i 've onions garlic little bit of oil step over here.
get that going and going to sweat them to bring out the flavor i 'd love that sounds so good on low here.
and then i have some jalapenos with the seeds in veins.
removed , take a little bit of the heat away.
so i 'm going to add that right.
if you use jalapenos wear gloves guys because the oil will irritate your skin.
and if you touch your eyes, you 're going to hate yourself.
and then i have a little mint upfront there which will also add a nice flavor for the braising liquid alright.
so that is sweating smells delicious alright.
i have some stock here.
some aromatics showing to add.
next and so i just want to talk about this really quickly well, this is sweating.
so beef, tongue is a muscle, and it is very firm.
and it requires a long time to cook.
so give yourself at least two and a half hours.
the front is very lean.
the back is more fatty and the fat is what makes this thing amazing.
so , if you ask me this is my favorite piece.
but we 're going to chop it up and mix it together, so it 's a little more even in uniform, so, i think we 're perfect here.
knife color just going to add the aero, matics.
add the mint.
stir it up a little bit.
and some water here you want to submerge it.
you can also roast the tongue entirely up to you.
i 'm just a fan of braising.
because you can let them eat stay in the liquid and it will make it a little easier to preserve it will allow it to keep a little more flavor and, pudding in vinegar.
now as a nice acidity to it.
lastly , i 'm going to put some stock on the huge fan of stock.
it just adds a nice base flavor.
if you want to be neutral, you can use vegetable stock, which is what i do a lot you could use chicken.
if you want if you 're going to use, i would use it just to cook beef so we have vegetables here with this.
you do n't really need to do anything to it to prep when it 's done cooking, you 're going to be able to appeal this.
really course, these are like the taste bugs, be able to peel that right off that 's how you 'll know.
it 's done so now i 'm going to take the tongue.
i 'm going to put it in the braising pot here.
and i would say you do n't necessarily need to submerge the whole thing here 'cause you 're going to top on it, and it 's going to keep the heat going all around.
but that liquid is going to reduce overtime, and you 're going to have an amazing little slash sauce that you can label over it in about two and a half, hours later.
we 're just going to take a little knife and see if we can easily cut a piece off see if it 's ready alright.
so we 've been patiently waiting for the language to braise were at about three hours.
now you should really just feel inside.
you want the meat to just pull off.
so tender so we 're going to do now take this beautiful beef.
tongue put it down watch out.
it 's really hot.
you can use your knife to help you, see i just peels right off, so beautiful.
that 's how you know, it 's done too, so we 're just going to.
i 'm going to hold off doing it all.
but i 'm instead going to cut my favorite part of the tongue, which is the bottom part right down underneath.
because it has higher fat content.
and it is so delicious.
we are it 's right here.
you can see the beautiful layers of fat in the middle, that is, what 's going to make your taco.
chop it up going to save a little bit of the broth here to soak the meeting.
because once you cut this up, you 're going to be exposing a lot of the meat to the flavor here.
whereas before it was right in the center of the tongue now, you have opportunity to really just absorb all that fits my.
god is so good.
so tortilla pan heating right, behind me.
yes , right here awesome, we 're going to go simple here.
we want to highlight the flavor of the beef.
we have tomato salsa, fresh avocados, lime.
everything is very mild.
it 's going to show off how awesome are.
beef is so i 'm just going to check this wo n't add a little color.
and then we 're ready to build this baby and guys once you taste this, you wo n't even think twice that have done right there.
we go tongues is amazing siamois that is, that 's why i like to braise instead of roast.
see you still have some of the jalapenos and onions in here beautiful alright text.
and if you want to spice it up a little bit we have some hot sauce time all right, right there, that is a taco.
