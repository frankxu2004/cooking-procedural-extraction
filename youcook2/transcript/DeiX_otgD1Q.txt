which is called canon, which is a classical irish dish basically what we 're trying to do is to make this mashed potato with these days, raises you want to get as much moisture out of the potato as possible.
so rock falls in that rate, you can buy this quite cheap.
so we placed them on the salt and another good tip is if you spike your potatoes, it 's going to release the steam.
so it 's going to dry out your potato.
so it 's a little bit more fluffy.
so , these potatoes we 're going to put in the oven, as high as it will go.
so are potatoes have been in for just over an hour with this check, no resistance there, your potatoes.
and that 's where you get that wallpaper paste.
gluey sort of mash.
so we 're going to do two methods of mash.
we 've got the old school, more measure.
and you 've got the rice.
are so grab, three potatoes, each, we 're going to do is cut it in half?
and you 're just going to a potato scoop, it.
out this passage in.
kenya , i 'm trying get as much out as well.
a kid on the way say what you need to do now.
is you need to match this?
this is what the writer gives you when you compound it together.
it 's really smooth whereas his a little bit more chunky for at home, that 's fine.
this was just to show you two different types so we can mix it together 'cause we 're not here to waste anymore.
we 're going to get a potato.
what so what i 'm going to get you to do is spoon in water spoon in as much as it will take you 'll see it start to split, and what, you do, is you keep moving around?
so keep going, keep going like it looks a lot of water.
but you 're not going to eat the whole pan to yourself, this will do a lot of people that was approximately two hundred grams of butter data weighed split.
it shiny, the border stand.
it was held a little bit, we 're going to just add it about four hundred mills of milk, which is warm.
and then you can work that.
so what you want to do is just incorporated seaways getting cream.
today , if you want to grab this salt and pepper just give it a little, little bit of salt and the other thing about potatoes.
is a base you can flavor this ten other dishes?
so you 're starting with just potato, but it takes on the other flavors.
so that 's a match made traditionally called users cabbage in ireland because it there 's an abundance of cabbages and onions.
but we 're just going to take it a little step for this beautiful calvin area around at the moment, which is part of the same family anyway.
we 're going to put it in wrong, and it 's going to cook in the actual steam set up at home, you should n't be sweating all the stations are one pop wonder.
next time you 're going to add your spring onions and seed away is drawing out a little bit.
you do n't panic just little tired more milk.
you want to work about to get your parsley in there.
next right, that 's it look working eight now i 'm only going to do.
then it 's just finished a dish, which just makes a little bit more special, is you 've got some more spring on in small parsley at the end, and then you 're going to just enrich it a little bit more the olive oil, and then you just say, i believe that.
so alright guys taste and tell me what you think looks delicious fuck.
rich the fresh herbs in spring on top really like sort of, you do n't notice how reaching agreement hopefully.
yeah , sort of breaks it open a little explosion such a beautiful texture dish out of a simple potato dish you 've created a rockstar dish, you do n't have to be complicated.
just understands flavors and ingredients your work of it.
and then you can come up with a great dish.
hopefully , you 'll use it for the competition.
