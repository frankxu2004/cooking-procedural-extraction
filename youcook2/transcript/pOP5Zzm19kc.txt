hello , this is chef john from food wishes.
dot com with pork fried keenwah that 's right.
this is our first cymon recipe.
thank you for noticing.
and while i do enjoy the flavor of keen wah i 'm certainly not above covering it up with fried ham peppers and onions.
so let me show you this super easy and very nutritious, keenwah recipe idea.
so we 're going to start by rinsing some keen wah.
often cold running water.
some of these packages will say prewash, but do n't believe the hype.
why should anyway just in case under cold water for about a minute we 're going to let that drain really, well, we 're going to dump it in a saucepan alright and the amounts here are critical?
so make sure you go to food wishes.
dot com to get all the accurate ingredient amounts.
so we 're going to dump that in a saucepan we 're going to add cold water and a pinch assaults.
we 're going to put that on high heat.
we 're going to bring it to a simmer and as soon as it starts to simmer.
i 'm going to give it a stir.
i 'm going to quickly cover it.
we 're going to reduce the flame down to low, and we 're simply going to simmer slowly minutes and after fifteen minutes, we 're simply going to turn off the heat and let it sit there covered for another five minutes, and then it 's ready to fluff and add to the rest of the ingredients, which is what we 're going to be prepping.
while the keen wah cooks, so we 're going to go ahead and dice up some smoked ham.
you can see.
i 've already messed up some garlic cut up some red pepper, cut up some green onions mostly the white parts going to save some of the green tops for the end, as usual, and.
because keen was such a small little grain by the way, it 's not a great, it 's a seed.
but anyway because it 's such a small seed furnished to be too big.
so nice small dice on this stuff is going to work perfectly, and once that 's prep, we 're going to take a big old frying pan or going to place it on medium heat, and then there going to put just a little bit of vegetable oil.
maybe a tablespoon going to keep this much, much, much lighter than a traditional pork fried rice.
we 're going to jump in the ham the peppers and the onions and we 're going to cook that stirring for about.
i do n't know five minutes or so.
we definitely want to keep some texture in the onions and peppers.
but we do want the edges of the ham to kind of karma lies a little bit that we sweetens it up beautiful smokey flavor, you 'll also notice would be a little bit of a fonda building up on the bottom of the pan that 's actually going to get the glazed off by the moisture from the keen wah.
so stay tuned for that, and once are ham is cooked, we have one last step.
we 're going to throw in the mince garlic.
we 're going to turn off the heat, and we 're just going to turn that around, i do n't want garlic to brown, and there 's plenty of heat in the pan and it 's also going to continue to cook when we put in the keen wah.
so that 's why i 'm turning off the heat.
at this point by the way, you can do this part ahead of time and just continue on when you 're keen was cooked simultaneously.
so at this point my, keen wah was done.
it 's at for five minutes, i remove the lid and we 're going to fluff it up a little bit.
look at that, so pretty all the moisture is absorbed.
but it 's certainly not dry those who sees will be tender, but not mushy.
they 're still going to have a little bit of a bite to them.
so that 's perfect.
i 'm going to go ahead and dump that into the frying pan.
we could put our heat back on medium low.
and we 're going to take a spoon or spatula and just stir that in to the ham, onion pepper mixture.
and you remember what i said about that a little bit of carmelization at the bottom of the pan, do moisture on the keen wah?
it 's going to absorb all that flavor and color.
so i 'm just going to turn that around for about two minutes, and then to finish we 're going to season this with a little bit of seasoned rice vinegar, a little splashes soy sauce.
and then, of course, i need a little heat mine.
i 'm going to use a little charata.
hot sauce, anything spicy would be delicious.
if you went through an egg in here like regular fried rice.
go ahead, but i do n't think it works as well with keen allows it does with rice, so i 'm gonna put the egg but feel free.
in fact next time i might try topping this with a poached day which i think would be and of course.
the green onion tops turd that in and when i say this is easy i 'm not kidding, as soon as you mix in those ingredients, and it 's all heated through your ready to eat.
this is so incredibly fast and simple.
this is like the dream weeknight dinner, especially if you 're doing this with leftover, keenwah, orquin, why you cooked ahead of time this whole dinner is going to take about fifteen twenty minutes to do so.
let 's go ahead and put that up.
i 'm going to finish with some toasted sesame E seeds for me.
sesame E oil, a little too strong in this, but i do like that subtle nutty note.
so , i want to put a few those on and there you go.
pork , fried, keen wah, and we all know how nutritious and awesome keen.
why is it 's a super food as they say, but, you know, what who cares about super foods, if they do n't taste good and with this here that 's not a problem this really is.
so tasty, and delicious, you will not be thinking for a second, you 're eating healthy, we have no problem with cooking healthy as long as it looks like this, and it does n't taste healthy, then, everybody wins?
so i really hope you give this a try head over to food wishes, dot com for green amounts and more info as usual, and as ellies enjoy.
