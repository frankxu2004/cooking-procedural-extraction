alright everyone we are back and let me show you what we 're going to cook for you next, and this really, i think is going to be my favorite.
because you use pork this is a wiener, schnitzel alright i love it we 're going to learn how to do that right now, and the potatoes probably the best thing ever roasted, roasted potatoes with onions and bacon and just salt, and pepper, you know, when the chef says that, that you 've got to do this recipe.
so she was going to do it, it 's easy right absolutely OK how do we start.
now what i use fingerling potatoes this one are quick roughly i do n't know i think like and it also, OK, boiled it just boil , boil.
it , with the skin, and then you peel off the skin, no skin on your particular never skin on german roast potatoes.
never , never OK.
anyway , so that 's what i did already, and then you cut them license in.
and it was a quarter inch yet perfectly alright now.
we did that.
we cut some onions and julian alright.
i know, laura did that already.
so , of course, she told me, she really wanted to do it again.
when i said, no do n't we have enough.
we have plenty of onions.
we got something and just cut a nice little stripes.
you can also cut it in little cubes.
so that 's a whole preparation.
so what we start out pep in we have a nice hot penny and put a little oil in it, laura.
he 's going to make me do this one, but i love potato, so this is going to be easy.
tell me how much oil a little less than a quarter inch.
no , no more that 's actually perfect.
now we 're going to start with the potatoes, the potatoes already cut i was grabbing for the onions.
that 's what i saw the order, the order is the way we started potatoes first because the potatoes takes the longest to get nice and crispy and cook.
we 're going to let it cook just for a little bit.
now , well, let that cook, but we gotta, get to the pork.
let 's try that we gonna start to make the wienerschnitzel now.
i have like a whole pork loin here already cleaned up, when you go to your butcher, you can get them already cut in three or four hours pieces and what i did you plan it out.
i pounded two pieces out already, but i want you to pound one because that 's the fun part.
i like that.
what we 're going to use is we 're going to use a zip lock bag.
open it up, and now so, with that, and then you 're going to pound it.
we want to give it a nice whack.
i think they like i 'm beating that hit it, hit it, laura.
OK , let me see.
we can feel it now.
wonderful reading is starts out with salt, and pepper, pepper, pepper.
OK , this is fun.
and now the first thing we 're going to what do you think when we do braiding.
we got three ingredient.
what do we start with you?
dry wet drive, yes, one piece and the flower just made lightly.
turn it around turn around.
she shake it off again with little more check it out a little more good and now we 're going to put it in the, and both sides flights.
good , wonderful now grab some crumbs, put them on top a lot, of it and now what works really well, through the bread crumbs stick on it.
you 're going to use their fists, and you 're going to just press it down just like that stuff.
go how 's that.
let 's put that right here.
and now we 're moving then we 're ready.
let 's come over here.
let 's put some bacon in there about that.
perfect , perfect and then it is going to make this an overnight at the indian tech only want to be all the way again.
and that is going to make them up, and.
now we 're going to let that cook a little bit like medium heat not too hot.
because you 're going to burn the potatoes like i did.
and i love and burn actually just nice and crispy and diagrams like that to finish in one piece remember all the recipes are on our website bring it home dot com, there we go.
how 's that wonderful perfect, very nice now, both the potatoes, almost done.
so we 're going to add now.
