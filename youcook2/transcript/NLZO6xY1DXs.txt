in this video, i 'm going to show you how to make california roll to make the filling.
we 're going to need is some crabs musca pony.
some mail and some are mad frank.
nor now this is optional.
it 's not really necessary, but it does give that little extra touch.
now i do n't know where you get this, this is from adult shop that here locally so i 'll try to find it on the internet.
if i do i 'll put it on my store.
it makes you still work.
i do n't promise anything start off by cutting the crab sticks up not defining chopped up, which cooking up into a bowl OK.
we had a spoon of mass capone cheese, which is basically italian cream cheese, not very necessary, to put much and about a spoon of mayonnaise just do it with the eye.
now you had a couple of shakes with camorra and mix it where the fuck.
first you start by wetting your hands.
and then spreading out at one hundred and fifty grams of cooked sushi base over half sheet of nori.
i do n't much to rice down.
do n't press it down too hard?
just fluff it out slightly OK, then, we add some season seeds over it.
and now we just place it upside down onto rolling mat inside a plastic bag now.
what you want to do is you want to add the crab filling, which we made earlier OK cow.
and now we 're ready to roll you, bring it over and then keeping all the contents inside you curl it in.
so you could in applying pressure and closing it, leaving a little live at the bottom now.
you just bring it over and then compress again.
so it closes the lip and i will just do that again.
just get the right formation, and he rolled, rolled out just one more time, just kidding right shape.
alex now right.
now what you can do is you can press the edges in, well, i like to cut mine off just to mega nita.
now to get a clean cut.
i would suggest adding some cling film at least for the inside out rolls.
and you just touch the cling film to it, and i will take your sharpest knife.
you have dip it in some water.
so the rice and stick to it, ah suggest cut off OK and this, and then we cut in half, having it again, again, and what times OK share.
the rollback up bing film off discard nolen pieces that cut off embala one california roll eight pieces.
