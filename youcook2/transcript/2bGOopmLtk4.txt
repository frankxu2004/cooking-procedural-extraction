hi , i 'm maranda valentine, editor of the lifestyle blog everything, sounds better in french.
and today i 'm going to show you how to make basic mashed potatoes.
now this simple side dishes, such a classic in such a favorite, and as you 'll see really, really easy to do.
so i have all of our ingredients laid out here we 're starting with one and a half pounds of baking potatoes such as russet or yukon gold and they have been washed peeled and quartered i have them right here we 're going to use three to five tablespoons of milk i 've used five just 'cause i like my messages to be nice and creamy, also have two tablespoons of unsalted butter we have a half of a teaspoon of salt and then just a little pinch of pepper that we 're going to use over here to taste.
so i 've got water in this medium sauce pan over here.
and it 's already started to heat.
i 'm going to add my potatoes right now, and then i 'm going to bring them to a boil.
and we 're going to let this boil covered for about twenty to twenty five minutes until our potatoes are nice and tender, an ready to mash.
also , add are salt and now, we 're going to salt the water pop.
this on and now we 're going to let it boil for twenty to twenty five minutes and will check it.
you can always do the fork tests in sort of work to see if it 's tender if it is, you know, you 're ready to go.
it 's been twenty minutes and our potatoes are nice and soft.
so i 've drained them and put them into this bowl because i 'm going to mix everything together, so i 'm using a potato masher today.
but you could also use a hand mixer.
i would caution against ever.
put it in a blender or food processor or even using your hand mixer to high potatoes are.
so high in starch that they can actually become like, really quickly.
you can over process a potato.
so just keep that in mind, so when you 're working with a small amount like this i find that a potato masher looks just fine.
so we 're just going to start and just kind of break it up a little bit of mash, mash, mash does n't have to be perfect, yet we 're just starting, starting the matching process.
and now we 're going to add in the butter.
so let 's popper butter in fear and you 'll definitely want to make sure that you 're doing this, you know, right after the potatoes have been drained.
because you know, obviously the heat and steam from the potatoes are what is going to melt or butter here, and.
now it 's time to add in a little bit.
more salt and pepper this is to taste.
you remember that we boiled are potatoes using the salted water, and so now.
this is just a taste.
i happen to like my mashed potatoes with quite a bit of salt.
but that 's different for everyone.
so you just do however, much you like just remember that you could always add more.
but you ca n't take any apps.
maybe do n't be too heavy handed.
if you 're not sure this is yet and just mix, mix, mix.
so it 's starting to get nice and light and fluffy.
so we can add in the milk.
now a note about milk want to make sure that you use not cold milk.
if you can use at least room temperature, or warms milk, that 's better if you use cold milk.
it will react with the starch and also give you kind of gluey difficult texture.
i 've learned that the hard way along time ago, so definitely want to use some warm milk or room temperature.
if you can, it 's just a little trick to make it a bit easier.
for you, so we 're just going to add it in, in section.
so i 'm just going to kind of half right now just drizzle and mash it up.
and then the remaining little bit, and once you have this recipe down, you 'll be able to customize it to your heart 's content.
you could add in pesto, you could do roasted.
you could even add salsa into mashed potatoes.
there are so many things, but once you have this recipe down, you are good to go there, you go creamy.
delicious , the perfect quintessential side dish that 's how you make basic mashed potatoes.
