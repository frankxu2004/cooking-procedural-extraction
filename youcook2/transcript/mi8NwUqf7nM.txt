also watch the video about how to breakdown the whole fish for more in detail.
the majority of the nigger recipes requires slices of fish, which are about three inch long one inch wide, and quarter inch thick.
but judge yourself when it comes to how thick you want to cut for example, if the fish is chewy, sinner slice will be better if it 's very tender curry thicker to take the advantage of the texture of the material, all of fish has the grain within its meat when you slice off.
basically , you need to cut against the grain if you cut with the grain.
the whole long grain with stays in a piece of slides fish, which makes it chewy, especially if it 's hard, senior, like in tuna.
i try to cut across the grain so that the short pieces of tissue is connected to the grain which makes it, nicer texture.
the exception can be said only for the fish with software and fragile flesh.
if you cut against the grain them it can be easily broken apart.
so in that case cut with the grain to help that issue, keep firmly attached when you slice off the block with the opposite direction of grain he will be hard to cut if you change the direction of your night.

they will make the peace longer.
the width and the thickness of the trims block, and not always, even all the way to the end.
so you need to continually adjust the angles as you work make the initial cut using the full length of the blade from the heel to the tip.
in one motion once the knife almost reached the skin side stand up the blade to cut straight down this motion creates the deeper cutting edge, which looks nicer.
the more you practice the more evenly.
you will be able to cut off each slice of peace.
