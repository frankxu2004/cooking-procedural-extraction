graph do not want this is kevin gianni.
here , am raging?
and today is wednesday we were in the kitchen.
we are and we 're going to making a super for you today.
right alright, check it out, we are making a highly mineralized soup.
this recipe is donated from frank giglio, some very excited right.
an awesome chef, so we 're starting off with that, it 's a TI.
actually hybridity of metal leaves, these little guys just tried nowadays.
i got, i got him at the, at the local health food shop.
we did n't have any living around you could use fresh ones as well.
you can totally use fresh ones, but i do n't know how well, they grow here in florida.
i do n't know danny you, in about four cups.
let me go.
that 's a little less, that 's OK, so four cups of the T and then you want to add in some kelp, kelp is really, really nutritious.
it 's got ton of minerals.
it 's from the sea so it 's got loads of minerals.
i 'm actually going to cut it up before i put in the blender iodine.
being so for you want to let it soak until it, until it 's.
GUI , so, maybe thirty minutes, i 'm just going to rough chop, it, it 's not going to completely blend up in the blender even in the vita mix, even if i remember adding every once awhile adults are kelp, inara, smoothies in there.
you always get seaweed pieces.
no matter what you can in that case, if you do n't want to see with pieces you can always get kelp in little granules.
easy enough then i 'm going to throw in some.
me , so this is just brown rice.
me so thrown a chunk of garlic and then a chunk of ginger, so you get in minerals.
you 're getting minimum seaweed, you getting silica from the nettles.
so this is really, really helpful for keeping your health, your body alkaline.
what do you got here?
this is the plum paste, a little salty and so is the meso.
so you 're not going to add any extra salt to this, this is frank some curry powder.
throw that in there, if you do n't have frank spices or do n't have them available.
you can just get a regular curry powder from your store.
or you can make your own get some curry leaves and blended up with coriander and cumin and let you get me stuff grow.
in some carrots and a little sweetness to it.
and i 've had brazil, not soaking.
i 've actually had these soaking for about an hour.
so i 'm actually going to win some before we in there christoph and throw them in that 's going to make it a little bit creamy.
we 're going to blend this.
i 'm going to spice it up with a little bit of cayenne.
you do n't have to.
but voice i like this place.
you can also add frankie, suggest to add coconut oil, and you can add definitely add coconut oil to it.
and it will help picking it up and kind of make it a little bit more creamy.
but i had it before like this, and it taste, it taste nice like this, as well, so now i need a boat.
so here we have a nice mineralized, meso soup smells good really good.
you can garnish it with some parsley, have some parsley over here?
you can even throw on some, some green onions or something.
alright looks great.
your question of the day is this.
do you guys like curry powder yes or no do you like curry insert whatever you like it skipping?
