OK , one of the things they need to kind of make early in the process as i need to make a chili oil it 's pretty simple.
i 'm going to take and put this burner on low, and here i have a quarter cup of oil from using peanut oil.
i 've got twenty red chili peppers and all i 'm doing.
i 'm just cut him in half.
i want to be able to see them, you could cut him in smaller pieces.
but they 're going to flavor the oil and spice up the oil pretty easy process.
i mean, like i said, we 're going to have this on low, and we 're just going to cook these for a little bit.
are oils been cooking ten minutes now?
this occasionally stir in the peppers.
i 'm going to call it good.
we 're just going to sit this aside and let it wait for us until we 're ready for it.
so let 's do it.
rundown smoothbore other ingredients in here in the mortar and pistol.
i took two tablespoons of sichuan peppercorn sometimes.
those are also called prickly ash, and i ground them up.
now it takes a little bit of work so you may want to do it in a coffee grinder.
anyway , i have here some spicy bean paste.
you want to make sure you get something that has the bean paste in it because this also add salt to the dish without that.
if you just use the spicy stuff you would have to use some post office or something to bring salt to the dish.
i 'm not going to use any soy sauce today.
i 've got a quarter cup of green onion that i 've diced up or chopped up four ounces of ground pork.
two tablespoons of ginger that 's been roughly chopped and two tablespoons of garlic that 's been roughly chopped.
so here i have a block of silken tofu.
i 'm just going to kind of roughly chop this up.
you want a nice big pieces.
'cause some of the corners and stuff are, are going to come across or fall off of it?
i did forget to mention that i made a cornstarch slurry.
i have one teaspoon of cornstarch in one tablespoon of chicken stock, and i also have three quarters cup of chicken stock now in my pan here.
it 's warming up on the varner.
we 're not going to be screaming hot.
i 'm going to put about three tablespoons of oil, yeah.
but it will in this dish.
but it is good.
so we 're going to look past that some oil is getting warm, it 's not hot and that 's fine.
going to we 're going to put our garlic in our ginger in, here and then we 're going to start putting some of this.
sichuan peppercorn in here.
wanna put about two thirds of this, in here.
there we go back to work set that aside used some of that for garnish later.
now we 're going to do.
do n't worry other stuff coming pretty soon alright?
so we 're about three minutes in my garlic and ginger is starting to soften up a little bit.
and we 're going to turn this heat up a little bit.
we 're still not going to crank it up.
OK , now it 's time for pork, which will break this up alright.
so are pork is basically cooked.
it 's not crisping up or anything like that yet, but it 's cooked all the way through.
broke it up, and, garlic and ginger is really doing good.
now we 're going to put our spicy bean paste in here, and you 're about to see some magic starting now.
now that stuff is salty, so, if you do n't like real salty, you might want to use just a little bit of it.
and then use some just plain spicy chili paste and give this.
we 're going to go ahead and turn the heat up a little bit more.
give this a couple minutes OK.
now if you do n't want it.
so salty you can use some of this, and it 'll help you with spice and everything.
and it 's not so salty.
now this is basically ready for our chicken stock quit.
injected heat up a little bit.
now we 've got our corn starch and chicken stock, going to put this in i 'm going to cook this for a little bit.
sure it 's this is just starting to pick it up.
we 're going to go ahead.
and we 're going to put our chili oil in, here as if it did n't have enough oil all right, this is really bubbling away.
we 're going to go ahead.
and we 're going to put our gently put our tofu in here.
remember this is silken tofu and will break apart really easy.
we want a little bit to break apart, that is, what does the final thickening on the sauce.
but we still want some big pieces in there now, we 're going to gently stir this around, make sure all sides of this tofu absorbs all these good flavors, and we 've worked to put in here going to give us about another minute, and it will put our green onions in there alright i 'm going to take all most of these green onions and put 'em in there i 'm going to leave a little bit for garnishing OK i wanna take and put some of this in our bowl.
here make sure we show some peppers on here.
put some green onion.
does some of this szechuan, peppercorn on there.
and , that is dinner.
