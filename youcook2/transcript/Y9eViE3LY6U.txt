time to make one of my all time favorite lunches.
it 's fresh and delicious and everyone loves it.
let 's make some caesar salad on the one pot chef first things.
first , i 'm just making a boiled egg now.
you see me make boiled eggs before in the past.
but basically, we 're just going to boil egg for about six to seven minutes until it 's hard, boiled let it cool off PM off the shell and then dice it up into little pieces also cooking up some like, and i 'm just using some short triangle spoken which i 've just chopped up.
we 're just going to fry this up until it 's nice and crispy next.
i 'm making some croutons now.
traditionally , croutons are little cubes of bread, which would do fraud.
i 'm doing a slight variation on this 'cause.
i do n't like to deep fry bread.
i find it really greasy and oily.
so i 'm just going to bake them.
i 'm going to spray them with a little bit of cooking spray, then play some into another hundred and eighty degrees.
celsius for about five to ten minutes or until they 're nice and golden toasted, then will be ready to move on croutons are looking goldman gorgeous, so.
let 's just leave those aside, for the moment while we work on our salad, dressing to make a caesar salad dressing first.
we 've got half a cup of whole egg mayonnaise and two that automatically in one teaspoon of crushed garlic about one clove on cheating and using the stuff out of job do n't judge me.
i 'm also adding into anchovy, fillets, which i 've just chopped up nicely.
now you do n't have to put the anchovies.
it is kind of what gives this the traditional caesar salad flavors, so try to use it.
do n't be put off by the air service, and i 'm also adding in two tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice, and just mix that all up to combine?
i think we 're about ready to combine everything together and make a caesar salad in my big salad bowl.
i 've got one large cause letters, which i just roughly torner, please let this serves about four or five people.
so this is just one serving.
so into that.
i 'm going to add in our croutons bacon diced, boiled egg a little bit of shaved parmesan shades just over the top and last.
but not least we just go to drizzle over the dressing and that sack absolutely gorgeous smelling the taste is going to be fantastic.
