hi guys, and learn, but alley on this opposite of water in the kitchen i 'm going to show you how many step perfect hum.
it 's going to be creamy pussy full of flavored with garlic, and parsley, tahini, it is gonna be perfect it 's great for any occasion.
any cocktail party the super bowl, is right around the corner?
it 's the perfect thing that you can serve with either pita chips.
some cucumbers and carrots, and bag it.
you name it is perfect, so let 's do it OK.
so first thing to do is gobert ingredients ending gradients or super simple and easy, you need some chick peas are just canned.
chickpeas drained and rinsed you need some lemon parsley.
some fresh garlic, some tahini paste salt pepper and olive oil extra virgin.
olive oil now going to do this in a food processor so it 's going to be little split super simple and easy.
i 'm going to put my chick peas in here along with my garlic and parsley squeeze of lemon balm, a whole lemon, who are nice amount of saying.
so it 's not sort of overpowering, creamy and rich, the lemon really adds.
a really good freshness and bright.
note , to this, just squeeze the whole thing in there and just a little bit up tahini paste.
not tahini paste is a paste made out of sesame E, seeds and very traditional in hummus.
so we have to put that in there.
we can find it at any supermarket.
but if you ca n't find it, you do n't want to put it in there.
just leave it out.
it 's still going to be a fantastic dip.
either way, but to me is just like one of the well, it 's one of the main greens in traditional hummus.
so i 'm putting some in some salt, and pepper, and i 'm not going to put any hour.
yet i 'm going to post this and get it like a nice sort of chunky, and then we 're going to drizzle in the olive oil through the feeding tube consistency is looking pretty good, nice and chunky just going to put the lid back on and now, i 'm going to start drizzling any alvoid that looks fantastic.
the texture is wonderful.
if you want a bit more chunky by all means leave it a bit more chunky.
i like it.
nice and smooth like that when you can serve this with pita chips, you can serve this with.
and i screwed it a platter, you know, some baby carrots and some i do n't know celery or red bell peppers is one of my favorite ways to eat this.
but my absolute favorite way is with cucumbers.
there 's just something about the fresh crisp cucumber with rich creamy texture of the hummus.
i just love it now.
traditionally , you would wanna let this sit in your fridge just for a couple of hours just for the flavors to develop it will taste much better.
but this is so good wonderful hum.
it 's quite it 's inexpensive and it 's perfect for any party.
