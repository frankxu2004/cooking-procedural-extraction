hi , i 'm very welcome.
the berries kitchen.
today , we 're making boneless hot chicken wings, and i 'm gonna put wings in quotes because this is not actually made from chicken.
wing meat is made from chicken breasts.
that 's why it 's boneless, then have the wings bones to worry about that you have normally and wings.
i do have a recipe for hot wings that uses regular wings that are chopped into two pieces, and you get the nice piece.
and also it 's marinated an.
it 's kind of roasted herb, roasted or broiled in the oven, and has always good flavors in it.
you might like that variety.
but another variety that you 'll see as an appetizer in restaurants, a lot is made totally of chicken breast meat and it 's cooked.
just like fried chicken maybe flavored up a bit and quested a bit, and then it 's dipped into a hot dipping sauce.
i think the hot wing sauce, and will be able to dip these boneless chicken wings in the hot wing sauce.
so let me show you how to get started.
i bought chick in, in the form that you see right here.
frozen , and these were chicken breast with rib meat and this is three pounds worth an.
what you 'll see here is all of that, minus one individual half wing that i put out here to show you what i 've been doing.
i had been using my kitchen shares to take cough any.
fat scrap, three.
gristle anything that really would not be good in this meal or in this appetizer, and then i took which individual piece of breasts, an I chunked it up.
so you 'll see these are in pieces like that there 's no particular shape or size summer gonna be small, like that, and some record larger like that.
so as they begin to fry which we will do in this cult will look at the ones that are getting done.
maybe they 'll get done faster when they 're smaller, but as they get done, they will come out.
and they will be drained on paper toweling, and they will be ready to eat hot as they are with the hot dipping sauce.
and i was just finishing this went up just giving you an idea of how i checked those up.
it does n't have any great importance as to what you do with him.
just get them in pieces.
now i like to wash my hands and come back and continue with what we 're going to do for me right back.
so , how can i chicken?
chunked an what.
i 've been doing, well, i 've been away.
i did take some atlantic sea salt and just ground it over the tab and turn that with my hands.
i 'm just demonstrating that putting a lot on now, and some fresh peppercorns and again with my hands i work that in going to wash my hands now.
the idea is to dip our chicken into egg wash and then dip it into flour, and then we 'll come over here to a skillet that is heating right now.
it has about one half inch of peanut oil and give you an eye on that.
because we need to be ready for that, if i 'm going to do, is place some spices in with our flower?
this is one cup of flour and if we run out will just get more.
but i 'm put in one teaspoon of salt, and you might say, well, you already saw to that the thing is when it goes in the egg wash that takes a lot of the salt off and you do n't get a whole lot of salt for you, dip it in the flower.
and , put in one half teaspoon of paprika, an one half teaspoon of rosemary leaves, so i 'm just going to bring this together at the top.
not really, this, like it but shaking a bit alternatives down.
see it kind of wavering a little bit that does n't.
it 's really hot, but i 'll show you a couple of these.
you 're just going to take a couple of them at a time is about three.
put them in the egg wash and get them all nice and covered shake it up a bit.
and then bring it to your bag that has the flour and spices.
then you 're going to take that really well, and then reach in there and get one of your coated pieces.
and put it in your hot oil.
it wo n't take long for it to fry.
so what we 've got to do is get back there and get some more of these, try to get that covered in one layer.
i wo n't be able to them, all in one batch, but i 'll come back and just repeat that process.
when they 're brown on the bottom or golden, i will turn them over and let them get golden on the top by that time they will be done all the way through an.
I have a platter with a paper towel waiting over here for them.
so will be getting it done and serving him with a nice dipping stuff in a few minutes.
we finished up frying are chicken wings.
these are boneless chicken wings.
an , you know, that they 're really chunks of chicken breast and their seasoned up a bit, an fried in peanut oil and they come out nice, and crispy and they 're just perfect for combining with this hot wing dip.
so i 'm going to show you a serving over here is my paper blade.
actually plastic, but for something like this is just an appetizer, or it 's something that might be one of several things served at a party and i know a lot of you are getting ready for the super bowl, and this is just a suggestion.
i did the real hot wings last year, not super bowl time.
but it sometime during the year i did hot wings that i wanted a different version for you.
year , so you could try these if you like, but we serve them by just type your fingers.
is your finger food so i just take as many as you want or you might have other things that require.
fork , so if you have a four then it would be easy to use.
you for as far as the hot wing.
sauce , but either drizzle that over these or allow guests to dip in some people do n't like to share with others.
so i 'm just going to put some over one of them and then make a level spot there where i could do some now with this.
we like to serve celery.
it 's not some crunchy, and it 's a good contrast, and with the celery, obviously we have some blue cheese dressing.
and to go with.
that i have diit ale eight one and some of you may have gone with us to the ale, eight one bottling plant in winchester kentucky.
so i 'm going to be pouring that for my drink tonight.
next county over from where we live in kentucky.
so i hope you enjoy the boneless chicken wings, you 're probably curious to see.
what are hot wings?
look like the boneless hot wings, when we cut into one this should be nice and white that indicates that they 're done all the way through.
and here we have a peace.
and i 'm just going to take that with my.
fork , and get a bit of sauce on it and taste it for you.
spicy sauce really good.
and the chicken flavor is really good.
the crust is crunchy.
an it 's, it 's salty but not over salted at all.
and i can taste just a hint of the rosemary and paprika i think you 'll like it.
