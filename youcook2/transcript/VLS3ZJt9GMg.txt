gay walking to the simple cooking channel today.
i 'm going to show you my recipe for crumb calamari rings, right, so the club mix i use half a cup of bread.
crumbs play quarter of a cup of cold flake.
crumbs you can buy it in a packet already made.
or you can just get some conflicts.
pin crush them sealed plastic bag and a quarter of a cup parmesan cheese and just mix it all together so you get your calamari.
and you just tip it straight in the flower.
well , when i give it my calamari, first, and it 's optional, is i just let it sit in some sweet chili sauce for about half.
now just to give it a little kick and straining the constraining, the crumb mix, to sit at the silent play, just repeat that process over with all the calamari rings are ready to go.
so let 's start cooking.
so what we do is put the heat on loads of low medium and put into some butter margerine or some oil.
whatever it is that you usually use right now.
i 'm just checking the calamari young.
the calamari does n't take long to cook at all.
really just three or four minutes so basically after about two minutes or so, will turn them over for this start, turning them over like year.
those are done.
can you hadel just let them sit there for thirty seconds or so?
well , i hope you enjoyed my recipe for crumb calamari cheese virtually good.
i 'll see you next time.
the next meal.
