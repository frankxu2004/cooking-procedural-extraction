hey welcome back to another big meet, sunday.
thanks for sticking with me today.
we 're going to do something for a great friend of mine.
her youtube channel is two fifty five sage.
if you 've not heard of this lady.
go check her out.
she is full of amazing recipes, and she also does a lot of food storage and canning and vacuum sealing things like that.
so if you 're interested in that, as, well, definitely a great resource to check out, she 's having a contest.
and basically she 's asking for one of our favorite recipes.
and i struggled with this 'cause.
i like food, i do n't have any favorite, so basically we 're going to do some tacos today.
OK thanks for coming back, so we 've got order.
carne , asada steak, and we 've got onion.
some jalapeno peppers, green onions and a boatload of cilantro, cilantro.
we 're going to get our skirt steak all season, up here skirt.
steak is great for this scott, a lot of fat in it you can see these fat layers down here tons of labor.
so we 're going to throw down a little pepper some onion powder little garlic powder, and then chili powder, one of my favorite items to dress this up with.
and instead of salt i use adobo seasoning, uh, the stuff i get from my local butcher seems to be really salty.
and so kind of got an interesting chili flavor, but it 's salty too so that really works out nicely some cumin.
it 's kind of got that latin thing going on for you.
little bit of kumon and just kind of rub that in we 're going to do the same thing to the other side of this, and then we 're going to get it on the grill.
so i 'll grill it and bring it back in an will take the tacos from there.
so steaks around the grill.
also , those green onions that you saw here.
those are also out on the grill, grill, green onions, on a taco is just special.
if , you know, what i 'm saying so, yeah, special, i said that so anyway want to cut up some onion.
i like to have a little bit onion and a little bit of cilantro nice, nice chop cilantro onions.
so we 're just going to get this onion chopped, nice and small and then for the cilantro, i just usually just try to get the main leafy part.
i 'm not real picky about it.
most of it i do n't use.
i do n't mind a little bit of stems either.
but i 'll just crumple it up like this and try to keep it in that nice tight little wad and then just go through it with a knife.
i like that.
and then kind of come out at a different angle just get those stands chopped up a little and by the bing botta boom doing with that.
and we get these jalappa knows all cut up conceited.
let 's get these dice up.
and i know linda definitely likes her spicy stuff, too.
i 've seen her do.
some cooking with it missed go alright.
so there is going to be our little pile of jalapenos and go out and probably flip, flip that 's take over right now.
check on the onions and when we get back, we 're going to toast us up some tortillas and going to be real close to top of time stick around hey alright.
so we 're back, and we 're going to take care of those tortillas now.
what i typically do is not like the wrong burner on the stove.
oh , now i 've got i got one of these childproof ovens.
if you turn it on and then turn it back off, you ca n't turn it back on for like ten seconds retarded.
i do n't even have kids done, thank you OK, so we 're going to do our tortillas.
i use nice small corn tortillas.
that 's kind of my pleasure if you will right on the burner just turn it down a little bit.
also what i 'd like to do is little cheese going on.
so let this guy go for.
i do n't know until he gets a little toasty on top, but not, too to see.
and you 'll see why right when it starts to puff up like this.
that 's where i 'm going to flip it.
and i recommend using tongues, and this is kind of a mess on your stove as well, especially if you drop cheese like i just did but, yeah, you do, one side just a little bit just to get it heated then you flip it over and you 'd get it nice and toasty on the other side, where the cheese is melting and that 's where it 's at right there.
so like did cut up my meat it 's over here kind of chilling out well, actually, it 's saying warm underneath some tin foil and what i 'm going to do.
when i get about two or three of these guys, and i 'll get him played it up, will build our tacos alright.
so we are ready to build our talk of the purpose behind the cheese on the tortilla, is n't just 'cause it 's damn could basically it 's like a little wet suit for the taco.
so get some meat down in there?
and you know, i like lots of hot sauce ca n't go wrong there.
so typically i put.
so much on that, it starts leaking out and then it kind of gets at all soggy.
so you gotta, you gotta do that extra little layer little onion, so we got our meat down cheese.
some onion little salon, TRO, and maybe a little jalapeno on there i forgot my hot sauce.
oh , el yucateca.
good stuff little bit goes along way.
lou and that 's plenty, uh, that 's going to be pretty hot, so let 's try to use one of these guys out, oh, i forgot.
i kind of have a little guacamole right or avocado let 's go everybody in there, you go.
tacos huh, one of my very favorite things.
no , well, the hot sauce is good.
so this is just a perfect lunch or dinner back i did n't eat it for breakfast you do him.
anyway , you want there 's tons of different variations, you can do with them.
but most, most of all, their simple, an damn good too.
so , thanks for watching linda congratulations on all your subs, forty seven hundred last, i checked appreciate the opportunity to join your contest.
