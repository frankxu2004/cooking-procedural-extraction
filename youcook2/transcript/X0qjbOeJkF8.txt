i 'm back, spring now.
and i wanted to show you how to harvest in enjoy eating your garden snails hear anything like me.
you 've eaten snails, alot in restaurants, their family favorite around here.
and if you 're a gardener, you also find the little garden snails pretty obnoxious.
you have enough of them.
they can do some real damage to your plants show the best solution for your snails.
is two targets them beat them and enjoy them will be out of your hair and you get a really nice appetizer out of it if you 're going to harvest your snails there 's just two things you need to make sure you have in advance one?
is a bag canvas bag or paper bag to collect them in?
you want to make sure you do n't use plastic because the snails, needtobreathe and the other is a good container that also allows us here.
i 'm going to use this plastic.
i 'm gonna cover it with some breathable, washcloths there.
once i 've collected by snails.
so make sure you have both of those things before you start.
otherwise , you 're not going to have anywhere to put your snails with you, collecting the best time to look for snails.
right after a rain, we just had a little bit of a rain shower here and.
now all of the sales are coming out, you can see him there to the tops of the foliage.
they look for the moisture, so they come out into plainview and easy to find.
otherwise , they 're probably hiding under leaves, or wherever they can hide during the heat of the day.
so wait till just after a rain when it 's nice and cool, and the sales will start coming out it 's easy to harvest snails.
because they 're very, very slow.
so all you need to do to reach out and pick him off i 'm going to put this guy in my bag just like that, and then he goes look for the big snails.
your garden snails are going to be pretty small in comparison to ones are used to add a restaurant.
so you just want to look for the big ones and leave the small ones alone.
now it 's a little hard to see these guys in focus, but here 's another nice big one.
if he comes and in the back.
so after a nice spring shower, if you 're looking, through leafy green areas of your garden, which is where the snails like to hang out.
should take just a couple minutes to get an ice bag full, pretty big snail?
you can see your garden snails should have these little stripe, shelves just like that.
they 're pretty and these are the guys are looking forward to eat.
so all i 'm going to do now is take my little harvest and put it in my bed.
so we 're going to be able to put them in there and pick off anyone.
who 's trying to escape there.
we go you garden.
snails are perfectly safe TV.
each an really tasty as i said, but you do n't know what they 've been eating.
the whole time will be out in your garden.
so one important thing about harvesting snails you ca n't eat him right away.
you have to keep him for about a week and feed them a nice clean diet to be sure that they 're going to be safe.
though some of these scaping.
so what i 'd like to do is just feed them a little bit of yellow, cornmeal just like this, just pour some in there.
they do n't really need very much, you can actually just feed them nothing for a week is, well, some people do that.
but i 'd like to give him a little bit of food.
so that they stay nice and big.
so put some formula in their container with snails and then cover it up like i said earlier.
it 's very important that the snails be able to breathe.
because you need him to stay alive during this first week.
so it 's been about two days since i put my snails in their container.
and here you can see it, it actually eating all the corn meals, they 're pretty hungry, and you can see.
there 's a lot of snail poop in there as well, so that white and brown stuff that 's a good sign, means they are cleaning themselves out.
so what we need to do.
now is wash the snails off an wash out their container that 's going to get rid of the poop, and it 's also going to give him a drink.
they need water like any living creature.
so this will help them get a drink.
so what i 'm going to do is put them column, column here just like that.
you can see right now they 're all dormant.
they 're not moving and that 's perfectly normal at this stage for them to be darn.
it , but they should all wake up once i started spraying them with water.
so one of the benefit of doing this is that you 'll find any dead snails you can take out.
you do n't want any dead ones so it 's going to turn on cool water and reach them.
now you can start to see some of the snails are waking up the little feet are coming out.
that 's what the bottom snails called in the foot.
and so, for example, this guy here clearly awake is little antenna.
and he 's getting annoyed at me going to put him back in the container and as long as they are all waking up getting back in your container and seal it again, make sure once again that this nails can breathe, and then leaving for another couple days and then clean him again.
so you can see everybody is alive and active.
and you, gotta be careful at this point because you will have a lot of attempted escapees.
they really get going after you spray them down with some water.
but as long as you seen a move a little bit, or, she 's a little something coming out of every one of their feet there.
definitely alive just make sure you add some more food for them cornmeal.
or if you 're using white flour or a leaf that 's fine, too skipping a little more food and ceiling back up.
so it 's been one week and my snails have been eating their clean diet of corn meal there.
and now it is time to cook this nails everything.
we 're going to do is clean them off that we 've gotten into their own poop.
a little bit they probably touched that.
so we want a nice and clean and then pour a little bit of vinegar into roll here, and some water did not vinegar and water mix, an drop, all my snails into vinegar and water mixture, looking around the match.
show me my calendar and wake him up OK.
here i have a stock pot with enough water to cover all my snails, and i 've got it at a vigorous boil.
my snails are clean, and they 're in their calendar, and i 'm not going to talk him into the stock pot, vigorous boil, and put him in for my five minutes.
so what i 'm doing right.
now is, i 'm killing are alive up to this point.
and this will kill them and that 's one of the reasons i like to make sure.
the stock pot is at a rolling boil.
destroyed throw them in.
there , i see here, that way they go faster and i still want to torture the poor little guys.
so there they are boiling away and will give him five minutes in the stock pot.
so now i boiled my snails for five minutes in a in water and just let him cool down enough.
so you can touch him and work with the move.
it and we 're going to do now is remove this shells your garden snails are going to be pretty small in comparison to snail that you 're going to get out of.
restaurant , and so you may have seen in a restaurant S nails that are served in their shells.
one thing that 's important to realize about that is, that those snails have been taken out of their shells.
first , they 've been cooked like i 'm going to show you and put back in their shells for decoration.
it 's very difficult to do that with your garden snails because their shells are small.
so , the technique i 'm going to show you is just going to destroy the shell.
serve them out of the shells, which is another way you 'll see them sometimes.
anyway , so i 'm going to do is just crack into the show with a knife.
i happen to use chinese chefs knife.
but if you use a western chefs knife, that 's fine.
i 'm just going to give him a good crack like this sort of like an egg and the shell is going to crack apart kind of, like an egg put to remove the shell from around the sale should come off pretty UE and here.
you got a snail keep the shells away.
we 're going to reach those off later and this is the taste is now ready to go.
so here i 've got my snails with this shells removed.
now the way i showed you how to remove the shelves can sometimes leave various small bits of shell on the snails.
so you want to do is rinse them one more time and just run your fingers through them.
and your fingers will tell you if you feel anything hard or a shirt control piece of shell, and i 'm just trying to get it out of there.
but it usually comes off pretty well, with the rent.
an you should be all set now.
it 's time to actually cook the snails and that 's pretty easy to do.
i like to have my snails in beer.
but you could use a white wine as well, or just some kind of a stock.
if you like so i 'm going to put in one bottle of canadian beer here.
and , uh, about a cup and a half of water usually about a one to one proportion of beta water and then put my snails on it when heat that up bring it to a boil and then, i 'm going to simmer the snails for between one and three hours one hour for these nails should get them pretty tender.
but you really ca n't overcook it.
so if you want to just keep going that 's fine as well.
so somewhere between one and three hours simmering adjust at a boil on the stove top.
so in here i 'm going to make my garlic butter can have sealed with a nice garlic butter, uh, this is about for the dozen garden snails that i 've picked up about a quarter cup of unsalted butter.
and i put three cloves of minced garlic in my already and just going to add some nervous to it here i 've got about a teaspoon of margarine, a teaspoon of dried parsley, and i 've got a little bit of terra gone, you do n't like teragon, then do n't it salt, and pepper to taste and off you go.
so my snails in boiling for about an hour and a half, i 'm just going to scoop him up with a strainer.
put them in my butter mix.
everything together, and they are ready to go in a serving dish and to eat fails.
of course are traditionally eaten with a nice little piece of toast.
so just a pop one on there, there you go you 're going to find that these snails from your garden are very tender, have very nice flavor probably better than anything you 've had before in snails.
