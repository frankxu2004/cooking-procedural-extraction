hi cats cradle here.
i wanted to make something authentic and delicious for my family for saint patrick 's day.
so i decided to make cold cannon a lot of dishes.
we serve for saint patrick 's day, or not authentic, but this one is i 'm using potatoes that i ca n't about a year and a half ago.
and they look beautiful.
i drained the potato water off for this recipe.
but you can bet that if we were in times of scarcity, i would probably be using that potato water for something else like, to make bread.
so i 've drained them off.
and i have them in a small pan with some milk to reheat, and when they are nice and bubbly hot then i turned the element off under the pie here in another cast iron skillet.
i am heating up about a tablespoon of rendered bacon drippings, an adding about a half of ahead of slice cabbage, my pot is really hot.
i go ahead and get all of the cabbage in there.
and that 's about what this bottle hold is about a half a head of cabbage, and this was a really big head by the way, and i have my fire on really high.
because i want to fry this really quickly.
i turn it down just a little bit.
if i see any little scar tched pieces on the cabbage 'cause they do n't really want that i just want to cook very quickly, the potatoes are just about hot.
and i want the cabbage pretty well, pretty well cooked for this dish.
i 'm going to add some purple onion here.
white , is actually my choice for this distance, mixing it in mashed potatoes and sometimes purple onions will make a dish look muddy.
if you can, if you can really see them.
but they worked out.
OK , i just did n't want to slice into a new onion when i had this one that was half used in the freezer already.
so i just keep stirring it around.
what i 'm looking for is for the cabbage to be very, very wilted and for the purple onions to begin to get tender.
i just keep stirring to make sure nothing burns or scorch is on the bottom, and i 'm just going to wait now for the onions to soften up.
i 'm going to also add just a little bit of water to help it steam a little faster when their wilted when the greens are wilted like i want then, i add some salt and some fresh cracked pepper.
this is true peasant food.
this is irish peasant food, but is absolutely delicious.
and it 's one of those things that is very authentic a lot of things we eat for saint patrick 's day or not authentic.
but this is an.
so i 'm going to add some salt and pepper to the potatoes as well.
i 've changed burners brought the potatoes to the front push, the cabbage to the back because now i want to mash the potatoes.
and so i just use this handheld potato masher going all around getting all the lumps out that looks really good now, i 'm going to add just a little bit of butter and incorporate that these are things, we really love we love potatoes.
and we love cabbage and onions so they 're just perfect together in my house.
we call this comfort food.
i 'm now going to label the cabbage into the potatoes.
anne will start stirring them together in irish household that was operating under very frugal conditions, this meal.
this would have been eaten as a meal by itself if the folks would have had a little bit more money, you can see me.
i 'm sprinkling in one dice, green onion here into the hot mixture.
if they would have a little bit more money in each serving of the coal.
cannon they would have placed a poached egg right on top of it.
but in most cases, it would have been even just like this.
so now i 'm going to spoon it into my serving dish.
look how rich and beautiful that looks.
and it is as good as it looks.
it is it 's just delicious.
i 'm scraping out every little, little last bit.
and now here is one more die, screen onions sprinkled on top just for color, and this is traditional to put up at up butter right in the center.
this is a great side dish or a meal.
all by itself, i really hope you 'll give it a try.
it 's a little unusual.
we do n't usually combine these two foods together.
but you really need to try it, it 's a great way to use the bounty from your garden as well.
i hope you like this recipe until next time this is cats cradle.
