i 'm making beef burgundy.
that 's a little dressed up not complicated just with a few special touches that really have a great payoff in the flavor.
so i 've round some bacon very quickly over high heat, and i also need some drippings to brown the beef cubes in an rather than adding oil from a bottle i just decided.
let 's use bacon drippings that is.
so much more flavorful i 'm going to toss the beef cubes with some flower.
because i want to get a nice firm finish on the browned beef an once you can see that it is covered then add about half of the cubes time yes you might be tempted to speed it up and do it all at once.
but if you crowd the skillet, the beef will steam in its own juices.
because it does n't have enough individual contact with the heat of the pan, and it does n't have enough space around it to actually allow the browning to occur.
so we 've got a nice ground finish on these guides and they will be the first batch of finished beef cubes in they go.
now can batch which has been nicely patiently waiting here for them into the pan.
so we 've got the kind of brown finish on these cubes the second batch that i 've been looking for and it 's time to put them into the slow cooker as well jumped in there and, you know, what it would break my heart to leave this beautiful brown drippings behind we 're going to add some red burgundy wine and add it to this can, and you can see how it will deglaze gorgeous drippings that have collected this will add immeasurably to the flavor of the finished dish.
but before i add the wine, i 'm going to add the seasonings.
so seasoning salt.
some beef bully, and because i do want to have a rich beef flavor and a good swirl of pepper garlic, of course does n't hurt a thing.
some dried oregano some drag time, and then the rest of the red wine that i did n't add to the pen and finally these great drippings, which is going to go in he ran really make this dish sing.
and then the bacon that we crisped earlier.
so now we 've added all of the flavorings, including the crispy bacon, and i 'm going to set it in the slow cooker where it will cook on low for four hours.
so let 's see, how things are going here, you can get drunk on that favorite is.
we have one thing to do yet.
and , that is adding ketchup.
and you may ask why now, well, i 'm doing it because i did n't want the tomatoe flavor to be lost in this long simmering stew.
so i 'm going to keep the intensity of the tomato flavor by adding it near the end and the fresh mushrooms go in.
as , well, i 'd love the fresh taste of mushrooms, and i wanted to be able to maintain that.
and they simply do n't need to cook as long as the beef does.
so here we go stir them in the lid goes back on and that only needs to heat for another ten to fifteen minutes just enough time for me to make.
noodles i am going to have noodles with beef, burgundy on top for dinner tonight, so, let 's see, how things have progressed here.
it is exactly the consistency i wanted.
it 's nice and thick.
this is a birthday where the meal an i say that.
because our son in law routinely asks for beef, burgundy for his birthday dinner whenever i am cooking for him and ask him what he would like.
how can you beat this?
but really i, gotta test it to make sure worse every extra effort related to the bacon.
the brown bits and the late edition of the ketchup in the mushrooms, which is great food.
