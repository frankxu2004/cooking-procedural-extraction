welcome to japanese.
cooking one, oh one today.
we are making dahmen, dahmen is a very popular noodle soup in japan.
there are millions of lemon restaurants in japan from mom and pop chinese restaurants in neighborhoods luming street carts open late at night too sophisticated lemon specialty shops.
one thing that they have in common is that they all think that their lemon is the best.
they spent hours or days to prepare good broth and ingredients of the super.
the top secret julie pork chicken or seafood is used for the base of the soup and that.
it 's then season with soy sauce missile or salt the type of noodle to use is just as important.
the wheat noodles called chuka men must have a firm and chewy texture.
so how do we make our lamb in as good as the alignment shops in japan honestly that 's in mission impossible.
however , we can make it almost as good and easy enough to make it at home, will show you how here are the ingredients?
we use pork to make our broth and also use the medias , toppings.
good sea salt, fresh ginger garlic and lots of green onions, soy sauce sake salt, and sesame E oil for flavor.
our biggest secret is the noodles.
it 's very hard to find good jukka men noodles outside of japan, especially the fresh kind, we tested different types of dried to commend that are sold in the US.
but none of them came out as good as we want it.
so what 's the secret.
believe it or not, we are using fresh angel hair pasta which you can find in the refrigerated section.
at many grocery stores, we boil.
the pasta with baking soda to get a distinct laman, noodle flavor, blanched bean sprouts and boiled eggs for toppings for exact measurements of the ingredients.

so the next day, we put the salted pork in the pot with water and add slices of fresh ginger and green onions bring it to a boil and simmer for one and a half hours.
an remove the pork and strain.
the liquid into another part now we 're seasoning the soup at soy sauce.
sake , salt and some sesame E oil.
keep , it hot while will prepare the noodles and the toppings just like making pasta.
that timing is everything, and you need to have everything ready to go before the noodle is cooked.
chop up some green onions and sliced the pork, you should also have the bold eggs.
anna sprouts ready to go.
then the noodles at some baking soda in the hot water be careful because it may boil over and at some angel hair pasta.
make sure you do n't over cook the noodle.
remember that the texture is very.
