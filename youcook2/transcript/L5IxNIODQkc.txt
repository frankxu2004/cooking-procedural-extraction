i 'm chef eric crowley, owner of the culinary class room in west los angeles and today, i 'm going to show you how to make a smoked salmon eggs.
this is also has different titles like a norwegian eggs benedict or eggs, montreal.
what we 're going to need is some hollandaise sauce or video of which you can see elsewhere.
i 'm a hollow dot com.
also , some poached eggs, you can also see that video elsewhere at mall.
oh , we have some posted english muffins.
some smoke, salmon norwegian.
hence norwegians eggs, benedict room temperature is absolutely fine.
we 're going to start off with our eggs after we wind up coaching them and we shot them in ice water and drain them.
we 're going to repeat them.
and we can actually use the same water that we use to make our hollandaise sauce with.
so i take my poached eggs item into my barely simmering water and they only need to sit in there for about thirty seconds or forty.
five seconds were really just looking for the eggs to be in there long enough to warm them up and take the chill off.
we do n't want to cook them anymore.
so it 's really important that after the eggs come out of the water.
we have a trade that has some paper towels in it 'cause we need to actually block the eggs dry, if you want to pick in the eggs out of the water and start to assemble your ex montreal or your smoked salmon benedict when the hollandaise sauce gets, onto the wet eggs is just going to wind up deluding the sauce and getting it to run all over exhibit in the water long enough lift amount out.
get him on some paper toweling going to block him dry.
but our smoked salmon on are toasted english muffin.
follow it up with the egg and last.
but not least are hollandaise, a really nice change of pace from a classic eggs.
benedict easter is coming up, this would be a wonderful brunch dish.
you could easily do many steps way ahead of time, you can poach the eggs ahead of time toast english muffins.
the smoke salmon only needs to be room temperature, make your hollandaise at the last minute, and, that is a classic brunch dish smoke, salmon eggs, benedict, or eggs.
