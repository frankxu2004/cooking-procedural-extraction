i 'm going to be showing you how to make it grilled ham and cheese sandwich delicious.
that 's all you need on a cold winters day.
so what you 're going to need is two slices of white bread, three to four slices of cheese.
i 've used creare cheese, which is a swiss cheese two slices of ham on two tablespoons of butter.
now we have a cast iron pan here.
which we 've already preheated to medium heat, and it 's nice and smoking.
we want to get that cast iron pot.
nice and hot for a grilled cheese sandwiches, so.
let 's get our white bread and.
let 's get our butter on the bread, you can never have too much butter on a grilled cheese.
that 's what i say.
so will spread that over there obviously if you prefer to use margerine.
what have you, you can do that?
we 're using the good stuff.
the real stuff alright got a nice generous amount on their lots of layering because that 's going to go onto our hot pan and make our bread.
nice and brown and crunchy.
so do it on both sides so once we 've lathered up butter on two, are gorgeous bread right here?
let 's put our bread butter, face down on to our cast iron pan.
you see, that 's going to sizzle right there now.
let 's get our lovely gruyere cheese on top of this, this is as i said, is a swiss cheese?
you 'll see it a lot in quiche is in a croc madame frog micere.
it 's really a great cheese to use when cooking it 's kind of got a distinct flavor.
but yet it 's not too overwhelming.
so it 's a good one.
so as that 's going, going up there well got archies onto our bread right there.
now let 's get our ham obviously if you want to go on fancy, you can do like forrest time or the ham of your choosing, just going to cut it in half here to make things easier.
let 's just lovely.
so you got your harm, your cheese, and that 's going to lose on to there, and then finally let 's get our other side of our bed butter.
