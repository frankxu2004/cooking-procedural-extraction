what 's up everybody welcome to make this your online cooking show in which i show y'all how to make some food.
now today would be making something called kobe beef AKA korean short rib barbecue.
you may have had this over at a hawaiian barbecue.
i guess you can say such as and ellen, ellen, oh, noes or any other hawaiian restaurant out there, but today will be doing my version of it.
so sit back relax, and here come the ingredients all right, so the very first ingredient.
we 're going to be needing in kobe.
beef is obviously the beef part and here we have korean style, short ribs.
if you can find it in your grocery store, ask the year.
butcher , these cool enough to cut him as you can see there 's three bones here and this is actually the short rib area so a good cut.
next we 're going to need one small onion right here.
i 'm using a sweet onion, but you can also use a yellow onion.
just one small one we 're also going to need mirren AKA rice wine, and we have about both look up in here next.
we have to use a sesame E seed oil.
south potent were always about two tablespoons, right here next.
we have a cup of soy sauce.
we also have half a cup of water kind of smooth soy sauce, uh, we have next a cup of firmly packed white brown sugar or golden brown sugar.
here it asked for garlic, but my little twist is like using shallots.
i have one large shallot here.
this nicely diced up if you ca n't get shallots or if you do n't want to shallots use about four cloves of garlic chopped up roughly like this and the last ingredient is something called an asian pear, kind of like an apple.
but really a pair only use one.
if you ca n't get this.
i do n't know really what to say to substitute.
maybe not so much of a granny, smith.
maybe a granny smith with a half a cup of i do n't know.
i do n't know.
i have n't really thought about that, but maybe use a pair another different type of bear pair, but we have one cut up.
so here are all the ingredients.
these right here.
sesame E seed oil rice.
when it came near in brown sugar, shall it 's small onion soy sauce, and the short itself, oh, one more thing we always need pepper, always had this around, and this is what we 're going to be using to make.
or kobe beef.
so i 'm gonna show, you.
how to put this all together, so here are the steps to make kobe beef.
actually what we 're going to be making right now is the marinade for it.
so already, to do.
now is take all our wet ingredients and thrown into this bolt and by what ingredients, i mean, or soy sauce are half a cup of water.
stamford mentioned earlier are sesame E seed oil next we 're going to put our mirren or rice, wine and here and that should be it.
for all the wet ingredients now.
next , to add here.
is the brown sugar cause i want to dissolve it in the liquid message back?
so we get this quick fear.
all right now we 're going to start adding or other ingredients, layer vegetables and everything.
so i 'm going through the onions in there, and the shouts side, now for the asian pears, you can just dump him as whole.
but i 'm just going through women like this make it all up all in there now, we 're going to sit in here.
and we 're going to prepare the meat.
so the next part of the procedure for all this is pairing the meat.
you can leave it as is and throw in the marinade.
but i 'd like to cut him up into three equal pieces.
and then have a marinade this is personal preference you can leave like this.
i like typical smaller, so.
we 're going to do that as we have three bones here.
so i wo n't do that to mine like i said even asshole personal preference.
cut short ribs into three equal pieces or not equal.
but three pieces through a marinade now you the best tools your hands can start mixing amin.
the marinade kind of merge all the meat in there.
all right, when everything is nicely covered, we 're gonna let this sit here in marinade for at least four hours.
all you see the longer the better.
but we 're going to let this marinade four hours, or more for overnight if you can all right guys army.
it 's been marinating for awhile, then there 's the meat right there, the marinating for four hours already now, when will cook it?
there 's a lot of ways, clicking it, you can grill it.
i wanted to grow it, but where i live it 's hot.
so i said, screw that i 'm going to do it in the pan.
i wanted to use my cast iron skillet pan, but i could n't find it so next.
best thing, and i 'm going to cook about three of AM, you can get the, get the idea afterwards.
but i 'm going to show you what it is and, well, see for me.
nice hot pan and the third one.
there you go so what 's good about.
this is that this is a good cook, up, fairly quickly, um, yeah, i said all you do is keep an eye on it.
maybe flip it once.
so look at the stuff.
cooking go look underneath.
it there you go looking over see this app does not take that long to cook practically done, so i do n't know.
maybe about two three minutes aside just watch it, have a nice crust color on it there?
we go better.
miss cross color, like i said this stuff cooks fast.
so you can do it on pan on the grill outside.
however you want and basically it guys.
so that 's how you cook it.
let 's go see the end product there.
it is guys.
kobe beef AK, korean short rib barbecue, as it looks like no front or front close that 's good, give a little trite.
huh , well, like about it is that there is with the onions.
you can take a little bit of the onions live with the rice wine, but there 's it 's not overly sweet.
you figure without that fruit.
i guess can save from the, the sweetness from the pair and the brown sugar would be overly sweet.
but not it 's actually a nice blend, nice balance to it.
anyways , the almost says try this out, do you guys like what i 'm doing like it share it subscribe all down here and if you do n't, i do n't care.
so until next time remember eat.
