launch , hi, welcome to show me the curry dot com.
i 'm hazel and malaysia and today, we 're going to show you how to make a very popular dish chat.
and our chicken, which is from the southern part of india, part of tamil nadu, couple of steps involved first, we 're going to dry roast a lot of our spices to really bring out the aroma and flavor of these prices.
so we have a pan heating up here on medium heat medium to low heat, and we 're going to be dry, resting anytime, you 're dry, roasting avoid non stick, stick to something and, and not nonstick.
so , first goes in this is that an inch and a half piece of cinnamon, which is going to break it down.
so it all cooks evenly three whole green cardamoms for clothes about seven to eight red chillies, depending on how spicy you like it and how spicy which of these are absolutely.
so are some are not very spicy.
and some are so using review of this and a few of that.
just so that.
because the colour the flavor and a little bit of spice.
but not yourselves, and i just broke them down again it releases a lot of the seeds from inside, and flavors everything.
one and a half teaspoons of human seats, one and a half teaspoons of fennel seed, two TSP of coriander seed and one tablespoon of poppy seeds or cuss, cuss.
you 're going to mix it, and we 're going to keep storing it as soon as it reaches a nice golden color.
we 're going to add half a cup of coconut.
this is fresh coconut which have been shredded.
now we going to cook this, or keep roll sing it, and it still on lower going to keep roasting it till the coconut gets a little bit of a color, and it, basically kind of gets a little dehydrated.
this looks damn.
it kind of dehydrated, and a concern of the store transfer, it.
allow , it to cool down and meanwhile start working on the next step.
there are masallah that we dry roasted has cooled down to the touch is not hot anymore.
and we have a grinder here.
we 're going to take this in sala and grind it into a smooth paste.
and we 're going to use a little bit of water to help.
and , one of those is doing.
that 's we have over here large skillet now, you want to big enough skills to be able to use to accommodate everything.
we are making, uh, bigger amount this time.
so here we have three tablespoons of oil and let 's check and make sure it 's hot and add one large onion finely chopped.
and i 'm just going to add little bit of salts to, to speed up the process, and we 're going to cook it till the onions get a little translucent.
and while i 'm writing this.
masala , i 'm just going to add a little bit of water at a time.
you do n't want to add too much or it kind of prevents.
the grinding from happening, starting with about a quarter cup.
can onions are done?
they look brown, and they 're ready.
we 're ready for one tablespoon of minced garlic, one tablespoon of minced ginger, and half a teaspoon of turmeric powder.
we also have a few sprigs of curry leaps and a little extra really taste good in this recipe, and we just going to cook it for a minute and now, we 're ready for the based now.
we let the dry roasted spices cool down completely and then used a spice grinder to grind it down, and we have to use about half a cup of water to help us in the grinding process.
so it 's finally ground into a paste.
we 're going to add it in.
and once he 's gonna red chili powder, and we just going to cook it or just another minute more.
now gentlemen food is known for a lot of flavor.
also , a lot of fights so, you know, there 's a lot of places where you can cut back and you could still get the flavor.
so do n't be scared of that aspect of the fish coconut there.
so that also neutralizes the effect of a chili and already had two large tomatoes , chopped.
i mix so basically just cook until the oil separates and we 're going to cook it, uncovered sore masala, mixture has cooked down quite a bit and oil is kind of leaving.
the files were ready to add our chickens were using approximately two and a half pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs, but it 's completely up to you.
whether you want to have bone on bone or any other part of the chicken and mix.
so , i mix it well, and we 're just going to allow you to cook for about five minutes on medium heat itself.
so it 's been five minutes, and we 've been staring in between just to make sure nothing gets burned all our hard work does n't go down the drain.
i render fabuleux, it does an amazing.
the color is amazing aroma and my god, but now is the perfect time to add your salt little bit.
we also had in the beginning in the onions, so just keep that in mind, and we 're going to squeeze some fresh line.
this is to taste, i 'm just going to make threats.
and we 're going to add about between two and three cups of water depending on the consistency that we went so we 're going to start with two.
and if we need more will add it i 'm just going to add a little bit into my spice grinder.
so i do n't waste any of that yummy spice do n't freak out.
it 's going to take a nap.
the gravy is going to get thicker, and it also it will evaporate a little bit.
and you want to have the option of having to dry sore which parties.
actually tastes very good with those who is this an interesting.
an once it fixed, will cover and we 're going to cook this for approximately twenty to twenty five minutes.
but basically, until the chicken is tender wake me in twenty minutes are chicken looks fantastic.
we just kind of grow for peace over here itself, and it broke really easily.
so it means it 's tender and is ready to go.
and also we checked on the salton.
the spice level and everything, and it was perfect so not a, not a soul.
and they end up quite a bit.
if you notice all the, the watery stuff has gone out.
and it 's like it 's nice smooth gravy.
here the perfect on rice anne right before serving as always we 're going to garnish with a few coriander or cilantro leaves.
and it 'll be ready to serve.
so enjoy attended, not chicken, and join us again.
another sort of show me the car dot com, adding a penta spice to your life.
