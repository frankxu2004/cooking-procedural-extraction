hey , it 's dan mcdonald the life regenerator.
what 's up you asked for it.
you got it.
we 're going to keep with these recipes that are real practical and inexpensive and simple to do.
and i 'm going to have darrell run you through this one.
so what are we going to do today.
sauerkraut alright, thank you.
it 's dara, anion here with dan, the man and this is our first time making sauerkraut, and it 's not just any sauerkraut it 's raw living sauerkraut, not the cooked kind, and the reason we 're making it today is that you can go to the store and buy sauerkraut, and if you can find the living stuff it 's really expensive.
so we want to make you independent of all of that expensive food so, i 'm going to show you.
dan , can you show them sure go ahead and start so basically i 'm going to show you the tools that we need a cutting board.
we have a big glass jar so that we 're going to put all the sauerkraut in, here.
after the, the cabbage and all the vegetable ingredients are inside.
we 're going to wait it down with a plate inside an glass of water.
a jar of water to push it down.
so we have as far as the vegetables, you can use a lot of different things, but cabbage is the main ingredient onion him.
garlic , we have diakon radish and carrots.
we 're going to use a little bit of salt and that 's it.
so , first i 'm going to show you how to properly cut a cabbage.
if there 's an easy way to do it so we 're going to kind of cut it in half first.
and you kind of take out the outside layer and i 'm going to cut in a little V shaped cut out the core, and that 's it.
and you just cut it in half like this, and we 're going to end up putting it in the cuisinart with the shredding blade.
an i will show you.
so that 's the cabbage.
i 'm going to end up doing that one the same way.
this is the diakon radish.
do you choose the ends of these, you can?
so i peeled one, and we 're going to end up, dan said, he likes this one kind of sauerkraut that has little slices of it.
little round discs, so i 'm going to use this little handy mandolin, and i highly recommend using a glove to protect your fingers.
there are ways, there are mandolins that have a little safety of safety guard.
but i like to do it this way, so, i think that 's in the shop.
the icon by hand if you want to, absolutely you can do all of this by hand, you can just thinly slice everything.
but for speed, the cuisinart does wonders.
so everything can be done by hand, great.
and so, so what we 're about to do is independence for all living sauerkraut to make you independent of expensive raw food.
so what do we want to do first.
i guess i 'll show you the.
yeah , go ahead, then you get these little pieces see, and there 's some more perfect once you can get perfectly round once you get in the swing of it, it gets a lot easier then you make a whole big bowl of those, and i 'm not going to do the whole thing.
while you 're watching we 're going to cut this, and then come back when all of the pieces are ready to go in the cuisinart is that we 're going to show him the little bit with the cabbage.
shred the cabbage show him.
a little bit of everything and then we 'll take a break and will chop everything up.
so , so this is the shredding blade.
it goes like this displayed, goes at the bottom of the cuisinart, and this one sticks.
i could n't figure out what to do with it when i got mine.
and i finally watched the video and there we go so it goes like that shut and turn it on.
so all you want to do is this is the pride that turns it on it, so we have to do this a little bit thinner to fit in.
actually , you can put, put it down right in there right there.
you go camera.
so that 's the cabbage.
we 're going to do the green and the purple and then we can do the same thing with carrots show mccarron.
i like to do this part so to sum it up.
what you do is you take everything that you see here, and you shred it or chop it in any way that you see fit, yeah, so.
but it basically, we 're going to run everything through the shredder here, and then the one important thing that you need is a nice big bowl 'cause you 're going to put all the ingredients in here and squeeze them and let them sit with assault that they have juices, and when it 's juicy that 's when you can put it into the glass container.
so we 'll get to that part.
OK , cool, so we 're going to take a little break here.
red , and chop everything, and then we 'll come right back.
so stay tuned, alright we 're back everybody.
and what we 've done so far.
is he basically decided to shred everything and cuisinart, including the diakon, radish.
because it was going to take a little bit longer to make little mandolin slices.
so everything has been shredded?
it 's colorful and.
now i 'm going to add some salt probably about four teaspoons and the salt is going to help break it down and get the juices out of the vegetables.
so that there 's enough liquid.
so what we 're going to do is mix it now with your hands and give you a really good mix.
an in about a half an hour, this should be juicy enough.
so that when, we put it into the glass container, there will be enough juices from the vegetables to cover vegetables.
do you want a little bit of liquid, rising above which is why we 're going to wait it down and push with the plates that the juices stay on top.
so it stays moist?
and the premise is, is that the vegetables are going to ferment the vegetables were going to start digesting themselves.
so that the digestive enzymes are in play.
so we do n't have to work.
our body does n't have to use its own digestive enzymes to work to digest it so.
it 's easy to digest, and it 's healthy flora.
so there you have it, we 're going to let this sit and come back to you in a little bit.
thanks T kiss.
so what 's next is that everything has been kind of marinated in its own juices between the salt and my really squeezing.
i got a lot of the liquid out of the vegetables.
so now we 're ready to put it into this jar.
see how much liquid is down in there see that oh good work i 'm going to fill it about three quarters of the way full.
and you want to check it every day, and if there 's any foam or any mold you 're going to remove it and depending on the temperature of the room.
you want to do it, keep it, store it in the dark kind of not too hot not too cold room and in about four days, approximately it could be ready.
and you 'll taste it and see if it 's our enough for you.
so , you can always leave it to ferment longer.
and once you 're ready you keep it in a sealed glass jar in the refrigerator, and it could last for awhile and it 's nice.
you have a your family, some people say you should be eating these things every meal probiotics.
cool , so let me see here.
we spent about ten bucks on vegetables and it 's usually ten bucks for a little jar.
i 'll show you guys a jar if we still have that here.
it is so this these jars right here.
are ten bucks, so we just made about for ten bucks, we probably made about six of those?
so we 've got six times our moneys worth by making the sauerkraut ourselves.
and we 're about twenty minutes into the process from the time that we started in the vegetables and then we she marinated it here with her hands for about five or eight minutes or so.
so it 's really not as time consuming as i thought very easy and then you can just eat lots of it and not.
feel guilty that you 're just wasting money.
and this helps you to be independent to be able to be a raw foodist and not have to spend so much money.
so we 're really conscious about giving you some recipes that are affordable and accessible.
so i 'm placing this plate in here.
and i 'm going to press it down so that the juices cover the vegetables.
then , you wait it, with a clean a large clean stone or a mason jar filled with water.
we can begin to digest itself, and then ideally, i think that the jar would be a little bit lower.
we could have filled it with a little bit less.
but you cover it with a towel.
and then you go and then in about four days.
it 'll smell really funky and be really good for you.
so i hope you enjoyed that anything else than i think you did a fantastic job i want to thank you so much for sharing this stuff with everyone.
i 'm sure they really appreciate it, i know i do.
i 'm counting down the days till we get the grub on that stuff.
thanks alot, dara everybody take care guys.
we love ya.
