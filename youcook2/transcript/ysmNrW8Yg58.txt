my name is dominic, arsenium.
the wiener chef here at silver oak cellars.
i 'm here in our oakville property today, and one of my favorite recipes of prepare with our cabernet sauvignon, says wood oven pizza.
i 'm going to show you how to make wood oven pizza, and we 're going to bake it in the oven, behind me at over eight hundred degrees.
the pizza we 're going to make for you today, is a classic pizza, margherita.
we 're going to make that with little bit of fresh mozzarella fresh tomatoes, heirlooms from the garden.
we have read some yellow little bit of green, some of the pizza dough that we made for you earlier little bit of genoa basil, some opal basil and then will finish it with some black pepper sea salt and olive oil.
we 're going to start this piece by slicing a fresh mozzarella.
now i 've chosen a fresh mozzarella that 's made from whole milk as opposed to skim milk.
you 'll find that it helps to melt a little bit better in the oven, when you 're baking it.
we 're going to slice it really thin, here just like.
so into some nice thin pieces and that will also help the cheese melt in the oven, are tomatoes?
i 'm using i 'm using fresh tomatoes as opposed to can.
we 're simply going to cut them and then what i like to do after i cut them.
i like to crush them in my hands here, so we 're going to kind of just take him with my hands and kind of into smaller pieces.
and they 're going to cook down together and make their own sauce.
we 're going to take a little bit of fresh basil.
some opal basil, here tear those leaves, inside tearing it is a traditional way of preparing.
basil keeps it from bruising your knife.
can kind of bruise the basel turning black when you simply tear it, it keeps its color looks fresher?
we 're going to go in with a little bit of sea salt, like that, a little bit of olive oil as well, and then finish with a little bit of cracked, black pepper.
once you get all those ingredients together, inside were simply going to give it a, a gentle mixed together the olive oil and salt and the basel is going to penetrate into those tomatoes it 's going to start breaking down those tomatoes a little bit better and then that will be a great sauce we have our pizza dough in a little bit of flower here going to take some of the flower, and i 'm just going to dust my pizza peel here that 's going to help it slide into the oven nice and easily.
so we 're going to pichardo up.
now this pizza dough recipe is designed to be release often easy to stretch and you can see as i pick the dough up the weight of the dough itself will do all this stretching for you and i 'm simply giving it a simple rotation around here to get all sides evenly.
so will stretch it out round at which point will go around a couple of times and then will lay flat will see how big it is, is that the size that we want it, yet if not going to take this part of my hand here the outside and we 're going to lay the dough onto it like.
so and i 'm going to hold it do the same transferring motion here and again the natural weight of the dough is what 's going to stretch it out once you feel you get it to the size you want you 're going to lay it back out and we 're stretch it a little bit more here to get to our final shape at this point we 're ready to top the pizzas now, going to take our heirloom tomatoes and you want to get a lot of the tomatoes, down onto the pizza here pretty much get those down, first, all over the entire pizza on, on all edges, some of the green a little bit of the read, some of the basel as well, and then after you do you take some of this sauce here the olive oil in the tomato juice, mixture and you 're going to want to get that all around the pizza it 's going to help dissolve together cook the tomatoes down to be part of the sauce and then we 're going to put in a little bit of our fresh mozzarella.
now put some slices of the fresh mozzarella down i 'm going to do about six pieces of the mozzarella, you can do more if you like depends on how much you like all around like.
so and then a final piece right in the center at this point are pieces ready to go into the oven, and you 're going to go straight in a little shake and pull it out like.
so now the pizza is going into the heart, the heart of this oven is at eight hundred degrees fahrenheit, now, the flames are lapping up the side, creating a thousand degree dome from the top, what 's happening is the dough is searing on the outside the flames are lapping up the top of the dome and brew laying the pizza from the top this pizza is only going to take about sixty seconds we 're going to see a little bit of browning on the left side here that 's the same side that the fire is on once we get a nice kind of even browning we 're going to rotate it part way here will go in.
here now going to pick it up.
here we give it a rotation around.
like , so just, like that, we 're going to let the other side of the pizza brown, up.
we like to use a couple different types of wood for my wood, have n't we use white oak?
does a nice real intense heat.
we also use old barrel staves from the winery.
we take the old wine barrels.
we break them down will throw them into the oven as well, and then even some old grapevines boom baby, the pizza is done.
we 're going to take it out.
now i 'm going to hold it up taller.
and what happens is that heat from the top is going to brule the top a little bit more, and then we 're going to pull the pizza out.
after the pizza comes out of the oven i like to take a little bit of olive oil and just brush on the crest.
here , brush the sides all the way around will finish it with a little bit more basil on top.
some of that opal basil.
and , then also a little bit of the genoa basil as well, we 're in during our pizza with some silver oak alexander valley, cabernet sauvignon.
here at the.
winery , fine wine is meant to be shared with family and friends but everyone.
