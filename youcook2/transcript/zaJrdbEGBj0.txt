so today i 'm going to show you how to make some homemade beef burgers from jamie oliver 's ministry of food.
so here 's a list of the ingredients five hundred grams of mincemeat.
what 's a dijon mustard.
some olive oil salt and pepper sometime one egg.
some rabbits is, and some human.
so the first thing i 'm going to do is break arrive eaters beat liac and take the time off the stalks.
OK , so what i 've done is at my five hundred grams of mincemeat to a bowl of picton, chopped their time.
put some right betis and some greaseproof paper just rolled a rolling pin over it just to make it sort of like a dust.
another peyton, wanaque into a bowl.
so all i 'm, gonna do now is add all the ingredients.
so i 'm just going to very put the minutes a little bit, and i 'm gonna go.
and with the right basis now you could use jacobs, crackers, or even make some bread crumbs.
if you wanted be there in with all the time i 'm using time you could use parsley, or you could use dried oregano.
whatever where do you fancy, and maybe your neck sprinkler human not much salt and pepper and two teaspoons, dijon mustard.
how are you doing now?
just got your arms in get a good scratch together.
you basically just want to do that until it becomes all mixed in and say that you can solve roll into a ball.
so you ca n't really see them into me anymore.
warm big bowl of meat.
OK , so, once you call you meet nice and next, and scratched off.
yeah , about a bowl of meat like that, compact, it together as much as you can in your hand and then just sort of roll into a bowl once you got like a nice bowl she start to roll it flat and just push it out.
and you have when you get something like that, so we put it on the side.
just keep pushing on it will start to crack around the actual.
actually , do just will join them cracks back together?
so rolled over just keep pushing on.
so you got sort of thickness and size that you want.
you do n't want to be too thick in the middle.
just keep pushing it out of, of money to make three burgers out of that, which is all i know you, and i still got all of that left.
so what i 'll do without was rather than make burgers.
i will just make smaller ones smaller balls, all that.
and i 'll make as many of them as i can, and i love their like pasta meatballs with it.
so that we save in the fridge, or in the freezer, and you can just have it in her birthday.
OK , so i 've managed to make three good size burgers and a load of meatballs for another day.
so we need to do now is getting rid of pan on high until just about smoking.
and then turn it down to medium you are dribble a little bit of olive oil onto each one.
you believe this and just give it and robin, you seem to be beside.
i 'm not ready to go in the griddle pan.
now you can roll these out, and griddle and straight away.
they are best to probably stay in the fridge for about five minutes, just become a lot more therma.
if you can give him if you 've got time to give him time in the fridge if not just growing straight away, and they take about three to four minutes on each side.
but i will just cut one open and make sure it 's cooked before you serve it, i guess, i cook back to douglas on the griddle pan for about five, six minutes about two and a half minutes, three minutes.
aside now i 'm just going to play some cheese on top and put them under the grill for about and then it.
also , until the cheese is bubbling OK, so the villagers have been underground just for the cheese to melt for a couple of minutes.
popline football spring, on you tomorrow.
thank you so much.
send it in a mate potato wedges, and that 's it.
i make burger and chips good.
