eighth day, drink dot com wet inside the kitchen and got the scoop from chef anthony, keen on how to make a traditional british dish at home fish and chips, my name is anthony kim here at the london hotel gordon ramsay, and i 'm going to teach you how to make a traditional london england UK fish and chips.
they should chips.
this is like the traditional british, why it 's been a traditional dish in england for quite some time.
do you think they 'll be eating fish and chips at the royal, well?
if they 're not they should be fish and chips is a great dish here.
at the london hotel gordon ramsay restaurant we serve it at the bar.
as a matter of fact is available anytime of the day, and we put a lot of effort into it.
i think it 's one of the best in town.
if not, the best in town step number one we 're going to make the charter sauce get it out of the way that i have here, are, eggs, whole eggs, kind of vegetable oil.
when you soybean oil, parsley pickles pickle juice capers, onions will go to squeeze the lemon juice into number two is going to be the fish were going to play the fish today.
i 'm using how about a nice seasonal white, flat fish whitefish, it 's going to be flaky fish, fish and chip into pieces that we want dippenaar batter and fry number.
three is better now.
you could simply by a tempura batter, if you will a fritter batter this year happens to be.
i 'm going to make my own little bit of cornstarch, little bit of pastry flour and a little bit of wonder flower that mixture 'cause it gives me a nice crispy batter alright.
i 'm going to take that a little bit of salt, and i want to add my sparkling water to it.
that carbonation kind of lightens up the batter a little bit like i said some other people may use a beer or something like that, to get that carbonation.
but today i want to use a sparkling water twenty minutes half an hour, once again to let the flower absorb the water.
the oils important, you do n't want it to be too hot.
they do n't want to be too cold.
you want that you want it to be just right now because if it fries too fast.
the batter is going to be.
it 's going to be done with fish is going to be raw.
it takes two small fries, too slow.
the oil is going to be absorbed by the batter, next step is to take your fish at, you fill, aid, and you want to do it one.
the best in town final step, well, we 're going to take our charter sauce.
add it to whatever you want to add it to.
well , maybe, maybe do n't want to add it to anything at all.
maybe just want to put it on your plate, like that we have some green peas is, not necessary.
but it 's a nice little touch that we do here, you know, why they 're called fish and chips.
because you got fishing got chips.
so you ca n't forget the chips, chips are nothing more than a french fry.
your adaptation it could be anything you want it traditionally, and UK, it will be what we would probably refer to a steak fry.
something little bit thicker a little bit bigger, but cut it anyway.
you want here, i simply take some fryman butter instead of oil.
so there are potatoes that have to cut a fried little bit of oil a little bit of garlic butter, i should say , so.
there you go.
so we 're going to take these OK.
it does n't get any better than that, even if you 're not hungry, this will make you hungry fish and chips here at the london.
it does n't get any better than that.
i think will and kate would be more than happy to have this at their dinner.
thanks for the fish and the scoop.
now if you need more information on where to eat stay and drink in los angeles or any other parts of the world log on to eat they drink dot com.
