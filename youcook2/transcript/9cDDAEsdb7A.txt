today , we 're going to be making one of the world 's most popular fast foods where making KFC 's potato and gravy he 's got budget, deals monday.
what you want wednesday far through friday, what else could he share.
is nickos kitchen ware?
satisfying meals are prepared.
so is the first thing that we 're going to get started on our potato and gravy.
i 've just peeled some potatoes here and you can use any potatoes that you like.
and i 'm just going to cut them into hubs.
now over under the stove just into a large pot of put some water in there were going to boil that water up.
now to the water, i 'm going to add in some salt, and i 'm also going to add in some dried chicken stock just a small amount, we do n't want to launch just give that a good steward.
so it all dissolves to describe the potatoes that we had and just pop them in now.
we want to boil these for about seven to ten minutes, do n't let them go too mushy?
but we do n't want them to be too hard either because we are going to be mashing these potatoes.
so just keep an eye on them.
it should take anywhere between seven to ten minutes on a medium to high heat.
so guys our potatoes are cooked and you 'll know that if you just grab a knife and just run them to the edge of you here if this goes through and you hear it click on the side of the pen, you know, they 're done.
so just take them out.
i mean, all the water.
so i 've just put our potatoes into a ball guys and to the potatoes.
i 'm going to adding some butter, and i 'm also going to add in some milk that i 've warmed up and make sure the milk is hot.
and also give it a good generous seasoning of some salt just using a potato masher.
just give that a really good press down.
and that 's what you 're after guys.
this beautiful, no lumps, creamy, mashed potato.
so just put this to one side and now we 're going to get started on our gravy noise into a small pan over a medium to high heat.
i 'm going to add in some vegetable oil, and just leave the oil in the pan for about two to three minutes just to really warm up.
so now that the oil has heated up guys, what i 'm going to be pulling in is some flower and we 're just going to add in some small amounts at a time into the oil and just give that a good stare and keep mixing it around.
and we want to keep doing this guys.
once it 's all dissolved.
add some more flowering.
and what you 'll find is the mixture will actually start to turn a brown color, and that 's what we 're after so.
now once we 've got at that brown color.
i know it does n't really show up on the camera that will what you 're seeing at home and is a light brown color we 're going to start adding in some chicken stock should just add that straight into the pen and what you 'll find it will just all clumped together and just like we did with the flower just keep adding small bits at a time, and god will say this transformation take twice with the gravy in the chicken stock it will really start to thinking like a place.
think what if i done that trust, me just keeps?
tearing it because when it turns real dark around.
i want you to turn the heat straight off.
just keep mixing that through, and that 's what you 're after guys.
this beautiful thick brown chicken gravy, so that 's done so now it 's time to play this bad boy up.
now guys are two ways to serve this up, shut up in a ball, of course, if you want it straight now.
but if you 're having a picnic or something like that, just grab a container like that with a lid already on it and just put it in, there.
so guys there you have it, there 's my version of KFC 's gravy and potato mash.
now , of course there potato is the reconstituted dry stuff that they had to water, i do n't want to do that.
i would rather use the real potatoes.
but if you wanted to use the dehydrated mash to make it authentic then go for it.
so let 's give this boy a tried check it out this is one of those things it 's a real treat you do n't have this too often, check that out it 's almost like ice cream is the potato and a chocolate source.
it 's almost like a savory version of ice cream and chocolate source, it says exactly the same, exactly the same, so guys give this ago, please.
it 's not that hard to do, and i 'm telling it will save you heaps and heaps of money.
all the ingredients are below as always.
so check it out, you guys.
take her and i will see you this monday for budget meals.
so until then, take care.
