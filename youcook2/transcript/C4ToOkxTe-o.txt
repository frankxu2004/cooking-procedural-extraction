hey guys, today, i 'm going to show you how to make low fat vegan, hash browns.
so i 've got these organic red potatoes.
i have this tool is called a master cut.
you pretty much just hold the potato here.
and you can see inside.
here just comes up with all these little shoestring type of shreds it works pretty fast.
and then i 'll figure this out.
i do n't know if you can buy this tool called the master cut on line or what.
because it actually came with cookware that we bought like four five years ago.
so i have n't tried looking or i do n't know, but otherwise, a good tool is a cheese grater.
i read online.
that , of course, cheese grater can actually get these type of shreds out of potatoes, so, if you 're vegan and you do n't have a cheese grater that would probably make sense.
but borrows went out with someone or just buy one and use it.
so you can carve up, shredded potatoes every night.
so and this is three pounds.
i do n't know if i told you or not three pounds of organic red potatoes, and i 've got my ceramic nonstick pan right here.
and i 'm not going to use any oil.
i do n't recommend eating oil too high.
it 's just liquid.
fat is not going to do anything good for your body or your arteries.
so these are vegan, hash browns do n't use butter, do n't use oil?
if you have weird pans that maybe they 're not nonstick maybe use a tiny bit in the bottom and also that stuff does n't stick and get all crazy, or you could use a little bit of water too.
but i do n't recommend adding any oil, some foreign all this in the pan, and it might sound weird, but this is all one meal.
i 'm going to eat this whole thing, and i 'll probably make another batch for my husband.
he 's at work right now.
i 'm going to you can put herbs on it, or spices if you, if you really, really need salts, i mean, put a little on.
but i do n't really eat a lot of salt.
i eat a low sodium diet.
so i 've got these parsley flakes, dried parsley.
i 'm going to shake a little of this on wo n't even make sense.
just deal with the top off because not coming out very well, so i got some dried parsley.
i 'm sure you could do fresh parsley to even better and i 'm going to put a little bit of to merrick on.
i like it, then it makes it with yellow, and then some pepper cool and i 'll show you.
i got it kind of on a lower setting for the stove here, if you can see, like around three i do n't know what you guys are.
stoves are looking like.
but , yeah, cook it on low, and i 'm going to store all this around and cover it with this late, and i 'm going to set a timer, and after fifteen minutes, i 'm going to flip it and wait another fifteen minutes, and see if it needs to be flipped again.
otherwise it should be done.
and i 'll show you the finished product.
so we 're back with the final product, this is what it looks like beautiful.
i , i like to eat it with a little catch, up, if you 're worried about sodium or any other anything else, you got a problem with ketchup, you can make your own sort of a sauce on any kind of tomato sauce, low sodium pasta sauce.
you can use hot sauce barbecue sauce, or you could just eat it plain.
it 's really tasty and i 'm also going to eat it with some organic romaine lettuce.
wrap it up, or just munch on it.
get the greens in.
and i know, i lied earlier, i said i was going to be in this, all by myself, actually, are you helping me at twenty six week old little buddy in here, i 'm pregnant helping me eat this.
so it 's going to be delicious i eat this like almost every night, do n't worry, potatoes are going to make you fat and you 're going to feel amazing i want to see all you get healthy eat your fruits and vegetables, watermelon bananas, potatoes or even rice i got some rice over here rice dates eat your fruits and vegetables i want to see you get super healthy and go vegan.
