hi , fi tube, carry on here.
i 'm going to show you my simple scrambled egg recipe.
so what we 're going to do first which is most important is to put off frying pan on we 're going to put our toast.
i 'm using the griddle pan, but just that 's going to be able to push mode now.
i need six X and here i use happy eggs like happy chickens, one, two three four five six.
i 've also got some evaporated milk.
i 'm going to use just a splash about fifty mills.
you do n't have to use it.
you can use milk ordinary milk, you can use cream.
you do n't even have to put anything.
and if you do n't like it now, i 'm going to put a nice knobs of butter into the frying pan to cook the eggs.
now to stop the butter from burning.
i 'm also going to put in a little tiny drop of olive oil as well in that goes.
this toast is ready.
so i 'm going to grab that off and leave it there, see, that 's the best thing about this recipe to thicken.
wait the ex con, so we 're going to have a nice generous pinch of salt and again a generous pinch of pepper.
then , we 're going to beat them together simply with a folk.
this is such an easy recipe.
even the kids can do it, i mean, my children make scrambled eggs all the time.
nothing fancy just beaten eggs.
and then we 're going to go straight in.
so the frying pan.
now as you say, we want to use a wooden spoon as well.
because we do n't want to scratch the frying pan otherwise.
it wo n't be stiff nonstick anymore, but if you come in and have a look because we 've preheat the pan, the cooking process starts automatically straight away.
so , once you keep the eggs, moving as all, you need to do is just keep them moving around the pan around and around do n't leave.
it keep them moved in 'cause.
otherwise , they 'll just end up in a omelet and that 's not what this recipes.
we do n't want to cook them all the way because we 're going to leave them to rest.
so you 'll see here that this looks quite running still, but i 'm going to flatten it out over the pan, while i butter my toast.
and then you 'll see when we come back to that they will be perfectly cooked.
so just get some on the toast.
now i like bar as you can probably tell, but if you do n't you do n't have to use it.
you can use a drizzle of olive oil or nothing but splurge.
a little bit now, let 's go back to the eggs.
you can see now look the residual heat from that pan has cooked, them completely.
so because they 've set there a bit lumpy, so i 'm just going to chop them up a little bit.
and then this is for two people sex.
so we 'll just take half just put it, and then you know, my friends spangled X.
the most simple yet effective recipe eleven try out.
