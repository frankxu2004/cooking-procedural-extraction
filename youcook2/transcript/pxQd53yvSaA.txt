now check this out the first thing, you want to do is butterfly use friend just take a sharp knife down the backside of the shrimp.
just the same way you would devein it for three quarters of the way through and fan it open like this, as you can see from back or still intact here.
we 've got our tempura and our coconut will take her shrimp and wo n't get that straight in the tempura.
now i 've made it a little bit thicker than normal.
if you do n't know how to make that, then just click the link here on the left.
but after you get a completely soaked just drip, dry it and dip it in your coconut on all sides, and make sure it 's completely covered not just an aside now, having a thicker tempura allows you to get more coverage of the coconut and it keeps you from having to use panko to fill the spaces and that 's it that 's how it looks once you get enough of 'em, done you favored, a plate, you can move to the frying just a hot pan and some oil and then they go have about a quarter answer, peanut oil on that 's all you 'll need for the flying now, it takes a couple minutes per side, you may need to add more oil in between each batch.
but that 's OK, that 's completely normal.
i want to completely cooked just played it on some paper towels like this, it will absorb all the remaining oil fat that you want to get rid of before you start chewing on their shrimp.
i like to use orange chili sauce for the dipping sauce.
it just comes in a model.
