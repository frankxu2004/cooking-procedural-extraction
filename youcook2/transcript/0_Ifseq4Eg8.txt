we 're going to do a beautiful version of a ward off salad, OK, this is a classic salad from the waldorf hotel in new york.
i 'm still going to honor and respect the sort of basis of the salad, but i want to take it on a bit.
i want to express myself with relative grapes that healthy dressing.
i absolutely love it as a starter as a side salad amazing with their roast chicken and roast potatoes, first, up the classic part has to be the grapes.
so get yourself some lovely grapes.
so salt and pepper olive oil and a little squeeze lemon juice.
so dress it like a little salad, the original recipe had beautiful fresh grapes.
i want to get caramelization sweetness.
i want to get another vibe going on the rest of the grapes in that, seasoning.
this is in the word oven, about one hundred ninety degrees for about five to ten minutes see.
how it 's starting to just shrivel up and see that little red juice, we 're.
now going to go in my nuts back in what i 'm going to do.
next is celery peel off the worst of the stringy bits.
so i use a speed peeler to do this.
normally , people hack this end off and throw it in the bin, but this is like the crown jewels.
this is what the italians go mad for, i want to keep this heart or come back to that we have this.
here , slice them up, nice and delicate, the heart of the celery is often the part that everyone throws away.
look how beautiful, that is guys and the flavor is crunchy and fresh and really clean.
finally , slice, gorgeous.
we 've got remain lettuce.
take the first half because it produces gorgeous little cups, then i 'm going to finely slice the middle part.
and then i 'm going to cut this heart in half just like the celery.
i 'm going to do this for four people.
it 's only make a nice big salad sorry about the noise.
it 's making season.
i 'm at home in essex.
springs come the suns out.
it 's like got to do littles, love powell around here.
every corner you turn there is an animal at it so the original waldorf salad dressing was mayonnaise, based.
i 'm going to make something with the same vibe with better flavors, more dynamic flavors.
so a couple of tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil twice as much, organic yogurt, go and ice teaspoon of english mustard season.
it , with salt and pepper is quite nice to have a little squeeze of lemon juice is going to be a really nice little dressing the lovely color.
i can hear this stuff going off in here.

'cause we love it and it 's free and that 's the whole point more nuts, and then the golden bit, this juice.
it 's almost like a natural sort of great full sonic vinegar, do n't, do n't waste any of that?
i 've got my nice apple cut it, even thickness.
i 'm just going to slice this up the other way into matchsticks.
then we go across it up gorgeous colors, wonderful textures.
so i 've saved back couple of these grapes just to put on top.
a beautiful simple reinterpretation of that great classic salad.
but with roasted grapes that healthy dressing, i mean, this is n't all for me obviously this is for four people.
but i 'm just going to hang out and eat my funky little olive salad that is really good the roasted grapes, gives incredible sweetness and it works.
