chicken parmesan is one of the most popular menu items and italian american restaurants.
it 's really easy to make at home today.
i 'm going to show you how and the key to it for me for the whole thing is making sure you have a nice uniform chicken breast which means we 're going to use our meat mallet and flatten this one out 'cause you can see that the way of chicken breasts naturally shaped is a little thick around one side and sort of tapers down at another side chicken parmesan going to cook evenly once we get this all the same thickness.
but it 's also going to cook quickly, which is key also.
so you get that nice crispy crust.
so i 've just got.
i 've got triple layer here, you can use a gallon bag at home.
that 's what i do just make sure you 've got some good protection.
i 'm going to use the flat side of my meat mallet and the idea here is to do sort of a sweeping motion.
so as you come down just sort of pull away from you.
the idea is not to come straight down on the meat.
but hit it, and sort of pull away from you, and i use my hand here, just to keep the plastic wrap steady.
and the plastic wrap just keeps the chicken from sticking and the idea.
obviously you 've got the thinner side.
so you want to start by pounding the thicker side and again.
sort of a pulling motion and you 'll see.
that , after a couple of good wax, it just starts to move with the mallet, and i 'm looking for about a quarter of an inch.
again , nice consistency is going to be the key to your success here, so i 've got that pound.
and then you can see that 's what it looks like a nice even chicken breast great a raw chicken.
always want to be careful.
so i 'm using tongs, OK, just to handle the raw chicken.
and i 'll use a completely different set of tongs once.
i cook it, but i 'm going to get rid of my plastic wrap and clear my board.
and then i 'm going to show you the standard breading procedure.
so i have some all purpose flour.
have a cup of that?
i have three eggs here that i 've really taken my time and whisk them very, very well.
you want to hear the completely broken up and sort of foamy on top that we 're going to get good coverage and then i have some italian season breadcrumbs that i also added some more parmesan reggiano to just a bump, that flavor.
so what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to season the chicken breast with some sea salt and fresh cracked pepper alright.
we 're just building layers of flavor here, so obviously we want to make sure this chicken taste good before we get it into the breading.
and then i 've got a pair of tongs here.
makes the job a little cleaner right into the flower.
and the idea here is to get a nice even coat of everything on top of the chicken breast.
you want to make sure that there 's no spot of your chicken breast that 's not covered with flower 'cause we 're building a seal here.
and we 're establishing a crust and what we want is to not press it in.
we just want to make sure it 's nicely even coded.
and if you just get it coded very simply and very easily without trying to get too much on there it 's going to be light as a snowflake.
and that 's kind of what you want, you want to be really, really crispy on the outside and you do n't want that breading caked on so.
i just wanna make sure even coat all the way through, you know, you 'll see some people really press it down like to do that.
i 'd like to just flip it a couple of times cover the areas that are still uncovered with all three of these ingredients and there you go you, gotta perfectly breaded chicken breast right there.
so we 're just going to do that with all four of these chicken breasts, and then we 're going to saute independent or golden brown and crispy alright.
so i 've got my pan here preheated medium high started without a half a cup of pure olive oil.
i want to do these in batches, the idea here is to not overcrowd the pan.
so we get nice even browning again.
we wanted to pound the chicken so it 's nice even thickness.
we want to get nice even browning as well, the crust, such a compartment.
john is key.
so i 've already browned, too finish with these last two, let the oil get him.
nice and brown around the outside.
just a couple of minutes on each side till there.
nice and golden brown and then we want him to be at one hundred and sixty five degrees for a finished temperature alright.
so it 's been a couple of minutes.
i just want to go ahead and check him, yeah, that 's beautiful.
got that beautiful sort of paper bag brown that we 're looking for you can see the edges get a little crispier than the middle.
so you get that great textural difference going to be another couple of minutes on this side, and we 're going to build him get him in the oven alright.
so it 's been a couple minutes on this side before i remove them from the pan.
i just want to get right into the thickest part and again.
remember these are very evenly.
so the thickest part could be any other, but i still like to go in the middle just to make sure.
i 'm getting an accurate temperature units.
chicken , so we 're looking for a hundred and sixty five degrees.
another thing i like about chicken cutlets or breaded, cutlets in general is because we 're cooking him so quickly.
they 're going to still be nice and moist so then i 'm just going to remove these to paper.
towel just to train a little bit that excess oil off, and.
now i 've gotta clean set of tongs, does this chicken is already cooked, we 've hit our temperature and i 'm going to move it over to my cookie sheet that i have lined with some parchment paper.
i always think it 's a great idea to line any tray that i 'm using for baking with parchment paper.
really makes clean up a lot easier.
just go ahead chance to drain the same idea here.
we did n't overcrowd the pan.
we were browning am.
i do n't want to overcrowd the pan to make him as well, so i can just go ahead and get rid of that OK and now.
this is the fun part and this is what everybody always likes about chicken.
parmesan got some delicious season tomato sauce here.
and i 'm just going to go ahead and parse out over these chicken breasts, and you want to be again.
i 've talked about layering for this whole recipe.
you do n't want to have too much of anything.
you want to have just enough so you get a little bite of sauce.
crispy chick in and cheese in every single bite.
that 's the idea.
so i 'll just spread that out.
and i 'm just going to take the back of my spoon and sort of push it out almost to the edge.
so perfect, we 've got that i 've got a little bit of whole milk, mozzarella cheese, same ideas, the sauce now this cheese is going to melt.
and it 's going to spread out a little bit as it melts.
so , i try to keep it a little bit more towards the center just to accommodate for that.
but the good news is when it melts off the side to get those beautiful, crispy brown bits of cheese is sort of.
stick to the pan i always like to eat those all right and again chicken parmesan i want to gild the.
lily , just a little bit here.
i 've got a little more parmesan reggiano, remember, i put that in the season breadcrumbs during the breading process, and i want to take a little bit more as a nice sort of nutty and salty quality to the mozzarella, which is going to get all warm and soften GUI, there you go chicken parmesan going to put it in the oven for just a few minutes get that cheese melted.
get that sauce hot.
and we 're going to be ready to go alright that 's about eight minutes in the oven, and that 's exactly what i 'm looking for often GUI sauces.
hot classic lee always serve this with just a nice simple pasta simple tomato sauce, and this is perfect right there.
