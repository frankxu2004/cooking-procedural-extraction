if you 're looking for a great easy leftover.
you ca n't get any better than fried rice not only does it use cold leftover rice from your refrigerator with.
but you can throw kind of anything in there, and it makes a great meal today.
i 'm making a version with ground pork.
start off by mincing one sort of largest clove of garlic and one tablespoon of ginger or make sure that you peel it first and then very thinly slice it a cross two.
but i find that the yield on mince ginger is much greater than when you grade it.
and i do n't mind little pieces of ginger.
in fact, i love little pieces of ginger, so you cut it into little thin strips and then cut crosswise.
those strips intimates.
i 'd like to add a little bit of egg to my fried rice.
so i 'm going to scramble two eggs whisk them is with just a little bit of soy sauce.
about a quarter of a teaspoon that 's in place of salt, though i do find that sometimes you want to add just a little bit of salt to fried rice anyway.
because voice as well at salty, it does n't enhance the flavors to in quite the same way as solid.
so add about a tablespoon of oil to wok or nonstick, skillet over medium high heat.
add your eggs.
what you 're doing here is making a very thin omelet.
and it should cook really, really quickly in a hot pan in classic style.
you do n't even stir it.
you just sort of let it sit in there and set which is happening very quickly almost set.
you can flip it over.
i 'm going to do it guys good enough you 're going to cut it up into little pieces anyway.
take your eggs out sort of chop your egg or cut it into little thin shreds.
whatever you want the egg will be added back in after everything else is incorporated.
so you can just set that aside, while you 're cooking everything else.
add another tablespoon of oil to your pan and.
then , add one scallion just the white parts.
the green parts will save for later.
the ginger and garlic.
and you want to cook that until their fragrant.
it 's a half a pound of ground, poor.
if you 're using pre cooked pork like you had some leftover if you would add it at the end just to heat through.
but this port needs to be cooked when your pork seems to be almost completely done, which mine is nice and opaque, add two carrots, shredded half a cup of peas.
these can be defrosted frozen peas or any other vegetable.
then add two cups of cooked rice, the great thing about this recipe is leftover rice.
actually worked better than fresh rice, stir, and then you 're basically done except for the seasoning, and i 'm going to season this today with soy sauce and rice vinegar about two tablespoons of soy sauce and rice wine vinegar not can season kind.
but the unseasoned kind.
so plain rice wine vinegar, two tablespoons, the seasoned rice vinegar has sugar and other seasonings in it that does n't go.
so well with all things.
so i always by the unp seasons, it 's a very specific flavor.
now you 're wanting to keep everything through add reg dinner is served and i 'll tell you something else, this makes a fantastic breakfast simply fantastic use for leftovers and just like that dinner is on the table fried rice.
