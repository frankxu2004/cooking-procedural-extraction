and ever going to sing and cook my name is shepard pollen, you watching me cook a very famous dress, you know, in india.
what we do is go out to time specially on the highways.
now only highways you 'll find excellent harbors now.
these are kind of rustic restaurants.
but they 're very, very famous, you know, some of them are legends.
actually , everybody remembers going there and dining.
and i, i remember a few of them.
one of them is near bombay in lonavla, sometimes when i go to pune job i see this very famous java on the ambala road, bigger, and i 'm sure it 'll remind you off the chicken curry that you 've eaten there.
and that 's what i 'm trying to do now the highway check-in.
that 's what i 'm cooking for highway chicken curry.
want you require us quickly some onions, which i am.
now if you 're cooking around eight hundred grams of chicken on the bone essentially on the bone only OK, otherwise, no fun take at least four onions and i 'll slice them in the meanwhile.
what you need to do here.
vessel cooking vessel, on the flame oil here required is little more than usual now highway chicken carries.
are generally high frag rent dishes little spicier, that 's what the famous for that 's why we like them an garam, masala?
the blend and the whole garam, masala is little high.
so what i 'm doing is.
cinnamon here black cardamom four to five of them when you put blackhead among important open them up.
OK , otherwise what 's going to happen if they burst.
there 's a chance of you getting hurt.
so very important forty five of them small cardamom six eight of them nice fragrance, OK human one teaspoon, some clothes in here an before these thing born, i need to slice the onions wow manage to cook fast, and human, is nice and brown the moment you smell the fragments of the spices you add the sliced onion four of them is what i have sliced for approximately eight hundred grams of chicken on board that 's very, very important.
so the onions very rustic, correct the quantity of tomatoes added is also quite high in this and one more thing i must tell you the quantity of ginger and green chili is also high when you eat them, you must get that slurry thing must hear that this is what you need to hear that, that 's what we all like when we go out dining, specially the chicken correct take tomatoes three large tomatoes, and i 'm going to cut the chop them, actually i 've got chicken already in here.
now i must tell you the highway guys, you know, some of them use basic guy or saturated fact.
now i 've got some here you want to add it you can add it what 's going to happen is, is going to increase the test.
so if it 's a matter of taste, let me add one tablespoon of this just one tablespoon.
so that brings out the great flavor oil also aflao suddenly the profile changes the smell of this change is absolutely divine let this get brown tomatoes will be chopped more watchful eye in here.
stir this up as the onion.
start drowning up what you need to do.
next is be prepared with the ginger and garlic paste very important so, yeah, the quantity of ginger is more than the garlic.
that 's what i do hence the pacer separate.
but you have a choice you can use definitely.
ginger garlic paste, together and later, you can add the ginger julians that i 'm going to add ginger paste one and a half tablespoon.
garlic paste, one tablespoon salt for about a minute treat every ingredient with respect, the way you would do to your family members.
this is the family member off.
how did the hybrid chicken curry so let this?
sorted the smell should go off and then the models that going some people.
do add the tomatoes later after the chicken becaus, they think the quantity, i mean, the time taken to cook the chicken is increased, yes, becaus of the acidity?
it does happen, but i want the commanders to get pumping an machine, you know, so that the gravy becomes smooth.
if you have the chicken first and then the tomatoes, the tomatoes will not get pulpy, and you might not get a smooth gravy.
so after you add tomatoes, you need to cook for at least four, five minutes.
so that the whole mixture washer and smoother and then the.
next thing to let this get coke first for at least for five minutes now, as the tomatoes are getting pulpier see getting pulp here, which makes the gravy smoother what i 'm going to do is this will keep cooking and in the meanwhile, slice, some ginger and, cut some julians of this.
so take about half inch piece of ginger and cut julians of this app some green chilies three of them now, this is this spicy, oh, one.
so you need to be careful three of them if you do n't like it spicy you can avoid it.
but what you need to do is let it from the middle.
all this goes in put.
this mixture ginger julian scream chili 's absolute rustic now.
next , i 'm gonna lag.
some red chili powder one and a half teaspoons.
if you get the colored variety, the kashmiri variety very good one and a half tablespoon of coriander powder half teaspoon of human folder, and one four teaspoon of the turmeric, garam, masala, one teaspoon of this, and this, you need to add while you 're cooking.
OK , that 's important and then we need to add salt.
sing-along jump dance to whatever you want to do, do number summer, this is what you can do.
OK , there you go this suddenly the chicken curry starts looking good now.
the masallah, especially cook this further for three four minutes.
after you add the dry spices now, if this chick in was not farm fed like what.
probably , i remember during my childhood days.
it would never be found for chicken like what we call broiler chicken.
this would have been cooked before the tomatoes were added.
becaus the local chicken that they see chica, nasty indians call does n't get cooked easily, so as you cook.
the ginger garlic and onions.
then you need to add the check.
it , but it 's a little tough, but the pace, i tell you is amazing this one.
you can take a risk of adding later when all the spices have been added.
everything has been added.
then , you add the chicken is absolutely fine because this does n't take too much time to cope.
so what i 'm going to do is three four minutes of cooking the entire thing with the dry spices and the sort everything together see the color is absolutely.
beautiful , the chicken goes in keep cooking without the water.
in this at the chick in get cooked with the spices tomatoes, an onion, i 'm not going to add any kind of water at this point of time, let this get cooked.
maybe cover this up.
cover this up.
let it get coke will keep stirring in between in the meanwhile.
one very important thing lords of coriander is also added to this dish, so about two three tablespoons chopped coriander.
if you want to measure the quantity in tablespoons, probably three tablespoons of chopped coriander gives a nice flavored through the dish.
this is something which is very, very fragrant coriander in india.
use probably almost in everything, some dishes, we added before, while we 're cooking actually in some, we would add as a garnish on top nowadays.
yes , all chefs prefer adding a sprig of it, but in a dish like this, which is rustic.
i would certainly add this point of time, only gives a nice flavor coriander in here and at this point of time first, give us third after cooking about five minutes in the dry spices, some bottle.
so in goes the water about five hundred M L of water is what you will add to the chick in and.
now cover this up and cook the highway.
corys are generally thin, so water you can keep adjusting, i 've added five hundred M L of water force.
the chick in will also without water.
and let this get cook for at least six to eight minutes.
nicely , in the spices and then little bored of garam, masala in the last before we finish the dish after about fifteen minutes.
what you need to see is, wow look at this now.
the whole gravy looks delicious.
very important port at the chicken should be called now.
how would you come to know?
one important thing is to note that specially take the leg piece as it keeps shrinking and the entire flash gets pulled up.
then , you know, the chicken is almost cope you start seeing the bone down here this is what you see.
an you come to.
know , that 's when the chicken is called.
so now this is ready if you think it is not ready when you are cooking probably the chicken would be bigger.
so you can cook further more than fifteen minutes finally some more.
garam , masala increase defragments, i added initially, also and now once again check in is ready to serve, got a beautiful full layout very rustic.
you seem very rustic, absolutely divine the carries thin never thanked.
the onions are usually like this.
what you see here.
and it 's spicier and just garnishing it with fresh coriander, you can straight away take some bread, take some buns, get some steam rice.

and then eat.
it 's remember the highways days.
this is order tax.
