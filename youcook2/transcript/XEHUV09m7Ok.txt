hi , everyone, i 'm simon.
i 'm going to show you today how to make inside out.
roll sushi roll with some spicy tuna red pepper.
it 's a tension.
are straight our cans?
there 's nothing wrong.
it and it 's been mixed person chili paste and a little bit of mayonnaise to give it some flavor, and it goes fantastically well on inside out roll, starting with fresh sushi rice to hear layers across the middle of this seaweed, which is down on the map ready to go, move the rice evenly across the whole, the seaweed.
you do n't press too hard.
otherwise , you 'll find that it turns into something that resembles mashed potato, so move it nicely.
across cover the whole sheet nicely even accorded moving rather, than actually, pressing so you 're moving their eyes across once it 's nasoni, slayer.
i 'm just going to take some mustard seeds and sprinkle on the outside, just going to flame out a little bit of color to the outside with texture, then i take my sushi roll that 's ready to flip onto its back.
and i lay on the tuner.
it 's probably better to use a spoon initially layer and ice around here in the middle flat and out.
so that we can you will see wine a moment, using a spoon, probably keep your fingers a little bit cleaner.
although i am wearing gloves, then i 'm taking some fresh red peppers, which i 've carts.
and i 'm laying across the middle of the tuner now very carefully.
i left at one end holding the ingredients and nipping, and tucking to the end, leaving a little bit of an overlap.
so that i can have a little bit of space to close the role lift off and roll.
once last time give it a squeeze.
square it off, move the bamboo mat, and you have the roll rate to cut just could not teach and square it off, and with a very sharp japanese style knife cut the roll into the center.
one time draw knife back two sides together and do the same in the middle and on either side this way.
we 're going to get eight pieces out of the role, which is just about the right size portion, then bring on the side and let onto your serving dish, and then you can see that the packers should end up in the middle.
and that 's the lovely spicy tuna roll.
never fished there for you and delicious.
