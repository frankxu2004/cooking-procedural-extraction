hi guys, and learn battalion under this episode of flooring in kitchen before the summer runs away from us.
i figured i have to share with you, my recipe for my chicken kabobs.
i make these very often, in the hot summer months and this is really the recipe that i get for my mother, and it 's pretty much identical to the way she makes it, yeah, except i 've got one additional ingredient that i talked about in a minute you 'll need some chicken breasts this about six ounce chicken breast that i 've cut into about two inch pieces you want to show that they are relatively the same size boneless and skinless, i 'm going to limit in an orange, which is my addition, and then i 've got some rosemary and garlic salt, pepper olive oil, and just teeny, teeny, teeny tiny bit of honey i 'm gonna say banana i do n't know where i 'm gonna give any interim tiny bit of honey.
really , couple of teaspoons.
but what the honey does is carmelite.
it 's give almost like a sweet caramel, ization to the chick in.
and it balances this tart lemon width, really, really sharp, garlic marriage, mean heaven.
i 'd like to add a tiny bit of orange.
this only because if i had a meyer lemon, i would n't in fact, if you 're going to use a meyer lemon for this recipe, do n't use the orange.
but because i do n't have a meyer lemon, which is really tangerine, and the lemon, i 'm going to use a little bit of zest in a little bit of juice of the orange just to kind of make my own mixture.
i just feel like it so anyway.
let 's get started.
i got some garlic and i 've got some rosemary.
i 'm going to first of all get rid of the skins and then i 'm going to pile my rosemary leaves that rosemary is really strong.
so if you 're not a fan, i would say such do something like parsley, which is mild, or you could use time which was really well with lemon and garlic as well.
but rosemary garlic very traditional, very italian.
very what i 'm used to so, that 's what i 'm using.
i 'm going to just take.
full skin does not wanna come up there again.
i 'm going to take my resume or just going to strip the leaves right off the stem.
i do n't want to stand the stem is really tough.
however , when i was a child and rosemary grows in italy like you would n't believe like on side of road the rosemary stalks are super thick.
and they were super long that my grandma my and my mom would have them on hand, they will use the stock as the actual piece that as you actual skewer for your kebabs.
so that you 've got that flavor as it 's amazing unfortunately this little ring thing is going to work for me really sort of sturdy pieces of rosemary do that is, fantastic i 'm going to take these and i 'm just going to give everything a really good chop altogether that looks really, really good.
i 'm going to grill these indoor today on.
because it 's not very good weather and.
therefore it would look really dark and cloudy if we were outside.
but if you are doing this outside fantastic.
now bring this closer to me.
a little bit of orange that 's not a whole lot, because remember we 're trying to get a familiar taste from meyer lemons.
so little bit of orange lot of lemon.
it really kind of you 're making your own concoction, natalia meyer lemons for unbelievable and i just get.
so angry that my supermarket does n't carry them, i mean, come on all right.
that 's good enough.
and i want to put teach you much, and then i 'm just going to squeeze a little bit of lemon juice and orange juice, probably half of an orange in half of a lemon that 's good, it 's going to get a little my team alright.
let 's salt and pepper.
this really, well, and the like my, i 'm done is i 've taken my pepper mill grinder whatever it 's called that.
i 've just changed a setting.
so my black pepper is been, more course.
and i 've been really digging it and even know you could do that.
but apparently you learn something new, everyday respect little bit of olive oil not too much, just a couple of tablespoons will do the trick memories are coming out super slow.
and just a small amount of money that is , it.
i was that like a teaspoon and a half that will make a difference just trust me on this and give everything a really good stir and then, i 'm going to cover this and pop it in the fridge for a half hour or so, maybe a little bit more and a honey also really helps thicken the juices like those the lemon juice and the orange juice and.
therefore really quotes to chicken well, which.
so the thing start really well commented classic rap and in the fridge it goes.
and then it will be time should grow these up, my chicken was in the fridge for about forty five minutes.
you want to make sure you do n't want to go too long.
otherwise , the lemon juice is actually gonna start cooking the chick in it.
will break it down the ass is going to break it down?
and you do n't want that.
so forty five minutes, we 're going to trick.
i took it out of the fridge about five minutes ago, because i do n't want to put something super, super cool chicken on a hot grill pan.
it 's going to seize up and become really tough.
now i have here is some red onion.
it 's cut the same size as the chick in now right now.
it is something else.
my mother always, always, always has on her kabobs or, kabobs, or, spiedini, or brochettes however you call them times also like to add zucchini and peppers.
but since i 'm making a roasted vegetable and spaghetti with dinner up to go along with this i 'm not going to add them here.
but you can absolutely for my skewers.
i always like to use like the middle ones to reasons.
one i always have them on hand.
because i watched him from the back of my door, two, when you 're cooking kebabs and you cook him on a metal skewer the heat is actually going to hit the metal and it 's going to cook the chicken from the inside out.
so it 's actually doing two things it 's helping you cook the chicken faster and more evenly, and it 's also you clean it 's finally, it 's good to go there you go.
now you can do this and whatever particular way you want i always start with a couple pieces of onion i do n't go all the way i leave about two inches here, then you take a couple pieces of chicken , energean.
see they 're all about the same size and depending on how many pieces of chicken you put on your skewer.
you 're going to get more or less, kabobs.
so with that, and then some more onion.
and then just a couple, more pieces of chicken and then finish it which finish it off with the onion that 's how i do it anyway, you have to do it that way.
but it 's just what works really well for me.
and that 's how i 've always done it.
so if it ai n't broke, do n't fix it, got all my chick in.
i 've got about fix out of my mixture, which is about right.
usually , get about six out of them if again, if i would put in less chicken on you get, probably eight.
but then this is the skewer and then back this much of chicken on it anyways i 've got my group hamper heating, i have over about medium heat.
i do n't want to put too high because it will develop too much color before the chicken gets a chance to cook so medium heat.
usually works, works perfect for me.
but still, just a little tiny bit of olive oil on it just.
so that nothing kind of steaks and develop color that i 'm just going to take each one and get on there alright i 'm going to let these cook for about two to three minutes on all four , sizes.
i 'm going to sternum from each side until they 're all evenly colored an.
it 's cooked all the way through.
i will show you what they look like when they 're done.
just make sure you keep an eye on the heat.
you want it to be in medium you want to be too high.
actually just turn mine down a little bit, so it 's in between medium and medium low.
it 's done develop colors, but you just want to make sure that it all goes get cooked really well, so let the phone.
i 'll show you.
what they look like when they 're done.
michael bombs were on the grill for about three minutes on all four sides.
so it 'll take about twelve minutes for the whole batch.
if you have to make sure you get your heat on the perfect setting my name is medium, it 's gorgeous color did not burn.
i 'm trying that honey definitely does add a little something to the coding.
the lemon rosemary, the garlic there absolutely delicious make sure, let them cool babe before you handle them because the metal skewers will be super duper hot.
we can do the same recipe missing pieces of pork, using seafood.
obviously , the time the cooking time will bury i am just buying time with me, guys i do n't know where to lower indications are coming up, this recipe.
flame lehman works really well, as well in this recipe, everyone joy spending time with me.
ask next time.
