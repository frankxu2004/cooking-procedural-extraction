chairman to show you how to cook a piece of wagra first.
i want to get a pan hot.
i have a little piece of flaw here about an ounce and you do n't need to add any factor, your pan.
but you do want it to be quite hot and season.
it , with salt and pepper and just put it right in there, and all that fat is going to come out and it 's going to smoke a little bit you might want to open up a window.
so you do n't have to add any fat to the pan because fogger is basically pure fat.
it 's going to let out a whole lot of it.
people say they like to put butter same with flaw.
i do n't like to do that.
yes all alone so you wanna do is.
karma lies it on the first side, and then flip it, and all.
you gotta, do is cook it until it is warm in the center?
you do n't want to give anyone an undercooked piece of farmer.
so now i 'm going to get a piece of toast.
my , kroger is just about there a let.
it sit in the pain for a minute, and then it 's ready to eat, and that 's how you see your piece of barbara.
