all right guys, you know, those potatoes he get on the side of your eggs when you order them at a restaurant there.
really greasy really salty, but they do taste good.
i 'm going to try to replicate that recipe today with a healthier version cigarette.
all right guys monkey belittling TV on your house break after what this absolute bread.
cookbook i 'm trying to replicate a recipe that you sit in the restaurant potatoes that are deep fried.
they 're really greasy.
the really salty.
but the case good, i 'm going to try to replicate that on today 's episode of browse cookbook, all you need are some sweet potatoes were going to die cinema from cubes about a third cup of diced onion.
third cup of red pepper and a little bit of olive oil.
and that 's it paris.
recipe up with some eggs in the morning will have a full muscle building recipe, so let 's get started.
so i 'm going to over medium heat.
once again keep the temperature low.
because we are using all of all, you do n't want to cook all of oil over too high of heat.
two teaspoons of olive oil to coat the pen, well, it actually got them ready.
add the other ingredients.
so come on over connector pan.
it 's been heated over medium heat.
add in the onions and less sought eighties for about two minutes, get them soft then will head in the other ingredients.
now that the onions are nice and sauteed and smelling delicious.
let 's add in our red pepper, and then we 'll add in our sweet potatoes.
and then about a tablespoon of water that we 're going to cover it for about fifteen minutes and allow that to cook.
so we 're hoping for that fifteen minutes is that these sweet potatoes become soft and ready to eat.
but do n't just walk away for fifteen minutes.
you want to make sure that you 're turning this sweet potato so they do n't burn on one side.
so just keep flipping them every once in awhile are there done.
and it actually took much shorter than what i thought it took about eight or nine minutes depending on how soft you like sweet potatoes, final touch will add some pepper on top.
what do you think?
and there we have it, i guess you can call it sweet potato hash or just sweet potatoes.
whatever you want to call, it smells delicious.
and it looks pretty cool at this, as a side dish to any protein source.
so with steak chick in or having the morning with your eggs and you 're good to go, and the final things do is always take a taste, have some soup?
