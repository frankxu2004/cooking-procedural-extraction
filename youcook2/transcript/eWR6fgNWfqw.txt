hi , chef, to call back here on C T bites.
happy knew year, you know, the weather is getting colder all cooking more.
i have a delicious, rest them and show you today for turkey asian pot stickers, you can even make these vegetarian by simply leaving out the turkey meat.
so we 're going to start with a large nonstick pan.
we 've got two cubes of frozen ginger in.
here , you know, how much i love those frozen herbs.
and we 're going to put in some turkey meat now a little goes a long way.
this may not look like much remember to plus stickers are really small.
and they do n't really spelling so we have some turkey.
we have some shredded paris, which are great, you know, me.
i 'm always trying to get extra vegetables into my kids.
and then we have some cult, like of course, cut your own cabbage.
but why bother by this stuff.
this is great.
this is really where the bulk of the filling comes in.
so , of course, you 're getting lots of vegetables, which i love.
and then we 're going to add in some bamboo shoots, which are also is that they have lots of fiber in them, which was really nice.
so let 's put some of those, and.
now we 're going to process all of this in a little , please.
in art, so it 's not like big chunks.
now we 're going to go with.
i just turned it around, and all this is coming to you.
add your flavor and then there 's like a little bit of rice wine vinegar, you do n't need much always keep your finger over the top.
so you do n't make a big mess of what you doing little rice wine vinegar, a little poison sauce twice the sauce, is delicious nicely flavored sauce using a lot of chinese cooking and again, you know, with my follicles, he can really wing it, it 's a couple tablespoons in a little bit of soy sauce.
you have to have a top on it, so you only have to put your finger over it.
and then our final thing at a little bit of sleet, or some people put sugar out a little bit of sweet and sour sauce.
really gives a nice kind of a sweet tangy flavor to the filling of this, and then are you going to do is just let this cook down for that.
seven minutes get the heat going nice and high.
just break this up as much as you can remember.
we are going to process this in the cuisinart.
so we 're going to cook this until it 's completely cooked through.
so it 's been about six or seven minutes, and you can see, are delicious turkey pot sticker filling is done?
you want to make sure that most of liquid has evaporated because you definitely do not want wet and yucky on the inside of your plastic are.
now do you want to do.
is put these in.
cuisinart food processor.
here just want to pulse this really quickly, so this is all then we 're going to put a uncooked scallions or green onions through those.
and i just actually found out that you can freeze your leftover chops kind.
i wanna, go do that today when i get home want to make sure before you do your pot stickers that you just place the filling just finally chop it up.
it just prior formal pulses now look on the inside here you see how it 's chopped, but not completely machine.
now this is going to come.
are feeling i 'm going to show you how we 're going to actually make the pot.
stickers , stickers are already put together.
this is actually a really great thing to do with your kids on the, we can just make sure you got plenty of time to do it.
now you can buy these rappers in one of two ways you can either buy them as egg roll wrappers.
and they come like right by your produce section of your supermarket, or you can buy them as won ton wrappers, and if you can find the won ton wrapper simply cut the egg roll wrappers in half.
now this is important.
you some water.
he was going to basically paint the edges with your finger, you can use a brush, but of course, your hands are your best tools.
and all you do is you just fold it over like this now.
here 's the only important part.
fill it up too much.
and be make sure these are really pushed together well.
just like that pretty easy to do my kids love to do this 'cause they can make all sorts of funky shapes.
they make what they call packages.
so we 're going to do one more they, just.
so i can show you, and the other thing that 's really great about this feeling as you can also make egg rolls, which is really cool.
so will do one more one time.
all you do is put the filling in the middle again.
you do n't need much, and then you simply fold this over like this.
and it makes almost instant little pot stickers.
now , egg rolls almost the same thing.
you just take a whole wrapper like this now.
the only trick is you want to put these sort of angle and you can put a little more now.
this goes right in the middle just like this and the way that i taught my kids to remember how to do these was.
i said you touched the baby in, and then you roll 'em up and look at that you got gorgeous really easy to make turkey egg rolls, and.
now we 're going to fry him up and will be ready to go.
so we have about three quarters of a cup of hot vegetable or peanut oil do not want to use.
it , it 'll get to fix your cooking.
we 're going to pan fry, these out remember these are going to pop too badly because there 's no water.
these are pretty dry and he 's only take about thirty seconds per side.
you see, if you had this one is about thirty seconds are n't is gorgeous.
and then all i need to do is make a little dipping sauce over here.
which is simply soy sauce rice wine, vinegar and a tiny pincher, sugars to cut some of the city you can do a little bit.
so pressing BCS on top for garnish.
OK , just like in our house somebody was going to turn these over and just serve 'em up and then if you want you can also kind of dry, these off on some oil and will just serve these up these PA stickers there gorgeous you want to make sure your oils really hot, hot, hot , hot.
that way it ought to stay in the oil for too long and very quickly before you play him up.
