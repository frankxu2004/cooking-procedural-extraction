hello , this is shut down from food wishes, dot com, with an unbelievably incredibly great onion ring recipe.
these are the most incredible onion rings.
ever , you know, i 'm normally, pretty modest and humble it 's one of the things that makes me so awesome.
but i have to say these are incredible best in the world alright.
so we 're going to start with some regular flour and cornstarch.
so it 's kind of similar to a tempura batter basically.
but there 's my secret ingredient instant.
mashed potatoes alright little kayan, so i 'm going to whisk up the dry ingredients.
and then i 'm going to add club.
soda , you have to get the exact amounts on food wishes were going to stir that in which is just going to take a minute by the way, do n't worry bout developing gluten or the batter is going to be tough?
this is unbelievable.
now looks pretty thin there.
but as it 's, it 's the instant mashed potato, even though it 's just a little bit is going to swell up and absorb some of that liquid is going to be perfect.
we 're going to put some panko bread crumbs the other secret oil pan you can get those in any stores, stop emailing me.
you ca n't find panko you can big supermarkets habit alright.
i like to use not super big, but kind of medium.
yellow onions do not cut him any thicker than a quarter inch.
otherwise , they wo n't cook separatum into rings.
i did n't really need to tell you that right alright, so there we go this is only like ten minutes later, our batter has thickened slightly.
and it 's perfect.
we 're going to dump in a few rings at a time make sure they get coated with the batter, which is pretty much going to drip off.
but enough is going to stick on there to latch on to these panko bread crumbs these sharp incredibly crispy bread crumbs.
by the way, do as i say, not as you just saw, me do use a separate fork for the crumbs and a separate fork to pull him out of the batter much easier , right.
we 're going to fridays, and i 'm not doing a deep fry demo just standard three fifty, i 'm using olive oil standard vegetable oil frying oil is going to work going to go maybe three two and a half three minutes, and when it comes out that magic formula that i 've come up with, with the potato and the panko, produces the most chris pierce onion ring i 've ever had ever anywhere right now, you can hear this that 's not fake sounds that is the actual crunchiness and now, you just have to listen to this unbelievable, that was really blanca, there was no salt make sure you solve these generously before serving with some very fine sea salt.
so it sticks on there and let me finish this i know this is.
so rude but come on admit it, you want to hear it and that 's it super crispy amazing onion rings, and here is really the ultimate test lots of different recipes are crunchy.
right when they come out.
do it, the real test does it stay crunchy, what you 're going to see in here.
now is literally to the second fifteen minutes later, these sat on this rack for fifteen minutes, and this is what they sound like your honor.
i rest my case anyway.
hope you give it a try, go to this site all the ingredients.
are there an as always enjoy?
