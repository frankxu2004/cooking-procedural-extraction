we 're making some falafels, my favorite things learn it.
and we 're going to add some tahini sauce to go on top of them in these things are bomb, i mean, superbomb management bomb.
but the best thing is there paillier.
therefore , our body in this order chef the little thing.
there any freaking diet you have you can treat these mother fuckers.
so let 's go there super easy OK, we 're going to have three tablespoons of olive oil, a half a teaspoon of sea salt, a sick of cinnamon two and a half cups of chickpeas.
these need to be soaked in water the night before you 're going to end up with two and a half.
so start with about one and one fourths tried.
and it 's going to become half soaked.
do n't use canned beans against?
do n't you scan been not only.
because we hate aluminum.
but more importantly, they do n't cook right.
because we 're actually using only a soap raw chickpea, not a cook chickpea again not equipped then we 're going to use about a half a cup of cilantro, a half a cup of parsley, and we might squeeze in a little lemon juice to these two.
but mainly lemon juice for the tahini sauce, which has about map of tahini lemon juice and a little bit of water OK, we 're going to throw everything in the blender for the falafel sensor on your herbs and your garbanzos?
a little shake of cinnamon.
your salt, your olive oil.
OK , we 're gonna wiz bees, oh, we 're going to have garlic in here.
i totally forgot garlic.
you want about three clothes of garlic and makes these teeth super yummy.
i know you probably notice that i 'm cutting in my hand.
and this is the normal thing for me because i used to live in a tree.
believe it or not so do not clap your hands.
i learned this while living in the tree, not living a normal life.
yeah , i used to live in a tree, a big one really big one is super big.
one thirty year, old big one and we did n't have cutting boards so.
hey , here we go start in there.
now we 're going to food process just until it 's mixed up.
OK , once it 's super mix, stuff and looking like there 's tons of herbs in it 'cause we love herbs.
so just roll these in the balls in place on.
i cleaned them.
we 're going to bake a man, not fry them.
which is why these are super duper healthy.
i like to bake mine in a cast iron pan.
but you can put them on a baking sheet or anything.
you want i like to make balls if you want to make patties and just flatten them out.
so just throw all these in here, you 're going to have the oven at about four twenty five.
you could come for about twenty to twenty five minutes.
but they 're still kind of soft on the inside.
so like i said, throw these in the oven for twenty five minutes at four hundred twenty five degrees.
we already have some made right here that we 're going to make our tahini sauce with and put it on top.
so take your tahini pour in a little water, an ad squeezing some lemon.
get it all in there.
and , then shake a little salt in there, then we 're going to whisk these up, so just kind of keep starring this.
you want it to be a smooth in kind of creamy consistency.
but liquidy enough that you can pour it on kind of like a salad dressing.
now that you 've got it the consistency.
you want you can put on your falafels.
i love making full waffle salads.
'cause there 's super yummy, so, just pour everything as much as you want do n't maybe for the whole thing less you want it to support all over their yum, yum and then give it a taste waffles, and tahini sauce, oh, yeah, super password serbs super delicious.
