today , we 're going to make some fried calamari.
we 're gonna need a pan of calamari if you want the tentacles also or just.
commonly , a teaspoon of black pepper teaspoon of seasoning this is, uh, have thought?
if you are in the US, you can get the, oh, yeah, which is good about two cups of oil, two cups of flour went to serve it.
we 're going to need a little some lemons and tabasco sauce, which is good, but you can use tartar source or any source.
you like for seafood, so let 's get started.
so for our flower, we 're going to make the seasoning and the pepper.
we 're going to put it in the flower, and we 're going to mix it together, until these were combined.
and after that we 're going to cut the paula money in about quarter inch or half centimeter thick dick like this, you just need a sharp knife and that 's it.
so you gonna cut them just like this very easy in for the tentacles were not going to do nothing to them.
be cause they already came.
clean , and everything and package.
so this, they 're going to stay like this is so another you have cut the calamari.
i have already the flower ready.
so try to keep the karamatic sweat and which is gonna drop them in the flower and just cover them with flower as much as you can.
and after that after you see there all covered from both sides here and here just gonna take them out of the flower trying to take the access out we 're going to put.
them , in a platter for about five minutes, we do n't need much.
be cause if you fry them right now the flower is going to get out of there in there not going to fight.
very , well, so just wait five to ten minutes and then we 're going to hit the oil for the tentacles.
very easy just take one, and the same thing cover it with flower.
in after that after is well covered just take up the axis so it 's been about ten minutes.
another , if you can tell the flower, it does n't look like dry, it 's becoming to get wet, so this is what we want now.
we 're going to start to heat the oil.
we 're going to need a temperature of one hundred and eighty celsius or three sixty fire height in this is a very hard temperature.
so keep in mind that use your biggest flame so that you can get this temperature.
now , they oil has got the temperature of three sixty fahrenheit.
this is before the, the oils, it starts to get like smoke.
so it 's a little bit before that.
so if you got the smoke like i am right.
now just lower the temperature and taking away for maybe like twenty seconds and, the temperature is going to drop this is just to show you if you do n't have a thermometer.
but so now that we got the temperature we 're going to start vitamin frying them for one minute.
maybe minute and a half because if you go over that they will become like rubber just go little by little, do n't put too much?
when , when you see there, like this color, just take them out there.
these are ready just keep the heat on high so that you can keep the temperature.
and i 'm going to keep trying until i finish all of them every time you take some kalamaris out, wait maybe like one minute.
so that the temperature goes up again.
the heat is some high still always on high is making sure the temperature is high now.
it 's been like one minute.
we 're gonna start, pulling some more in there OK guys.
so here in a big better, we have play some lettuce leaves a little bit of tabasco sauce.
and , of course, the calamari rings and this is the final dish is very good.
