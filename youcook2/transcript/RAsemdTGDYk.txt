today , i 'm going to be making some really, really easy scrambled eggs.
i 've got four eggs.
four tablespoons of water that 's at room temperature, an one tablespoon of vegetable oil three ingredients.
let 's get started.
first thing we 're going to do.
get all of our four eggs into a bowl.
i 'm just going to start whisking those around this is a really, really simple recipe, and.
now my four tablespoons of water.
so that 's one tablespoon of water per egg.
now you can use milk if you wish however you know, there 's a lot of debate, but in most hotels, restaurants, the chefs, will use water?
most chefs believed in water over milk, but at home, you want a little bit more nutrition.
throw in the milk will just mix that up.
i want that really, well whiskey.
and then we 're ready to get our pan heated up and get on to the next step alright.
and i 've set up my hot plate here.
first thing get her oil in there, you can just mix that around a little bit, you do n't want your heat too high and then i 'm going to grab all of my egg.
i 'm just going to give it a little last minute whisk and get that right in there just like that, and then what i 'm going to do is right away.
i 'm going to start pushing the egg if we leave the egg in there and do n't move it.
we 're going to turn this into an omelet, so i 'm going to just keep moving my egg just like this.
i 'm actually going to lower my heat.
and then you just want to push it now.
you do not want to have a really high heat because what will happen is your egg will actually start browning now.
if you like, you know, a little bit of a crust on your egg, that 's fine.
however , i like my egg without that kind of crust.
and so you want to do a low heat, just like that, you can see how quickly this is coming together just before i started filming.
i did make my toast mitos is already to go.
you can see in real time.
how quickly this comes together, and the longer you let this sit here.
the more moisture is driven out of the eggs and the dryer they will become and at this point right here, you can see where maybe fifteen twenty seconds away from plating and right there were almost done.
so , let 's play this up.
turn this element right off.
i 'll go get my plate alright.
i 'm just zoomed in a little bit.
here 's our beautiful leg.
will get that right on their beautiful scrambled egg platter?
oh , that looks good.
that 's good just like that.
we get our toast on there as well, hit that with a little pepper little bit of salt and there.
we go my easy scrambled eggs.
i hope you enjoy this video and i 'll see you next time.
