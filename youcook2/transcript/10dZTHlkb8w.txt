hi guys, and lerma tally, on this, a positive war in the kitchen i want to show you what i like to call my italian BLT, panini.
now it 's got the traditional elements of a BLT.
but it is going to be fantastic.
it 's easy and let me show you the ingredients so we can get started.
you 're going to need some fresh spinach, some beautiful tomatoes, and fresh basil.
some punch it that it 's been thinly sliced.
some pesto, your choice of shred it from alone, you can use mozzarella.
you can use whatever you have on hand.
but it just.
so happens that from me, i love using punch cards instead of bacon, which is more traditional for BLT and instead of using say iceberg lettuce or any kind of lettuce.
i see, you finish.
because got lots and lots of great flavor and it 's really good for us and, of course going to have some beautiful tomatoes to go along with it.
so what i 'm going to do is make everything on grill pan you want to get your group in nice and hot over, over medium high heat and what i 'm actually going to do.
and this might sound a little bit odd, my family 's life uncheck that i 'm just going to grill it for a couple minutes on each side to develop its flavor in a little bit of texture and that 's.
what i 'm going to do for now.
and it 's going to take no time at all, it takes just about a minute per side, but go ahead and do that.
take my last two pieces on, and it literally takes just about a minute or so total.
it does n't take anytime at all.
but i really developed the flavor.
so it 's a really important step that i would n't skip.
but of course, if you do n't have fun check, that which is really the italian version of bacon, then you can just use bacon.
so on to assembling our sandwiches now.
what i do is take couple sizes of good quality bread.
and i 'd like to use a whole grain bread because i always have whole grain on hand that 's my bright of choice in.
i 'd like to spread a thin, thin slice, but i have to one teaspoon per slice of pesto.
i am using pastor was because traditionally we use mayo, but hotmail gotta figure friendly.
and i 'm not a huge fan of may on my sandwiches.
but if you like mayor, then by all means knock yourself out.
what i 'm going to do is just spreading thin slant smear of basil pesto onto each slice.
the last one OK.
now here 's how she goes, i 'm going to put a little bit of the shredded cheese, underneath pretty much everything.
so first slice is going to be a little bit of cheese and this is one of the top or.
so do n't worry bout.
those two slices just yet and the reason, i 'm putting cheese on the first slice N, as well as the top it 's.
because it 's going to act like glue, and it 's going to kind of stick everything together.
so that 's, that 's why i 'm using it that way then going to pile on the tomatoes you can just to use whatever you want just seizing the tomatoes a little bit, with some pepper you do not need any salt.
because pancetta is.
so salty it will be.
so overpowering and, then you 'll be completely regretting, that move.
so just pile on your punch it down it 's.
so thinly sliced it 's going to be amazing.
i do n't like to have like two thick of a piece of bacon or pancetta in my mouth 'cause i think it 's two overpowering to just nothing you can just anything else if you do that a couple slices of bacon, bacon of basil and then i 'm just going to put on a handful of some fresh clean baby spinach that 's great.
so last thing whoops losing my, my spinach last thing i wanna do is put a little bit more cheese on top.
because this is a top player.
so it 's like remember it 's like glue, you need something to hold it all together that 's fabulous.
so now i 'm just going to put a light drizzle of olive oil my grill pan.
so nothing sticks for the topper on i 'm going to just put them right on here and those are going to be on for a few minutes on each side or until the cheese melts just flip it once, and you 're done he 's look great, given on the grill for just about three minutes per side just until the cheese melts it, i 'm actually going to bring this over to my board.
so i can cut it just like that oh, yeah, look at that oh, i 'm excited for this, that is, awesome it is.
so incredible, delicious that punch at dumb just listen to me given your kitchen make this sandwich.
because i guarantee it once you do you 'll never make plain old biltis ever again i have been training time with me to get this recipe and others could WWW dot or any kitchen dot com, nothing.
next time, bye, bye call perhaps.
