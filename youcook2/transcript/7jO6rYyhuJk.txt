hi , everybody, and welcome back to cooking here today in this episode we 're making up a fast and easy grilled cheese sandwich.
now you might say to yourself, all making.
them is so easy which it is, but there is a little technique that will allow you to make them so much easier.
so , let 's get started to get started here.
we 're going to add about a tablespoon of butter to the pan.
i 'm using my funky egg roll pan simply because i like the grill marks a lot of people have asked where they can get these.
and you can get them from our amazon store.
i 'll put a link below now that are butter is nicely melted down.
i 'm going to turn the heat back to medium, low, and place the first place of rating.
now what i 'm going to do is lay the cheddar cheese over the top.
you can use sliced or grated.
if you want, of course, i 'm going to use just enough cheese to cover the bread, then will place the top layer of bread on.
and i 'm going to give this a little press down, and we 're going to let this cook for about three minutes.
after three minutes, i 'm going to add another half a tablespoon of butter to the pan.
we 'll flip the grilled cheese over and allow it to cook for an additional three minutes.
it 's interesting because i do n't know how many times in the past.
i 've struggled with trying to spread the butter over the bread and ripping the break it up.
this method is.
so much easier after three minutes, we 're going to remove the grilled cheese from the pan and look at that perfectly done and beautiful grill marks.
so i 'm just going to give this a slice diagonally with my knife.
and you 're ready to serve and there you have.
it are simple, easy and perfect, grilled cheese sandwich, so that was our grilled cheese sandwich i hope.
