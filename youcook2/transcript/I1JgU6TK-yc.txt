by show of hands who here loves caesar salad me, i love it.
i order it all the time when i go out to restaurants and, you know, sometimes it 's great, and sometimes it 's not so great today.
i 'm making a version.
that 's a little bit lower fact, and it 's a chicken caesar which is a perennial favorite, i think first what you do is you marinate your chick in, and you make the base for your dressing.
so it 's sort of two for one, one and a half cups of buttermilk with two tablespoons of lemon juice marinate for as little as fifteen minutes.
but you can make this ahead of time.
if you want to up to a day two tablespoons of lemon juice, one clove of garlic today.
i 'm using a garlic press.
i like the small size that you get with the garlic press here.
classic caesar salads, are actually made by mashing garlic with anchovies and then whisking in egg yolk and olive oil?
i 'm replacing my egg, yolk, with mayonnaise, and i 'm leaving out the anchovy, but please feel free to add it in.
if you want to a quarter cup of grated parmesan cheese.
this is cheese is going to go into the marinade.
but it 's also going into the dressing salt and pepper and then reserve a half a cup of this mixture to make your dressing later.
the rest of it.
you want to pour over three skinless, boneless chicken breasts about six to eight ounces.
each seal it up, refrigerate it if you 're going to marinate this longer than fifteen minutes.
but if you wanted to do it for his level, is fifteen you totally quit for the croutons today?
i 'm using a multigrain bread.
it 's a little unorthodox.
i guess, but it 's a little bit healthier.
you certainly could use regular bread.
if you wanted to like a chewy, rustic bread would work as well brush two slices of multigrain bread with olive oil have your broiler, preheating these croutons are going to be broiled.
little bit of salt and then just broil them until they are golden brown.
and then you 'll cut them up afterwards when you 're ready to make your salad take your chicken out of the marinade, letting the excess drip back into the bag and place it on a rimmed baking sheet that 's been lined with foil.
so let the excess liquid rip-off.
but some of it 's going to end up on the pan, and that will get a little extra caramel, ised burnt in the oven, which is why you want to put it on this rimmed baking sheet with the foil.
have your brother.
preheating , and then cook it until your chicken is cooked through.
should take about thirteen fifteen minutes and you can make your dressing?
this is a quarter cup of light mayonnaise.
you can use regular manase if you want to, to that, add your reserved buttermilk, marinade.
that 's why there was the cheese in their caesar.
sell it always has cheese delicious.
we 're not using all that much, but you can feel free to add more if you want to caesar salad, always has romaine today.
i 'm combining my romaine lettuce with some ready keio, though.
for a little bit of color, two heads of romain cut into pieces and a half ahead for detail.
that 's also been shredded, you can toss everything together in the bowl that you made your dressing.
romaine , riddick, EO, i told you it was n't a conventional caesar salad.
i was n't kidding, sort of a cross between caesar salad and ranch the buttermilk instead of the mayonnaise base set that aside for sack, cut up your chick in gotten just a little bit of golden brown and those extra round spots or broiled cheese to add extra deliciousness user cook, just until they 're cooked through.
so the chicken is n't dry chicken can go into the salad with your ready go chicken goes in you want to toss everything together i find that tossing my salad with the dressing 's makes for a much better eating experience than drizzling over the top unless saying the croutons cut the bread into whatever size croutons you, like, say i do n't know about an inch tossed your croutons into your salad very hearty fantastic serve it up in a nice big bowl it 's a hardier kinda healthier kind of lighter version of chicken caesar salad that i 'm sure everybody is going to love hi guys thanks for watching this video be sure to click here if you want to subscribe and click over here if you want to continue watching more great videos like this.
