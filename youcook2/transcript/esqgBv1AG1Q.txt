so we 're going to begin by adding boiling water to a pound of wholemeal flour and then stir the mixture together add a pinch of salt and then knead.
the dough if the door feels, dry, add some water and finally add some oil OK the door is.
now smooth and elastic, and is ready to be rolled out.
so i 'm going to make small balls.
so it will take a bit of dog like this, squeeze it in my hands and then roll it out into a smooth ball, like this imperative.
the piece of dough into some flower and then place it on the chokey, so you start rolling it out.
and you must make sure you pull it out even the whole sides and forward nice circle.
OK , one thirty is six inches wide and two millimeters thick.
we 're not going to add the roti onto the hot pan, you will begin to see brown specks appearing on the other side of routine.
so i turn this over like this, not yet.
but OK, so i 'll turn out even.
now and you can see the brown specks completely log level and open all year.
round , it 's going to be hot pad because otherwise the raji would rise.
you see, in a bit, OK and never turns over so you see this brown specks now push down the sides.
and you see the rookie rising to be deeply there for that, that is almost cooked right.
so that is done.
look at that was a beautifully.
now is a freshly cooked, naughty look at that, and that could be put into the plane like this the reason why it roses so.
so much be cause earlier added, a good job in need in the door my goodness it smells delicious another showing, you how easy, it is to make.
i 'm sure you 'll give this a try to thank you.
