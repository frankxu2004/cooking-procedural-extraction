hey , everybody welcome to the wharf pier today, i 'm doing the fourth video on my fourth of july video series, how to cook the perfect shish, kabob.
so , let 's get started to start with a three and a half pound.
top sirloin roast and i 'm going to remove most of the fat, and then cut this up into bite size.
pieces about this size you do n't want the pieces to be too small.
or they 'll dry out or too big for obvious reasons, after trimming and cutting off the roads, we have about three pounds of me now.
i 'm going to pour a whole bottle of zesty italian, dressing over it.
one teaspoon of italian seasoning and one teaspoon each with salt and pepper.
now i 'm going to give this a good thorough mix with my hands.
and then we 're going to cover it and put it in the refrigerator for about an hour.
you do n't believe the meat in the italian dressing much longer than an hour due to acid in.
it will actually begin to cook the meat, and it will be mushy when you eat it now.
i 'm not going to bore you.
so i 'm going to put one skewer together, you can put these together.
anyway , you, like i 'd like to start off with a piece of meat and then an onion i do n't like the marinate the vegetables.
so i just let them marinate off the meat marinate the vegetables that 's enough marinade for the vegetables for maine and plus too much marinade is going to cause your vegetables to burn and again build the skewers how you like the dem use.
whatever kind of fruits and vegetables do you like.
now just continue building skewers until you have the number.
you need now what these sit out for about twenty minutes, like i said, before, you do n't.
wanna grill cold me.
have the grill do n't preheated to four hundred and fifty degrees?
and we 're going to grow these over direct heat.
now i 'm going to close the lid and let these cook for about four and a half to five minutes per side now.
we 're at the five minute mark.
so i 'm going to go ahead and give these turn after cooking for a total of ten minutes or shish, kabobs are done and there you have it, tender and juicy marinated, shish , kabobs.
thank you guys very much watching.
i hope you stay tuned for the rest of the fourth of july video series.
i hope you give this a try and i 'll see you next time.
