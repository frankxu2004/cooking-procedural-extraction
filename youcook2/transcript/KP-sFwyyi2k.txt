this is how i drive the tofu, tofu has a lot of moisture, and it wo n't brown correctly if it 's.
so moist, then place another plate on top and put a big bowl of water on top of that, you can use a big frying pan if you want or if you have a walk, you can use it.
the walk is very hot.
i 'm holding my hand over it and i can feel the heat.
you do, is this simply put some oil into the bottom of the walk, the oil is now very, very hot.
so be very careful with the next step.
you can see that, that oakwood, splattering that 's good just give it a minute and it 's going to turn.
and i 'm going to put it in the helper.
so the objective here is to flatten out the team page and get it to melt into the oil as you can see.
is turning oil a beautiful red shade?
now we 're going to add the salted black beans so they are these beans are made by pressing them into salles just add them directly into the tofu.
these are dried chili flakes, and they 're very spicy.
just give a little sprinkle does n't that look good.
this is regular soccer that i would drink.
but for it in let 's add a little vinegar very bad now let 's add a little soy sauce.
now we 're going to put into small dried, sichuan style chili 's you can put these in with the oil if you like.
i just forgot, well, add the ginger paste now and let 's top it off with the green onion tops.
you want a six gravy with vegetables and chili 's all in it, it has a fermented smell, an assault, you smell you can add chili paste now, if you like it, or you can add fresh chili 's trying to turn off the heat and transfer this to a plate.
let 's see, what it looks like on the plate.
OK , it 's all done this is my mapo tofu as you can see.
there is still lots of whole pieces of tofu, but some half broken from the broken one.
you can see that the sauce has nicely coated the outside, leaving a very white interior.
there are black beans green onions and chilies all in this tofu.
it looks so good.
even my dog wants some OK.
i hope you make this at home.
it 's very easy, authentic and delicious enjoy it.
