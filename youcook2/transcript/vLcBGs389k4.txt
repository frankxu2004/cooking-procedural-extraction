hey everybody thomas, joseph here with another kitchen conundrum, well, not technically a kitchen conundrum.
i 'm going to show you one of the things that 's really close to me.
and , that is buffalo chicken wings because i am from buffalo.
so i 'm going to show you that buffalo chicken wings are really easy to make at home, and you do n't need to spend the money going out and buying them for the game day to start.
i have a large dutch oven here filled with about four inches.
so , that is like a safflower oil or canola oil.
any vegetable oil something that can go up to a high, high heat into the spot i 'm going to add a wire rack.
now this is one of my favorite tricks.
here , whenever i 'm deep frying, pudding a rack in the bottom of the pot.
what that does, is it helps to fry things?
nice and evenly just using tongs to help yourself out there.
so what that wire rack does, is it helps to lift the food off the bottom of the pan.
so you get really nicely evenly cooked food without any brown thoughts from hitting the bottom.
i 'm going to use a deep fat thermometer here.
this is a candy thermometer and i need to keep the oil up to about four hundred degrees.
and now while this oil comes up to heat i 'm going to show you how to cut the wings into the appropriate size pieces.
this is what you 're going to get your supermarket.
this is a chicken wing here.
and i 'm going to separate it into three parts.
the first part here is the drum at an all you have to do is.
look for the joint of the chicken wing cut through the skin.
bend it a little bit.
pop out the joint should pop out right there.
and now, you know, where to cut, so this is the drum at.
and , so this portion believe it.
or not is called the wing.
at you want to do the same thing here where you take the wing tip which is this portion.
you break the joint and then you should be able to cut cleanly through we 're not going to fry up this wingtip here place this in a resealable plastic bag in your freezer, and you 'll have this for whenever you need to make chicken stock.
and here you go your wing at.
so oil is almost up to temperature the wings take a piece of paper towel here and gently dab off any excess moisture.
because if you have excess moisture on your chicken wings once you place them in the hot oil they 're really going to spatter up.
so dry them off really, well, you do n't want your wings to be too cold either.
so , do n't take these right out of the refrigerator and plunge them into the oil?
otherwise it will lower the temperature of the oil dramatically and your wings will take that much longer to cook so the chicken wings are nice and dry.
now you want to work in batches.
you do n't want to throw wings in at once because it will lower the temperature of the oil and a grease will absorb into the chicken wings.
and that 's not something you want.
so gently place the wings into the pot and the track is really great.
because the wings do sink down to the bottom.
they 're not going to rest on the bottom of the pot.
they 're going to be elevated up.
and i 'm using about four pounds of chicken wings total try to fry your drumettes in one batch and your wingettes.
but in general, the wings will cook about twenty minutes in total.
so i 'm on my last batch of wings here, and you want to make sure that when you pull the wings out of the oil you transfer them onto a wire rack.
them , onto paper towel.
because what that does, is that direct contact with paper towel it creates scheme and one side of your wing will get soggy.
so use a wire rack to drain them off and to cool them slightly now, well, i 'm working on my last batch here.
i 'm going to start this sauce and the sauces than those important thing for your wings.
all it really is, is two ingredients.
so i have red sauce here that is the real secret, ingredient.
so i have one cup going to place it into the bottom of a small saucepan here.
and i 'm going to bring this up to heat just to a bare simmer.
it 's just up to a bear summer, you can see some bubbles forming.
and now i 'm going to add the butter.
so i have one cup of hot sauce.
and i 'm going to add four tablespoons of cold unsalted butter and gradually added in whisking until it combines.
if you wanted a more mild wing, all you have to do is the butter, a little bit.
so doing a two to one ratio hot sauce, two butter, will give you a mild wing?
this is about a four to one ratio the butter is nicely incorporated into the hot sauce.
i 'm going to turn the heat off and let this cool down slightly before addressing the wings.
this batch is finally done spent about twenty minutes right onto the wire rack to drain.
so now the chicken wings are going to go right into a bowl here.
use the bold.
that 's why did n't that you can actually toss the wings going to do about half of the batch.
here i 'll add about half of the sauce around the side of the bowl just swirled the wings around.
if you 're feeling a little daring here, you can gently toss the wings coat them evenly.
so are buffalo wings.
would n't be complete without a little bit of blue cheese dip and not basically is simao, a little bit of sour cream?
some blue cheese, of course a little bit of lemon and salt and pepper.
so there you have it buffalo chicken wings.
my recipe to you.
