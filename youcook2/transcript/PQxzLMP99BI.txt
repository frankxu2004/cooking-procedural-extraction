it was like eating cake in her day.
she scrubbed her cousins house and they 'd spend the evening making baksteen, gossiping and stuff like that, the absolute diehard.
traditional recipe is just made with raw potato, and i 'm a little bit of a die hard.
i do prefer my box.
you just made with raw potato.
but the fashion.
now is to use yesterday 's leftover, leftover spots as well.
so i 'm going to throw a few of them in.
because it is a good way drivers.
and we 're all looking for that at the moment so it 's so easy.
it 's unbelievable what you do is you take a raw potato and you greater into a bowl.
now you need to be a little bit careful of your fingers there.
cause pricing can be one of the more precarious of kitchen activities and the other thing to remember with this as well, is not wear false nails?
becaus that has happened to maine.
and i was, and it was stuck in one of his teeth, so that can happen too.
could do with a better potato, now?
what you want to do is you want to take all the starchy as much of a starchy moisture out of this, as you can, and then you can replace that starchy moisture with a little bit of milk or a little bit of egg and actually have even to binders.
well , actually this, this is n't too bad.
this mixture you can put it into, into a clean T cloth and really squeeze it out.
but i find that usually you can just do it with your hands if you have good strong irish hands as i do their small, but strong.
so you got your dry potato there and to that, i would just add whatever you 've got leftover in the source path from yesterday you really, you do n't want to have more than half and half free in fairness.
so this, just a bit of a have a long pit there, and you just mix that up.
now i 'm going to add into this.
now i 'm going to put the pan on actually.
because you do want really good hot pan, you do n't want any anything kind of namby, pamby going on with that pattern EG group of heat going.
so you just mix that up you need to put in a good scope of salt to taste is nothing worse than planned spot nice to have salt then.
but a flower the plain flour.
gold if i run out to pick you up we were so phrasing flower here.
it wo n't kill us.
mine , as well, and then you 're just gonna mix that up.
there have been a milk or, you know, what would have left over yoga if you 've got it as well to do the trick.
so you just want to, you want it good and wet you want this basically, these are potato pancakes.
so you want it to be the same consistency as a pancake in the spirit of pancakes i like to throw in an egg and he 's one of the reasons for this as, well, as an expression, my grandmother 's data over egg the pudding and what it basically meant was to make a food too rich.
but it was also kind of using expression for showing off a bit.
because eggs as a protein, there 's certainly want a rare commodity but, you would n't you know, you would n't be throwing eggs into things willy nearly either, you know they were a source of protein and they were a serious food.
so you be careful about how many eggs you put into a cake and you put the majority of your eggs are into a rich cake christmas cake, and we do n't.
we do n't have to think about those things anymore, you know, we think we know what we have a different kind of poverty now.
but in those days, you know, poverty was not having enough eggs.
so i do like to put.
i do like to put a little extra egg into things and think of my grandmother, die.
grown up children delighted.
that you sticking out the reagan, you know, enjoy yourself little, little right that looks a little bit, it could be a little bit wet be a little add more flour into that again, you know, it 's really just about look see, you know, it 's a pancake mix and just kind of look see.
and you know, what you put this in the pan is up and smoking, yet you put this in the pan and if it does n't work make a small bag.
and then if it does n't work, we just try again not normally, i do n't do this.
i do n't normally fight.
and some butter.
because does n't usually work for me, but to wear checking that pan is smoking pot.
and it is i do like.
i have to say the old traditional tradition class time pan.
now , that is, smoking.
i hope this is n't going to be too much for disaster be bit embarrassing if it is now there 's your box day.
it 's a nice little pancake house, if i put another one on as well in the pan has suddenly miraculously disappears with.
cool , down it 's not that the doctrine now there you go.
so you just leave that to fry away a few minutes.
you do n't want the most perfect shape.
it 's nice and messy, so we just let those fry the per minute and then we can turn them.
OK , we 're going to turn the pancakes.
oh , look at that i 'll stop the lies.
all that looks delicious.
yes , oh, get behind me, satan with a bit of butter and jam on that, where would you be going now?
i see how easy, that is, it 's just like a little two minute snack food that 's as quick as a pancake, you know, absolutely fantastic.
so we just let those hope for another second and when you use in the raw potato on its own, you really want to leave them, you know, you really want to leave them in the pan on a slightly lowest setting just to make sure that, that raw spot is cooked through.
because even if it 's, you know, not a soft as it should be, can taste lovely?
you can get a little bit of little bit of indigestion decided that all that 's good to go or i 'm going to have one of these right.
now get stop, it, i ca n't even wait for a plate.
i 'm not even going to wait for a plate look at this nurse face off the pan.
yeah , now you do is you just get a little bit of butter.
that , on there, yeah, i 've got a bit of homemade apple jelly here.
this is why i love the sweet and savory and saving this apple jelly.
now for a big box to blow out check that could that be any more delicious, and the stuff, my face room for the dying that is fantastic.
