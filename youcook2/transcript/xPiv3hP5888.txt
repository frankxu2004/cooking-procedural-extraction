lamb , you know, it 's just a meat and potatoes kind of dish which is why i like it and is made with lamb, which i love lamp.
i realize it 's not the most popular cut of meat, but or animal we have anyway, i happen to like it a lot.
so the way pans hot oils hot, now.
i 've got two.
one or two cups of onion and half a cup of carat cut up, be honest i got a little bit more in half a cup of care.
now we 're gonna take, going to pull the salt in, here.
salt helps vegetables cook a little better.
my vegetables are just starting to get a little color on.
we can do we 're going to throw two tablespoons of butter in here.
two cloves of garlic.
we put in two pounds of lamb that i bought a couple days ago, that 's why it 's missing brown and if it is still good impression suitable.
i 'm going to kill anybody today, anyway.
we 're going to brown this up a little bit.
OK , we 've got her mate, starting to brown a little bit, i want to go ahead.
and i want to season the meat a little bit of salt.
now this the, the stock that i 'm using today is the homemade stock and there 's.
no , i did n't put any salt in that.
so if you 're using a store bought stock that has lots of salt in it, you may not want to put any salt in there.
going to put the little black pepper now for.
herbs , herbs you can kind of use whatever, whatever you like, i mean, i want to put about a tablespoon of italian, seasoning 'cause it has a nice mix.
anyway , there 's half a tablespoon.
there 's one tablespoon.
and then we 're going to brown this meet up.
all right, we 've got a little color on our meet.
now you 're going to mix it up a little bit.
and we 're going to do now is i 've got two tablespoons of flour.
you 're a dump.
this , and we 're going to mix it up.
and we 're going to put a little color on this and what this is going to do is help thicken our sauce or broth or whatever you wanna call.
it anyway let me get this browned up a little bit alright.
we got that mixed and see i got some brown and happen in the bottom.
my pan i got two cups of lamb broth or stock.
gonna put this in, and we 're going to cook this down.
what kind of heat turned down.
it 's just simmering along come around once in awhile scrape the bottom that way you scrape up any back brown bits on the bottom.
because that 's really good stuff you want that in here.
and we 're just going to cook this down till it 's really, really thick.
our mixture sticking enough it looks really good with when turn this off.
no , i wanna.
do is i have half a cup of frozen peas and put them in there mister kind of blend them?
in oh, by the way, i have my oven preheating at three, three hundred and fifty degrees F.
it 's not quite there yet, but it 's getting there now, going to assemble this there.
we go dish.
now you can use any kind of oven safe dish that you want to use, it really does n't matter some of this due sooner there.
we go i would just about halfway up my dish just good.
now i 've got plenty leftover.
but what you can do is you can make one to cook.
now make another one, and then you can actually rap it up and freeze it for some potatoes.
these just leftover mashed potatoes maybe for the mashed potatoes.
i took boiled some potatoes so they were nice and softap, national some butter cream.
yeah , spread this out a little bit just like put in sheetrock.
it taste a lot better and you want to make sure that you have a little bit of room at the top 'cause you 're going to have liquid bubbling up through.
there , now i want to make some ridges.
the surface area the potatoes and help him brown up.
and then what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to pop this in the oven until the top is nice and brown and bubbly alright.
so , let 's take it out of the oven, oh, man it looks good.
i want to let it sit there and cool down before i cut into it.
and i 'm going to go ahead and take a paper towel just because i 'm extremely health.
conscious is dabba.
some of this grease off the top of it, you do n't really have to eat that it looks good and smells really good.
see how it taste.
