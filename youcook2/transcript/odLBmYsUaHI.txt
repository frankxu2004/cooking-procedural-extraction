so what we 're making today is a crispy baked parmesan chicken with roasted brussels.
sprouts with some dried cranberries and freshly grated parmesan cheese.
the whole recipe is about three hundred calories, including the side dish.
whereas a major chain restaurant has chicken parmesan for about eleven hundred calories.
because usually when you make chicken parmesan, it 's fried and oil anet smothered with fatty cheese.
and it 's served with a side of spaghetti, whereas here we 're going to make a crispy coding and bake it with the light flavorful cheese.
just enough to make it still taste decadent.
so one of the great things about this meal is the whole thing can be prepared to start to finish in thirty minutes or less.
so what we 're going to do is, we 're going to get our brussels sprouts, roasting first and then we 're going to prep the chick in an then everything will come out at the same time, hot and delicious.
so the first thing we 're going to do is some brussels sprouts there just have here.
but if you have small ones, you do n't even need to do that and i 'm going to toss them with about a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil.
i 'd like to do with my hands.
'cause then they can really get coated.
and then just a little bit of kosher salt sprinkled on there going to get these in the oven.
so what i have are some thinly pounded chicken breasts here.
or you can use chicken cutlets.
and i have whole wheat flour, but you can use whatever kind of flower you like.
but you really wo n't notice a difference.
if you use whole wheat, and you get the extra benefits of the whole grain.
so we dip it in the flower first encode, it.
and , then dip it in some egg, get a nice encoded.
but then, let that extra egg drip off what i really like.
is how crispy the coding gets almost like a fried chick in or a fried, fried chicken parmesan and then we dip it in panko, which is a nice light crispy kind of bread crumbs you can even find whole wheat?
so if you like those use, those, we 're going to bake these first.
so i 'm going to get these in the oven.
so they 're going to be baking with the brussels.
sprouts are going to bake for just about six minutes at high heat want to take him out and will finish the recipe.
so what we 're going to do now is put on actually going to put in a little bit of pesto.
this is optional.
but we love the flavor of pesto, so i 'm just going to spread about a teaspoonful of pesto on each breast for each chicken cutlet.
and then do about a tablespoon of sauce.
this is n't fresh tomato sauce that i got at the farmers market, but whatever tomato sauce, your family likes.
and then we take some of these fresh.
herbs , i have chopped up basil and sage here and again, you can use dried herbs.
but i really love the flavor of these fresh garden herbs, actually came out of my garden and some of the cheese, and this is part.
skim mozzarella and parmesan combined together and you can see we have plenty of cheese here.
so it 's still going to taste rich and decadent.
put this back in the oven for a six to eight minutes until it 's all melted, and the chicken looks nice and browned and then the brussels sprouts and be ready at the same time.
these are ready to go.
and so what i 'm going to do simplest thing.
i 'm just going to take these naturally sweetened dried cranberry 's sprinkle them on there and then i 'm going to take a little bit of it, you can either buy grated parmesan cheese or this is kind of fun also a fun thing for kids to do.
if there around just great, a little bit like maybe a teaspoon, then i 'm just going to toss it all together a little bit get the flavors in there.
those are ready to go and so delicious.
these brussels, sprouts, brussels sprouts to testing family into brussels, sprouts lovers.
it 's actually better then the italian restaurant that you 're going to take your family out to light crispy, delicious and still decadent tasting.
