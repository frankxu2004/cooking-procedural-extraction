welcome to youtube my name, is harpal, singh, sokhi, an axing, and cook we 're cooking mothers.
recipe something, which we all cherish right when we were children.
we would love to sit beside their mother, and they kind of look at what she was doing, and this is something which is very close to my heart.
i miss that taste of host.
i 'm trying to replicate that in youtube just for you.
what do we require, first of all, my mother used to, you know, grind spices that were whole, and them using the recipe.
so bought some coriander here round two large tablespoons of coriander?
one tablespoon of cumin into this OK, she would use black cardamom so you get a nice flavor.
this is very flavorful.
so i 'm just adding four of them some relief into this two three.
barely focus she would definitely add peppercorn, peppercorn to this cinnamon around two to three pieces, not bigger than this size, and.
let 's dry roast, this for some time.
this is something which she would really do you know all the spices, he would roast and then grind it very passionately.
she would cook the scary and the flavors i still ca n't forget them.
so what i 'm doing here.
nice spices, all of them hold and like dry, roasting them, i do n't want them to be color.
but just get that nice flavor out.
so more than thirty to forty seconds do not roasted on a high flame or anything on a high kind of burner or something like that.
so this should not be colored play with a nice now.
what i 'm going to do is crying this up or not beautiful blender here.
so let me just grind them all the price prices on that 's the beauty of this correct all the spices into the correct beautiful.
this remember our parents very dearly thought all this and used to passionately cook food for us, especially in india i 'm sure you would all agree this.
yeah , anywhere in the world actually sometime or the other parents must have done something good feed us nice food and this is what i 'm sharing with you.
so let me blind this is my son.
poudre all flavors fresh.
i 'll not unlock it because i want all the flavors to be absolutely intact next quickly like this, burner off, let me pour some oil.
some generous helping of oil actually two to three tablespoons of oil in this she would definitely use a lot of oil and let the oil get heated up in the meanwhile.
let me slice up some onions.
quickly , quickly, because the oil is heating up onions absolutely.
this into the oil, oil is hot in slice another one and slice three to four onions or chicken curry for making like a kilo of chicken.
at least four onions are required.
onions here boston, quick that 's what i 'm going and thanks to this knife.
all the onions into this summer getting ground summer, just added now so you get a great flavor here.
so let me give a quick store to this, not something, which i remember my mom would never do is crowned the unless she would not brown the onions.
probably becaus browning the onions.
this is making me cry emotional quotient gap.
becaus that would require too much of oil.
so she would just slice it an ad for this and cook it until it is translucent.
our tomatoes she would also not make fury of the tomatoes are one properly because i feel we were all living in small villages during those days.
you did not get anything that was hybrid you use to get what we call.
is locally available tomatoes that were locally grown, you would get that now?
those tomatoes were little tangir than what we have now did not so sweet as these hybrid ones, be cool.
now , yeah, wild onions kept cook translucent like shopping of tomatoes is also over onions.
now , getting lightly brown this point where i 'm going to do this at the ginger and garlic paste see, would use one tablespoon of ginger and garlic paste?
separately , one tablespoon of each then put the mixture an.
this , but just around thirty seconds, i mean, since india garlic cook down what we do, is add the tomatoes into this loaf you ring of tomatoes that 's important becaus one when you cure it matters i feel you do n't get a bright red color.
so do n't clearly tomatoes and sort by mother also never used to do if i 'm also not doing, it.
because i want to show you something which is cooked my mother style, you know, tribute to my mother here and sharing of this recipe, with all of you beautiful.
so let this get cook for sometime it 's covered this up and let it get cook until the tomatoes are absolutely mushy.
so that you get a nice gravy in the main wild this is something which we had ground all spices that we had cooked here there nice and course is not a complete folder beautiful flavor now.
to this, my mom used to add ginger powder also.
so i 'm adding half a teaspoon of ginger powder see used to add hold rights inches to the current masala.
so i 'm adding dry ginger to this and mix this up.
close it up.
'cause i do n't want all the flavors to, you know, kind of run away from this beautiful blend of spices that have made let it be here.
meanwhile , let 's look at that matters , then.
let them get cooked for sometime.
there is now check the models are nice and mushy, now almost few read here.
and you get a great taste when you use models like this, so now what we 'll do is add the rest of things and some chili powder.
she would add a teaspoon of chili powder.
two types of chilies gone inside.
now the black pepper and red chili.
now we have some turmeric half teaspoon of turmeric sort poop, taste salt, inside what some cream chili 's also she would add green chilies.
but sobered up just like this in a large with green chilies inside this, and that sorted this up beautiful.
what i 'm going to do is now going to add that check into this, so let me cook the chicken together.
no water just cook the chicken together with all the onions, tomatoes and spices.
second , there it gets hooked, meanwhile, about some coriander, my mother definitely would add a lot of coriander lots of coriander.
let 's chop this up and keep it aside, while the chicken gets coat.
there is coriander said the chicken getting cooked beautiful, now will lewis will add all these spices that are chrome so all spices here the little course.
but that 's what the flavor is.
that 's a beautiful flavor of the current masala, coriander, human pepper, everything.
and in goes the dry spice here.
all of it inside the correct, that 's what she used to do, grind only that bunch of spices that are required for the dish.
so that everything stays afresh.
if you wear to do this korean your house, do follow the way?
i am doing here now, beautiful.
suddenly this lot of flavors that have erupted from the chicken curry will cook for another forty five minutes before i add water to make a correct.
so let this get cooked for four to five minutes becomes nice and good.
because the chicken would also leave its own juices, and then we 'll add water as required to make a curry which is not very thin.
but not very thick, also.
so let the chicken get cooked here.
wow the lying flavors i must tell you and after sauteing just become too good you can just eat it like this.
so to this, at least three cups of water let 's bring this to a boil now.
beautiful , now this chicken curry, you see is not a very clean, clean dish.
it 's nice, and course, you see these spices.
they 're still course the onions are like whole and the tomatoes also like they got massive.
but most of the ingredients are really not enough fine texture form that 's becaus during my mother 's days, whenever i used to have a blender chopper they would grind everything in a stone, you know.
so that 's why most of the things used to be cost, so.
let 's cook this curry now.
boil little time the chicken also get scoped.
curry gets nice and beautiful chicken curry is not cook for around ten minutes, so let me give a stir.
as you open the lib what flavors and what flavors, i remember my mother beautiful, fresh spices course carry reminding me of my childhood days.
finally , some coriander into this lots of course, she would love to add coriander, and that 's.
because it also gives a nice fresh flavor to the current beautiful.
wow i am amazed at the way this chick in korea 's come out.
let me just have a quick taste.
i tell you have gone back to my childhood days.
same taste, same flavors.
it 's a stupid.
