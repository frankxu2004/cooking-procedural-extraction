hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with cherry tomato feta and basil scramble eggs.
when i think summer i think sweet corn on the cobb i think how is it possible to chicago, cubs suck again this year, and i think delicious sweet cherry tomatoes.
so , i 'm gonna show, you.
how to make one of my favorite summer breakfast, and one of the keys is missing.
plus we gotta, have all these ingredients ready chopped sliced ahead of time before we start cooking because this thing cooks so fast?
there 's just no time to do anything.
once the flame is on first of all, we have three farm fresh eggs and by farm.
fresh , i mean, just from the grocery store, three cherry tomatoes parade, i have nine cherry tomatoes cut in half.
some shifu nod of fresh sweet basil.
somehow pepper and feta one of my favorite cheese is going to give a nice pinch of red pepper flakes to the eggs give those a scramble and then we 're going to dump in the other ingredients.
there 's just no time to add those once the eggs are in the pen.
the feta cheese, the sweet fresh basil in our lovely sweet, one hundred cherry tomatoes.
i 'm going to throw a heavy, high quality nonstick pan on high heat that 's right.
hi , do n't be afraid?
and ice glug of olive oil about a tablespoon and a half maybe alright leave it on the heat until it starts to shimmer.
that means it 's really hot.
so that smoking yet.
but it 's shimmering and then dump in the eggs have your special in your hand and do n't do anything for five seconds do n't do anything.
wait for it.
wait for it and now start moving the pan, moving the eggs, moving everything and this is going to cook.
this is real time, however, many seconds.
this is, this is going to cook really fast.
normally i use a lower heat for scrambled eggs.
but the idea here is.
because we have such watery ingredients that cherry tomatoes in the feta, we need to cook everything fast before everything starts to bleed.
so that 's it.
how simple transfer to a plate.
i 'm going to top with some fresh sea salt, the fed has a little bit of salt in it.
you 're going to need a little more probably incredibly delicious, sweet, herbaceous little bit salty just magnificent and oh, yeah, there will be blood and by blood, i mean, delicious sweet cherry tomato juice and a little bit of feta milk, the genius of this dish, though is the toast soaks it up.
and you 're in summer, breakfast heaven, and cherry tomatoes are just perfect right now for this dish, so go get some give it a try.
go to the site all the ingredients are there.
although i do n't really think you need him and as always enjoy.
