hey guys and welcome to pirates.
today , i 'm gonna make fast food style hash browns.
so here we go i want to start with two potatoes.
i wanna peel the potatoes and spread them with a thick shader.
you basically want takes reads off potatoes now in a bowl.
i 'm gonna add, a teaspoon of salt and very, very cold water.
in fact, so cool, i 'm human add eyes, then i 'm gonna transfer my shredded potatoes in my boy, and i 'm going to keep it in that for about fifteen to twenty minutes.
so basically what we want is just to remove the excess amount of starch you 're going to need lots of myself power.
so i 'm gonna strain.
all the water out of my shredded potatoes that have been kept in the water.
i 'm going to squeeze the potatoes in batches, till all the water has been drained, but this is a very crucial step.
you need to remove the water from all the potatoes you can actually see the amount of starch that has been removed from the potatoes.
i 'm gonna remove any excess water with paper towel water should not be there.
keep that in mind now in a pan.
i , wanna add some butter and transformer potato.
i 'm gonna cook them on medium and not all the way through now.
what you want is basically the parader should be kind of a powerball potatoes, not wholly cook potatoes or right you do n't want him to do in round.
so basically each rate should be a bit form.
but not very fun as you can see all right.
i want to transfer potatoes in about let it cool for about ten to fifteen minutes so that i can work on them.
after that, i 'm gonna add onion powder.
some salt potato powder gone start reisler, and finally, a tablespoon of water you can see all the information and all the measurements in the description bar, down.
below i 'm going to mix it all up, and then add some more rice flour alright, so basically rice flour is added to combine an provide that christmas.
no , no, but we were going to transfer my potato mixture, cover it with another butter paper.
flatten it with a rolling pin and be careful you do n't want to over flatten them.
you basically want them to be around a centimeter stick and then refrigerated to four to six hours.
so that you can easily get them in standard has round shapes in my case, it is triangle.
so you can go in any, which shape.
what you want you can cut them easily when they refrigerated and their freezed.
so apparently the video has moved faster and my speech has been delayed.
but the last step is basically simple, flying you need hot oil.
and you need to golden fry, your hash browns somewhat like this now, the real test of hash brown would be the crispy test right.
let 's go and test the realtor, crispy test now.
this was recorded fifteen to twenty minutes after frying and to add insult to injury.
i would say, oh, yeah, now you can see how crispy they are.
and this is all this, is all been done in real time as you know, my poor editing skills so do subscribe to my channel.
thanks for watching fast food style.
hash brown, i hope you like the video and thanks for watching.
