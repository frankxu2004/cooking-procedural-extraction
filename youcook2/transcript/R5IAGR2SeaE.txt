i 'm a big fan of eating hummus as a snack at home, and i would say that i 'm about equally divided between buying hummus and making it myself.
i personally like the stuff.
i make better, my kids take a little embarrassing to say this, but i think they like the store bought better.
anyway , i think it 's better to make it yourself and you 're definitely going to save some money if you do it.
so why not give it a try.
the first thing you want to do is chop your garlic, turn the processor on and then drop the clothes through the feed to it works.
so much better than if you put them in, and then turn the machine on i 'm not sure about the scientific reason for that.
but it definitely does it gets nice and finely ground, you do n't have to top it yourself and then to that you 're going to add the rest of your ingredients it 's two cans of chickpeas that had been drained you can definitely cook your own by soaking them overnight and then simmering them in water to cover it can take one to three hours depending on the age, a quarter cup of the liquid from the can or the cooking liquid if you made your own about an eighth of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, a little more a little less it 's up to you and then some lemon juice, you can use up to a third of a cup, depending on how acidic you like it i 'm going to start with a few tablespoons in a quarter cup of tea knee is a ground sesame E paste and sometimes you 'll find when you buy it that it 's separated and there 's a bunch of oil on the top you want to make sure to stir it really well, sometimes i take it out of the container and cure it in a food processor and then put it back in and then some salt and then went or process at that, that 's it, it 's.
why would you not make it at home?
oh , you know, the other thing i wanted to tell you guys, you want to add a little bit of extra flavor to your homemade hummus.
i do n't care what my kids there i 'm getting much better than store bought.
and you 're going to think so to make this, and demanded.
it 's so easy so, much more economical.
and so much more delicious.
