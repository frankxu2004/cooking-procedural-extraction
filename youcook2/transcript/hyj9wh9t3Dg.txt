hello , i 'm david and welcome to one oh one cooking, easy, and i 'm here with another quick and easy one pot pasta spaghetti and meatballs it only takes about forty five minutes, and it 'll serve four to five.
so let 's get started.
OK , i 'm going to start with about a pound and a half of sweet italian sausage.
an all added one half teaspoon of onion powder, one half teaspoon of garlic powder.
one teaspoon of italian seasoning one half teaspoon of salt.
an one quarter teaspoon of ground, black pepper, ann with clean hands.
i 'll mix well, and you can make spaghetti and meatballs, many different ways.
you can use crown beef mix of ground, beef and veal turkey chick in italian sausage sweeter.
hot , i 'm using this week, and you can cook a many different ways you can bake him in the oven, you can fry them kokum in the souls and i know a lot of people will boil them just to discard the fat and then cook them in the sauce.
and i 'm going to do something like that, but not quite because that 's where all the flavor is.
i 'm gonna suck.
my stove on medium, and i 'm gonna add about two and a half to our cups of beef broth, or you can use vegetable.
now i 'll just go ahead and make the meatballs while everything is heating up and this will make about eighteen to twenty meatballs about the size of a golf ball torn it.
like this really does have its advantages, and i do n't mean just doing everything in one pot.
i have a small wood stove about a thirty five BTU and doing it like this makes it so much easier just to do all my wood stove.
and i can cook anything from a low to medium temperature on that wood.
stove it just takes a little while.
it 's like a slow cooker and this really speeds it up and i can bring two to three cups of broth to boil on that wood stove and hardly any time.
but two or three quarts and to have to boil that for spaghetti.
and that would take me all day i finished up my meatballs.
i 'm going to give that a quick stir cover and let that come to a boil.
i 'm still on medium, an once that comes to a boil.
i 'm going to reduce the heat to medium low cover and let those simmer for about twenty minutes, stirring every few.
OK , it 's been about twenty minutes.
i 'm going to set these aside for a few minutes, OK, i 'm going to crank the heat back up to medium and add the spaghetti and actually you can use any long cut pasta here for micelli angel hair pound for pound, that 's all about the same, as long as you can get at the lay flat and about two cups of broth that 's great.
this pot is slightly under.
but it still works out just falling and do n't forget about half a cup, will simmer off when you do the meatballs dragon a fork back and forth across the top helps?
keep it loose in all only do this for about a minute just to make sure it 's good and loose, then i 'll just cover and let that finish coming to a boil, an once it comes, to a boil i 'll give it one more quick stir with a fork reduced to heat the medium blow, and by the way, this possible need about six minutes to reach out dantay, i 'll reduce the heat the medium low cover and check it again in three minutes OK it 's been about three minutes and it 's looking pretty good, and it 'll need another three minutes i 'm going to cut the heat back to low cover, and i 'll check it a few times between then i wanted to finish absorbing the broth.
but i do n't want to burn it or dry out.
OK , it 's been about three minutes and it 's cooked a total of about six, and it looks fine.
it 's absorbed all the broth.
ann , i did n't need to add any water time to add the source, and i 'm going to add about twenty four ounces of tomato sauce.
then are at about two pinches of italian, seasoning.
and my pinches or about the size of half a teaspoon and two pinches of dried oregano, another one half teaspoon, each of onion powder garlic powder salt ann about another quarter teaspoon of ground, black pepper.
then i 'll give all that a good stir.
add pasta meatballs and stir them in cover.
turn the heat back up to about medium and give that about five to ten minutes to reheat and there, you go here.
one pot pasta spaghetti and meatballs plain simple, quick and easy, this has always been one of my favorites and.
now even more so, it really has n't been quite cold enough to light the wood stove yet.
but it 's getting there.
and i 'll be uploading again soon until then, enjoy.
