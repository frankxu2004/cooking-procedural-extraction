hi guys were going to be cooking.
today is an absolute beautiful italian classic spaghetti carbonara.
and i 'm going to show you how to make it this serves two peoples when i 'm going to be using one egg per person.
so i 'm going to be using two eggs.
beautiful pancetta, some finely grated pecorino cheese fresh parsley.
some spaghetti some sea salt ground, black pepper on some olive oil.
i 've got some beautiful punch.
aetherian , what we 're going to do is we 're going to cut it into little cubes and as the italians would say Q bettig for little cubes.
so we 're going to do is just slice it, and then just according to cubes, OK for you pass that.
get a big pot nice boiling water add a bit of salt.
very important salt in next at the pastor.
OK , well, get past this cooking were going to cook this pancetta to be nice and crispy.
so little bit of all, of all, not too much.
because pancetta is very fatty next idea from shatter, you want the pan on a medium.
here you do n't want too high because will burn it.
so we 'll just fry this off to get it really nice and crispy.
OK now that 's getting nice and crispy, i 'm going to have some nice, nice like pepper stare OK now.
my pastors ready.
it 's been ten minutes.
i 'm gonna have pasta.
make sure that you stare it.
OK next thing to do is do n't throw away this past the water.
be cause we need it.
we 're going to some of these past the water.
we notice some pudding pasta water in not cream, and what the pastor.
what it does.
it helps it become nice and creamy with the eggs.
so i never put any cream in there to make sure that you steer it make sure that he is on pretty low.
and then dyster, it keeps turning and had more pasta water.
if you need to, there 's no right way.
there 's no wrong way.
just put it in the cutest and you 'll become nising, creamer next at a good generous portion of parsley babe start OK.
T rex at the cheese a little bit of pepper, no salt, and then just lightly whisk next tenure heat off and then i do X and make sure.
they used all the time you do n't want scrambled eggs.
at a little more pasta water just to make it a little more creamer.
you can share a look at creamy that is beautiful.
make sure that you siri all the time creamy, that is beautiful OK now.
we 're going to do is we want to turn the heat up just a little bit, and then just cooked through the eggs.
so that the sort of a safe temperature to eat beautiful, more plastic carbonare is done, you know, look at how creamy that is, no cream in there just start water and eggs.
and that 's a secret.
that 's the proper way of doing a common error.
never put cream in it cause you do n't need to good.
so they go guys my pasta carbonare, or spaghetti.
carbonara simple to do simple ingredients.
it 's all about E control.
so let 's have a little taste of this looking at.
so creamy, that is, beautiful natural creamy like i said, no cream in there just start water connect beautiful, give it ago guys it 's really, really simple, thanks guys siri.
