i 'm gonna put my chili in there, and of course, i said, i 'm gonna use my secret ingredient, which is a potato.
and this is the one again going to bring the corey itself in such a nice or texture, which is under expectable things, happen like this that you do n't even put the cream and.
but you get the flavor or texture as a creamy look, and that 's all.
because of my secret ingredient.
so i 'm going to start it.

that 's another way of doing it goes on the side and then goal in the center and then now my turkey is a pretty much there.
this is what i have a chicken which i wanted to went to your attention.
once i remove the scheme.
