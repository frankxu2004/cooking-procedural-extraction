hi guys assignment of welcome back to the dietitian.
here again, with my good friends and muscle food, to bring you another delicious recipe.
i 'm going to continue to feed with the winter warmers, and we 're going to go with a hungarian beef goulash.
it 's going to be really, really easy.
i promise you is going to be one of the easiest recipes on channel, not a lot of components to it.
and you can make it in bulk, you can keep it for the week, you can freeze it.
you can cook it from frozen.
you can do whatever the hell you like you can make a massive, massive pot slow cook casserole.
it anything you like.
it 's so versatile so, without further ado.
let 's get going, and start a recipe, this car pan.
onto a high heat, make sure it 's really hot for this bit.
we 're going to add in about half a tablespoon of oil quickly, and wait for that to heat up cold press rapeseed oil does have quite a good a mega free count.
so definitely use it for cooking.
i do recommend it.
otherwise use coconut oil really good for cooking is added in the lane diced beef.
i got from muscle food discount code will be in the description box.
guys do n't be an offer to go along with this video, as there always is, and it only last for a couple days to take advantage of its description box to check that.
and we 're going to do with this is brown.
it so make sure all the beef is browned and keep it on a high heat.
and then we 're going to go over and tap, as soon as ass brown take it and put it into another pan to set aside, and in this chan going to go with another half a tablespoon of oil.
so that makes one tablespoon in total can you just get outta here up slightly.
and then we 're going to go in with one large diced onion.
two red peppers, four cloves of garlic and, and fridays for about five minutes, or less go back in with the beef, and i 'm going to go over two tablespoons of what auntie fee calls.
so two tablespoons of that this is the non smoked kind, two tablespoons of tomato puree give that little story star cook this for about two minutes.
now we 're going to add in one tin of chopped tomatoes is three hundred milliliters of water with two stock cubes in there got reduced.
so as actually really low in fat as well.
the one i use we 're going to add in a bit, assault ship.
this out and then some black pepper give it a stir and bring to the boil as you can see is to return of the pact pan.
it 's nowhere near as packed as when i made that chili, but i know what you 're thinking this dude.
sure needs some new and bigger source means when i 'm working on it.
i 'm working on it.
let 's put lid on it, turn it to a nice low heat round about that kind of heat and cook it for forty five minutes to an hour.
check out halfway through cars and only comment and say my kitchen burn down.
closer you check it halfway through you might need to add a little bit more water.
just check, and i 'll see in about forty five to an hour.
take the top off and just leave it like that for about fifteen to twenty minutes.
just so everything can thicken up a little bit just take a look at it.
now looks good.
cool , let 's leave that to pick him up and then we 're finito.
OK , two things left to do firstly.
take a handful of chopped parsley.
check seasoning before you do that you need more salt and pepper up.
mine is a touch more salt, and a tiny bit more pepper, and then start up through and then.
once i start through, turn it off and then there you go all done server up with whatever you like beer, crusty bread, with some reduced fat butter anything.
i 'm going to do that myself.
so i 'm going to play up and show you what it taste like and everything smells.
you 're meant to talk with something like sour cream, or it could be a good substrate.
i want to try and get a little bit of beef in a bit of yoga and a bit more parsley.
it 's not even when pressure cooked or casserole and the beef is still so softap.
you can even continue cooking it if you really want it just disintegrate into tissue.
if you like it a bit more meeting bit more chunks of meat as the perfect time to cook it.
so follow that guideline cooking for an hour and fifteen minute hour and a half.
into centigrade, so do that really, thank you for watching guys.
