hawaii , i 'm daddy welcome to bettys kitchen.
today , we 're making many corndogs and this is another one of our super bowl snacks, or it can be a snack for any occasion.
i 've made corndogs already, if you want to look those up in bettys, kitchen those are the full size hot dog.
so it 's just that long anh is dipped in cornmeal mixture and steep fried.
so if you like the full size, corn dog.
but if you 'd like to have the mini corn dogs.
because you have several appetizers, and you want people to have a variety then you might use a pack like this, which is called little smokies.
this is a fourteen ounce size, so if you need about that many then that will be what this recipe will handle.
you need more than just a gesture recipe.
so that 's what we 're coming back to after we get our coding together, and this is a corn meal server cornbread tap quoting.
but it 's thin and it 's just the kind of coating that you want for a corn dog.
so i 'll show you how we start down here at the end.
i 've already beaten one egg, so this is one well, beaten egg in a large mixing bowl.
i can be medium size mixing bowl to that.
i 'm adding some yellow cornmeal, you may use white corn mill if you prefer.
you need one half cup to just put that in there.
and then i 'm using all purpose flour, and he said it would go ahead and put the salt in an.
it does n't need the baking powder, or soda.
so this is going to be actually the best combination that you can get for the coding, one half cup of all purpose flour goes in there and then we have some salt.
one teaspoon of salt, and we also have ground.
black pepper, one half teaspoon up ground, black pepper, and then we have milk one half cup milk, and i think at this point, i should start mixing a little bit.
because the next thing that goes in is some melted shortening in my case is going to be melted butter and i do n't want it to go directly against the eggs.
because it would cook the eggs is still very warm.
so i 'm going to blend this together, and then add the shortening.
i mix those dry ingredients with the egg and milk and here 's the make sure that we have and you can see this little flower around the edges.
because i just wanted to get it together i 'm.
now going to put in some melted butter it is two tablespoons of salted butter, you may use unsalted if you like it 's not going to make a lot of difference.
but will just put that in and stir that together some staring just with a spoon and then we 're going to beat it a little bit until it 's mixed completely.
so it 's really important that you get a fine mixture here.
so you sure mixer again and mix until it 's completely beaten to get.
so here 's what you mixture should look like it 's a little bit thick for me it 's thicker than cornbread that i make.
but it will make a nice, coating that way and you 're more interested in it sticking to your hot dog or your little smokie or whatever then making nice fluffy cornbread.
so just pick up one of these with tongues and just put it in that mixture i 'm trying to get it covered all the way it kind of headed middle layer can get to the coding when you get it covered bring it over somewhere where you can let it drain a little bit and it if it does n't drip, that 's fine it can take that whole amount of coding.
but if you look at that you 'll see there is a little bit that 's dripping off of it.
so i 'm going to work on getting several of these coded and then the.
next step will be to take them over to the stove where i have n't peanut oil that i 'm going to heat to three hundred fifty degrees and when it gets to that level, will be and these mini corn dogs, and will watch some cook and they will brown up in no time will get them out, and will drain them over here on paper , toweling.
so that 's the plan.
let me go ahead and get these dip.
i have one inch of peanut oil over here.
heating and it 's almost to three hundred fifty degrees.
and i have some coated little smokies right here.
and i 'll tell you a counted how many there were in the package, and there were thirty four now.
if you took a pack of hot dogs if it had twelve in the pack annuar divided them and thirds that would work and that would give you thirty six.
so it does n't really matter where the use little smokies.
they 're convenient, if you use hot dogs and just make the mini by cutting them in thirds here.
we go i think we 're ready to drop one of these in so just use your tongues and get close to the oil.
drop it in, and you 'll see it float up in the top eventually anymore.
myself look up more in same time.
no using do these in batches so that they 'll all come out of the same time, too.
so just do for our, our demonstration.
here this is a little hot.
i 'll get that off in just a minute.
so i 'm going to see what we have going here.
these are looking good.
if you have a nice spatula like this, or slotted spoon, then it allows you to take care of a lot of them.
at the same time.
because you can bring them up like that.
i think i let them cook just a little bit longer.
i like them nice and tasty and brown but not leaving too long.
and i think i 'm not actually turn this off since i have gotten these ready that gives you an idea of what you 're going to be doing.
but i have all the rest of these, plus the ones that i have n't coded still left ago.
so i 'll see you back when they 're all done.
this is what your mini corn dogs will look like when you get them out of the deep fry.
oil anna nicely crisp and crunchy and there being drained here with paper toweling, so they wo n't have absorbed too much of that oil.
then , you just want to serve them on a nice plate, and here i have a plate prepared that has some dipping mustard in the center.
and i did n't put much.
because i 'm just going to take a taste of these, and then recognize delete a couple of them and if our my cam over there i want to figure out of them.
so will just get them after.
that , as we need it, i prefer the her lockers dipping mastered as many of, you know, i 'm just out of it right now.
and my store does n't carry her lockers to be mustard, but if you have a chance to try that it 's really great.
it 's a sweet mustard, but to get that sweetness.
what i 'm using here is a honey mustard.
so feel free to use honey mustard.
or if you have another kind of message that is the favorite viewers certainly go ahead and use that a nice presentation just to put those in a ring, a ring around a central dip and the dip in this case, probably is going to be something like mustard.
so i 'll come back and test them for you and just cemented, i 'm ready to test the mini corn dogs.
and i think they 've cooled down enough.
i did n't want to take a bite of one when it was just fresh out of oil, but will just take this one right here.
it feels warm and i 'm just going to dip right down into the master, so you see.
we have a nice bit of mustard at the end, and i want to take it back who entices sweet master that 's good, it has a good crunchy at time.
i like the flavor of it and then little smoky taste.
good , too, i think you 'll enjoy it.
