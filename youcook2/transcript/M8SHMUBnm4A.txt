OK gentlemen were making scramble eggs today.
and it 's very simple as you can see what i got here, two eggs and tablespoon of butter, that is, it very nice.
very simple, very fluffy, very yummy, now while our pan is preventing going to crack to it, alright.
so we put our two eggs into the bowl here.
so what we 're going to do now is, well we 're just waiting for a little pen to preheat.
we 're going to go ahead and wait for that to get to the point where they 're going to put the butter on it, it follows a little bit, then we 're going to scramble the eggs were not going to scramble them and let them sit.
we 're going to actually wait for the pan to be warm enough and then we 'll go ahead and scramble the eggs there.
it only takes about a minute or two anyway.
so you 're not that pans pretty much ready to go in about thirty seven.
OK , so our plan is preheated, and how do we know if it 's ready.
simple , we put our butter in you start to see the bubbles forming on the butter there.
see i was starting to form go ahead and let that butter get melted through see that.
but there 's a comfort.
bubbles are coming up through, and then while we 're doing that.
we 're going to go ahead.
and with these eggs, the key to whipping the eggs and the reason as to why we 're doing it is.
because we 're trying to get bubble seals, bubbles those bubbles.
or we 're going to make it fluffy more problems, the fluffy or the egg, we do n't need anything else to add to make it a fluffy hey for that butter is almost ready there.
so that fluff, but around the pants that beautiful butter, but he too, it is a lot of butter as well, 'cause it gives it a nice wonderful flavor.
so now we 're going to put our eggs in, and we put our eggs in what 's going on with him.
a little bit more before it put him in like this, and then look at, look at those bubbles absolutely beautiful.
now the key here is as we cook them, we 're just going to kind of move along a little bit like that one to the side and one to another side, little by little, and as we move them little by little you see the egg starts to form the scrambled egg starts to form there.
all right, so here we are twenty seconds later here.
everything is coming together.
the butter is getting nice and soaked up into the egg, which is going to be absolutely beautiful and lovely.
you can even go like this, if you like with some in the middle, does n't matter.
we do n't even need to flip it.
the key to it is just going like this back and forth.
that 's it really look at.
we 've got beautiful look at the color of that egg.
so we 're back and look at the ag.
now it 's almost finished.
you see that i 'm going to give it about another probably eight seconds because it 's going to cook once.
i take it off four three two one.
through that become fearful, and yellow that is done, and here is the final product here.
but you got here is your lovely scrambled egg.
and if you like for little salt on top and little crushed pepper wala there you go simple as it can possibly be, and it taste absolutely delicious.
