today , i 'm going to make for you are really delicious.
chinese american classic dish general sows chicken and to make it even better.
it 's going to be lighter than the original, so you have to feel zero guilt when you 're eating.
it slice four cloves of garlic, then you 're going to make your sauce.
i have in this bowl, a half a cup of water and to that add one tablespoon of cornstarch.
according starch adds thickness to your sauce to whisk that in then add one pound of snow peas, like then, two teaspoons of peeled and grated or minced ginger three tablespoons of light brown sugar general, sows chicken does have a tendency to be quite sweet.
it 's not even an authentic chinese recipe.
i do n't know if you guys know this.
but it was invented in the united states for the american consumer in the nineteen seventies add two tablespoons of soy sauce want to measure carefully and a half, a teaspoon of hot pepper flakes, you can also use fresh chili 's in this recipe if you want to OK.
that 's the veg portion now for the chicken portion.
this is two egg whites.
i just like to wish them to break them up a little bit, so they 're not all clumped together.
and then add three tablespoons of cornstarch.
this cornstarch is going to coat your chick in and make it golden brown as i 'm whisking this together.
i 'm reminded of this dish that i used to make when i first moved to new york got me this stitch, this is a pound of chicken.
he taught me this dish.
i loved it so much.
i probably ate it like three times a week.
coat your one pound of skinless, boneless chicken breast in your cornstarch mixture season, it was half a teaspoon of salt in a quarter teaspoon of pepper.
make sure that your chicken is nicely coated in your egg mixture, then heat your pan over medium high heat, and then add a tablespoon of vegetable oil.
once the pan is hot enough, you can add your chick in.
do n't crowd your pam because otherwise it wo n't get golden brown?
so , if you need to do it in three batches do it in three batches.
you want to cook these until the chicken is cooked through.
and they 're nice and golden brown that should take six to eight minutes.
the cornstarch and egg white coating is giving it a nice christmas without a lot of fat.
it 's kind of amazing.
actually , you can do this with other cuts of meat, too.
if you wanted to, i want to make sure that your chicken is nice and firm.
when you touch it and that it 's completely opaque throughout i use the ultra, specific technique of touching it with my hand and see if it 's firm.
i highly recommend that as there done you can set them aside on a plate.
now , you can add your snow pea mixture.
the liquid might splatter with the fat in the pan, so step back cook your snow peas until their bright green in the sauce thickens a little bit.
cover it up just for a couple minutes till they get nice and bright.
green , i 'm getting excited.
are you getting excited?
can be glitch?
i like to uncover them, stir them around a little bit as their cooking 'cause the pants pretty full right, we do n't want them to cook unevenly.
will take about three to five minutes depending on how crispy want them how soft, you want them looks pretty good to me?
i 'm going to add the chicken back in with any juices that have accumulated on the plate.
toss it around this is just to heat it through the chicken with any sauce.
it 's in the pan.
if you 're a real sauce person, and you want tons of sauce to drizzle into your rights you could double the sauce ingredients, the water cornstarch soy sauce, all of that, and that 's it really fast, i mean, i 'm not going to say that it 's totally authentic.
but , you know, the dishes and totally authentic to begin with so who cares.
it 's totally authentically delicious lots of vegetables.
crispy chick in sweet and spicy sauce.
serve it with some brown rice and enjoy.
it 's lighter general sows chicken at home.
