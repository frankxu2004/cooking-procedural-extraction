hey , it 's on hila into down highly cooking.
i have a special july fourth recipe to share with you.
so july fourth, AKA independence day, AKA one of will smith best movies ever am i right.
today , we 're going to make chili dogs.
and i have a little sound and it goes something like this.
shit , shit, shit chili dogs, chili dogs.
and i 'm going to figure out the rest of it later, go USA to make our chili.
we 're going to start out by opening a beer.
it 's very important that you drink beer while you 're making chili because that is the american way and oh, that 's good.
let me put a little oil in here, or a lot, whatever.
and i 'm going to saute this onion.
just try to get it a little bit soft.
we do n't really need a brown or anything like that and make sure that you chop it up.
real , real small, the thing about chili dog chili is that it 's almost like a meat paste, and i know that sounds delicious, and you 're probably just like flattering at the mouth right.
now thinking about meat paste.
but i promise that it will be great once it 's done.
just make sure that you everything, really, really small.
so , after just about a minute, your onions will start to look a little bit translucent, not totale.
but it 's OK.
now i 'm going to add jalapeno and garlic.
if you wanted to keep the smile, and if you are making this for like a bunch of children or something or very elderly people then you could just use some green bell pepper for the jalapeno.
OK , so now for the funnest part, we 're going to put our meat in going to put it on top of the onion.
now the second beer that you 're going to need is going to go in.
so the thing about the way that they get the meat to be.
so like falling apart, tiny little chunks is you do n't brown, at first you actually basically boiling.
it so adding a beer if you wanted to use beef, broth or something.
instead , that would be fine.
but we 're going to cook this so long alcohol when i cook off anyway, so once i 've got some in there.
i 'll start breaking it up a little bit.
and then i 'm going to add some seasoning.
so i 've got here is just cumin chili powder, a little bit of allspice, which is a little secret ingredient.
there 's red on it, and some worcestershire, shosh few healthy glugs of that in a little bit of dry mustard and could also just use like some yellow prepared mustard.
if you do n't have dry mustard, give it a little star going to add some tomato paste.
i really just like this, because it 's fun to squirt it out.
and i get to just like decade, all up OK cool.
so a couple tablespoons tomato paste, and basically i 'm just going to bring this up to a simmer and let it simmer uncovered for about an hour.
OK , one hour later this is what we 're looking at.
i just heard this about every fifteen minutes or so, and now at the very end, give it a taste.
add some salt.
if you think it needs it, but remember that hot dogs usually pretty salty too, so, maybe you could, under salt, it.
i 'm just going to add a little touch just a smidge of some apple cider vinegar and i happen to love vinegar and sour things.
not that, that really makes this like sour.
but i just think it makes it taste more like chili dog chili.
but it 's optional if you just give it a taste if it seems a little bit, like it needs a little perk.
then try a little bit of vinegar.
that 's a good tip generally in life.
move this aside and shut up.
i 'm going to show you my favorite way to cook hot dogs inside, so i 've got my skillet here with a little bit of water in it.
so i 'm going to throw a couple of weenies in here.
basically , i 'm sort of combining the steam or boil hot dog method with a little bit of a fry.
so i 'm going to bring this up to a simmer just kind of let these cook and told the water evaporates it by then, they 'll be nice and warm, and some of the fat will have rendered out.
and then we 'll let them sort of fry and crisp up in whatever in the pan.
so just watch and see it 's going to be magical.
OK , so our waters almost evaporated off here a few minutes later and just going to leave him in the dry pan.
now for just a couple seconds on each side to get the casing.
nice and crispy, got my bun.
here you could heat these up in the oven, wrapped up in foil, kind of get him steamed.
so i like a little bit of cheese.
i like to put the cheese down in between the chili in the hot dog to make sure it gets melted.
dude church, church, a chili dog, see this chili is great 'cause it 's nice and thick so it 's not like running out of the bun.
it 's just sort of staying where you put it, and it 's not going to make your button like super wet and soggy little onion.
because i like a spicy.
i 'm going to do a little jalapeno little pickled jalapeno there super yummy.
and then a little bloop just like in the cartoons, let 's give it a taste of rooney that 's just like a perfect little submarine of goodness.
good lord look at that tell me, you do n't want to eat that right now.
