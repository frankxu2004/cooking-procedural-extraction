i had this for the first time when my parents brought me to new york when i was told the result and we went to the legendary new york chinatown.

in fact, we did n't have any clubs.
we belonged to the sense of normally, despite all of this.
i 've learned how to make this dish, and i 'm going to share it with you today.
it takes or two more than a stir fry.
but it 's definitely worth it going to start with the sauce.
i 'm just going to take some dark or black soy sauce.
dark soy sauce has actually been fermented with molasses, making it richer and a bit sweeter.
if you ca n't find dark soy sauce, regular soy sauce is fine little bit of cornstarch, little bit of xiaoxing wine.
if you do n't have xiaoxing wine, you can use dry sherry, some rice vinegar little bit of sugar for the sweetness.
some minced garlic little bit of minced ginger and a bit of chicken broth.
so i 'm just going to wish this together, and we 'll set aside for later now.
we 're going to make the batter for the chick in this is a very light batter.
we 're going to flash fry it in oil, and then we 're going to saute the chick in, in the sauce.

some white pepper, some more xiaoxing wine or dry sherry and now some regular soy sauce.
