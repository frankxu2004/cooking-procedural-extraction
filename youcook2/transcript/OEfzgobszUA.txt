and one of the reasons is.
because we put in some roasted peppers in, we got two poblano peppers and one green bell pepper, you know, we took out the ribs and the seeds, you know, slice them in half.
then we grease the pan and put the peppers cut side down and then baked him at four hundred degrees for about a half an hour, you know, and roasting the peppers like this.
here it 's going to make the outside, dark and little bubbling.
and when you pull it out of the oven, while they 're still hot, cover him up and let him steam in their own heat for about ten or fifteen minutes.
this is going to loosen up the skin.
and it 'll peel right off, you know, when you want to peel it off 'cause it 's kind of class to keep.
but what you 're going to be left with is he 's awesome.
roasted peppers taste fantastic and you can use them in any kind of recipe, but they 're great with a burrito, filling, you know, so just die some up.
and then we 'll get to work on the rest of this filling were using a little bit of ground beef.
we 're going to go ahead and brown it up in a skillet if you do n't want to use beef, you know, just use a lot of beams the taste of the ground, beef with the onion and garlic, a lot of onion a lot of garlic, you know, throw it in here, while this, this meets brown enough and then we 're going to add some beans as well, we 're using one can of kidney beans and then one can a dog food if you do n't want to use dog food it just use some refried beans basically the same thing.
now with throwing in most of our roasted peppers.
were going to reserve about a quarter of it to use the topping later and then we 're getting off the heat best seasonings for chili?
powder cumin, salt and pepper, mixing it up.
and , then that 's are filling.
we go ahead and roll it up and some tortillas.
