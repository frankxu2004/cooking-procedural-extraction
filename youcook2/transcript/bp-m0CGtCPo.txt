hey , what 's up guys today, i 'm going to show you how to make a very easy and delicious spaghetti and meatball recipe.
so first up you 're going to grab a bowl and put some ground meat into it here.
i 'm using ground pork you can use ground turkey chicken or beef.
it 's really your preference next you 're going to add your chopped parsley than some chopped up garlic here.
i 'm using whole wheat bread crumbs you can use again.
really , whatever bread crumbs that you desire then next i want to add some shaved parmesan cheese some chili powder some oregano and some chili flakes.
and once you 're done, adding all these ingredients, just give it a really good solid mix, making sure that all the ingredients are there bread crumbs are absorbed in with the meat and then you 're going to start forming your meatballs alright.
so when you start forming your meatballs, you do n't want to compress the mean in the beginning in between your hands, allowing it to really become one solid mass, and as you start rolling in, want to sort of loosen your grip.
just so you have a really nice smooth meatball.
and this will prevent any large cracks from running through the center of that meat which in turn, will prevent your meatballs from falling apart, as you cook them once you 're done forming all your meatballs.
these are about an ounce and a half.
a piece you 're going to want to get a large saute pan on high heat with some olive oil in there.
syria meatballs for about five minutes or so, until they turn really nice and golden.
so , once your meatballs have a proper see around them are going to add some chopped up raw garlic to the pan.
give it a few shakes, and then you 're going to add your tomato puree followed by some salt pepper.
some dry oregano and some brown sugar.
then , you 're going to finish it off with some tomato paste and a good helping of olive oil give this a few stirs.
and then you 're going to let this reduce for a solid hour on load heat.
once your meatballs are done, you 're going to have a pot of boiling water going on generously.
season , it with some salt drop your spaghetti pasta in there.
and you 're going to cook this for about five to seven minutes and tell the pasta is nice and al.
dente , then you 're going to give it a good strain.
and then coat the pasta in a generous helping of olive oil so that the noodles do n't stick together.
and then we 're going to put this up alright.
so when you played the pasta just gently lay it on the plate using almost like a twisting motion.
and this will give the pasta almost like a.
spiral , weaved look and help give it some body as, well.
after that, you 're going to generously spoon some of the sauce over the top of the pasta, along with the meatballs, and then you 're going to generously top all of this with some freshly grated parmesan cheese.
and then i like to use some freshly picked basil leaves the leaves off the plant.
and it gives it just a beautiful pop of green to this beautiful dish and all there is to do is enjoy this with your friends and family and have a wonderful dinner.
do you go?
my dear is, this is a spec out enemy at the bottom is a good sign.
so far so first we need a little pasta.
big bite takes awhile right, you gotta.
commit when you 're eating spaghetti.
and you do this is true.
you have to commit you, gotta take like a wimpy bite, you sometimes people make meatballs like huge.
