one thing is you can add this chicken directly after you fry the red chillies.
ginger valley, to the mixture, and then cook it, but that way, a lot of people do not know how to cook it properly.
they can mess it up.
that 's why lot of the times in the last one so we use a frying method because it 's easy.

we 're getting stuck at the bottom.
and they were tearing open one very easy trick to fry anything very easily is use a nonstick kind of frying pan that way your meat will not get stuck at the bottom.
you will get the five product really good.
we can very easily separate this chicken by just taking two spoons, just lifting it and just breaking up any of the pieces now.

we 're going to cook in the sauce now, the chicken is three foot, coat.
remodels care OK, now the chicken is ready now.
if you have, says musee roy, you can use sesame E seed oil.
otherwise , you can use a regular con oil for this country either.
actually cut them into small pieces.
OK combo you can add as much eventually as you want, and make sure you cook till this red chillies, tarp wrong.
that way, the oil gets all the flavor of the chain.

even after cooking it is nicely crunchy and make sure you add it.
but if you want to add mushrooms bell pepper very cons and this is a little bit of salary, you can add any vegetables you want carrots or anything at this year.
test now bring in the sauce mixture that we mix earlier and add to this kick.
if you want your compound to be try add this source little less.
if you want it nice saucy with little bit of songs that you want to eat it with rice add more of the source, and you will get more gravy with your concoction.
you do not want to cook the sauce for a long time because you want your vegetables.
nice crunching, now you can add your chicken tip just to cook it for like few minutes, and then add the main ingredients.
