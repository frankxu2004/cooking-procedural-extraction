books that i explain the ball shelf that i 'm putting together.
some tacos from mexico.
he 's a real mexicana.
tacos this is n't the kind of stuff.
you see that a taco bell, these are the real deal tacos the way they make him down in the places.
i 've been in mexico, and they 're really good.
but they 're not what you think they are.
so i wish you exactly how i prepare the meat and put this whole chicago dinner together nothing can be pretty impressed with the final results.
let 's get started alright meet.
selection is very important in making your tacos.
you 're not going to use ground beef for these forget that i 'm not going to work.
i do n't even know what the user taco bell, but what i do is.
i marinade, my beef.
and i put a little bit of onion and some whole opinion with some fajita, which is basically flank steak that 's we.
he did the rez, and i just take a little bit not a lot, because the wine will actually cook the maid.
i 'm going to put a little bit of lime on to my fajita and then this is a boroo.
it 's just some sort of mexican seasoning may use.
it 's gotta think.
triple , different things openly did n't have any MSG or anything like that in it and read this.
but i do n't think it does primarily garlic, which they do n't even really like you use too much.
but the most important thing here, there 's, a little bit of kumon just a little bit.
so that 's pretty strong that 's been sitting around in your spice cabinet for a minute, you probably gotta check it, you need to keep that nice and fresh, even though there 's a dried spice, and we 're going to let this fajita meat marinate, while we far up are charcoal grill and we 're going to be doing this the heat off.
here in a minute alright we got our kohl 's just down to some members.
are fajitas now nicely marinated off is that right up on the grill beach right next to it?
and last but not least you put this little guy over here little bit of running on here hoping using her today gonna roast off right there in the cooking process at the overall flavor of the dish put that up alright, stick straight, up the grill.
still , have a little bit of a pink center in mexico, no way they want this stuff well done.
i do n't know if it 's for sanitary reasons or whatever.
but i 've never met a mexican.
but like there carnea, sada, their tacos or anything like that, anything but well done for maine, little bit different.
there 's the first batch of ajita meat and down in mexico, they do n't use have a hard shell or soft shell, and you have flour tortillas have to tiri is, and i do n't know why they would let him up to over like that, and then they just take with them.
eat right on top of that, just like that.
i 'd say get an order of mexico.
let 's take these over and will dress these up.
all right now for the.
topics , well, for one that got a lot of different kinds of cheeses of mexico, you probably never heard of casador OK for bronco.
i like manchego cheese on my tacos, the mahiko, it 's probably similar to monterrey, jack got a little bit here.
i got up.
but i 'll local mexican markata.
it was kind of graded up.
i believe it 's a goat cheese.
i 'm not really quite sure and then we 're going to put the pico de gaio on here which is a mexican spicy relish with tomatoes.
and cilantro you seen this in my earlier video, you know, exactly how to make that, and then of course, we 're going to top this off with a little bit of waka, moly would n't be complete without it.
and then i 'm going to use a little bit of choi, lula 's hot sauce to believe, i 'm pronouncing it correctly.
that 's what they would have done it for some reason on the counter, they would n't put a little dab will do you write on there.
and i have to give this.
the big takes test, those tacos were movie bueno K rico.
i 'll tell you what this may not be what they stared down there at old el paso.
but it did n't ship where it either this is a real mexican taco deal, and if you want to give this one a try you ca n't go wrong with it, it really is quite good.
been going down to mexico since the seventies probably down there forty times it 's always the same.
you probably seen a did n't do this ready to do that right.
yeah , so what i like him, page like what i eat down there maybe do n't have sophisticated as a pallet as you guys do.
but this takes like a mexican talk about of maine.
thanks for watching folks.
subby if you like my channel here.
i got a lot of crazy stuff going on.
of course, as always, and like the video, if you like it, you do n't tell me, why thanks for watching and as always, boneh , petite.
