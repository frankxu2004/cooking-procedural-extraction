but ordering takeout can be.
so fattening an unhealthy.
and this is pad thai.
this is ordering thai food.
it 's a really fattening noodle dish from thai restaurants and it has peanuts.
and it has kind of like a brown sticky sauce.
and it 's delicious.
but to make it at home it 's a drastic, drastic difference in calories, and it can be fun for kids.
so these are vermicelli rice noodles.
i 'm free now.
anne rice noodles are great.
if you 're gluten free, they have a great texture.
i happen to love them.
and then here 's a little topping bar, you 're going to make your pad thai noodles there a little bit wet.
dream them, but not completely because i 'm not using a lot of fat toasted sesame E, oil.
get the reduce sodium.
once your ankles do n't swell this is half a teaspoon of fish sauce in a lot of asian recipes.
there 's an interesting flavor that you ca n't figure out what it is.
and it 's fish sauce, darien.
it sounds fishy, but it 's not honey a teaspoon of honey needs that sweetness.
a lot of asian food has that sweetness and they put a lot of MSG and stuff in it.
so this is actually pretty healthy, half a teaspoon of lime.
juice thai food has alot aligned and then chili paste half teaspoon chili paste for that zip, then with your sorry, i forgot this garlic.
clove half a teaspoon of crushed ginger, an quarter teaspoon of pepper, and that adding salt because the soy sauce has solved now.
this is the fun part with your kids, and you can use whatever you have here some chick in bean sprouts.
if you have broccoli there carrots, and i find that when you involve your kids and let them kind of mix it up with you they want to eat it.
so it has cilantro which not everyone likes have these are chopped cashews.
you could use peanuts whatever nuts you like.
this takes five seconds to make it is so delicious and flavorful that you ca n't believe it.
but i have to have somebody from the audience try it, and i do this for my daughter.
you make you take a little piece of paper roll.
and do the rubber bands.
because the chopsticks it 's cute for kids to learn an for adults eating with chopsticks makes you eat much more slowly, and you end up eating less.
so take out pad, thai has nine hundred and fifty calories and thirty, add my takeout fakeout has a hundred and forty two calories and five grams of fat.
that 's a big difference.
