hi , everyone thanks for joining me today, so today i am going to make my southern styled, bake macaroni and cheese, cheesy, creamy a little bit buttery.
and it 's absolutely delicious.
so , if you want to watch me make it please stay tuned OK guys.
i 'm going to get started.
and this is going to be a small serving.
but you can adjust the amounts if you want to make a bigger tray of macaroni.
this is just elbow, macaroni.
i 'm going to be using that this is the small elbow.
this is some cheddar cheese.
this is not sharp.
muzinga , milder blend of cheese for this recipe.
and i usually use just regular cheddar cheese i do n't use sharp or extra sharp.
this is the mozzarella going to be using a little bit of that.
this is about a cup.
and this is just a little under a cup.
we do n't need a lot of this going to be using some half and half.
we 're using that this is what we 're going to be using to make our cheese source.
this is two cups of cheddar cheese right here.
i 'm going to be using these two items in the measurement cup going to make that fabulous cheese sauce that i 'd like to make, and then make the baked macaroni and cheese.
i 'm going to be using a little.
i ca n't believe it 's not butter.
i like this one because it 's very creamy.
tasting has a slight sweetness to it.
not it 's not.
sweet , does n't make the dish sweet.
but it 's just a beautiful alternative.
the butter, if you want to use water you can, i 'm not going to.
i 'm going to use this, usually, this recipe i wo n't see usually sometime this recipe calls for an egg.
i wo n't be using that today.
you do n't have to use egg with this recipe.
so that 's it for the ingredients, of course, i got my serving bowl right here in the back from my cousin diane.
she gave me her whole collection of corning ware bakeware and so glad to have it.
i love using it going to be baking the macaroni and cheese in that i will be using a nonstick cooking spray.
i 'll show you that as i go along and of course, of course, we 're going to be using a mixing spoon to make the chief source.
so right now on the stove have water boiling for the pasta.
so i 'm going to go show you how i make the chief source for the bank.
macaroni and cheese.
so right now i have my oven on its heating at three hundred and fifty degrees that 's the temperature.
you want to cook your baked macaroni and cheese, and i 'm going to get started now with the source, first.
i 'm going to heat up two cups of half and half, you can use heavy cream.
you can use regular milk.
if you like you can use evaporated milk or can milk you can use any milk that you like.
i think you should avoid low fat milk because it 's not going to have enough of the milk fat to keep the dish creamy.
so right now i 'm just going to let this get hot.
and i 'm going to stir story.
this is a dish that must be stord.
this part of your recipe and cream sauce, you have to make sure that you stay in the kitchen just to keep stirring it.
so that it could remain creamy and smooth.
OK guys so this half and half is nice and hot.
let it heat for about four to five minutes on a very, very low flame, you do n't want to burn the milk or scorch it.
you just wanted to get nice and hot, so right now i 'm going to add two cups of cheddar cheese.
i do n't want it to melt with them a lot of cheese in the pot.
so i 'm going to continue staring until we see the cheese, dissolve, or until we see the half and half start to change.
i 'll just color just a little bit, so now it 's good to keep adding more cheese until it 's all in the pot.
and you want to keep stiring.
do n't let anything stick to your partner that you cream, start a steak or your cheese?
you just got you have to keep starring this, she saw.
so it could come out really just nice and cheesy and not burnt and make sure you keep your flame on very low.
but right now while the cheese is melting in the half and half i am going to add the pasta to the boiling water and as you can see how it 's coming along if melting very nicely all this cheese is going to be dissolved into the cream of all be one texture right this is what it looks like it 's almost ready i would continue stirring this maybe for about another three minutes, just to let you all know that this is the same type of cheese source that you can use on your baked potatoes.
but you have to get a nice and creamy, nice and smooth, you can also use it on your broccoli if you blanch some broccoli, you can use this cheese source also on your broccoli and other dishes that you would like to add cheese a cheese sauce, too.
so this is coming out really, really nicely an hour pasta is almost done and then i 'm going to show you after you make your cheese sorts, which in my opinion is where you put in most of your work, i 'll show you how easy it is beyond this OK guys have drained my pasta, and right.
now i 'm going to just take this dick of I ca n't believe it 's not books butters this is really margarit i 'm going to use maybe like of quarter of this stink just to blend in the macaroni.
so i would say, i 'm going to use about that much in the macaroni and just want to give the macaroni and little extra flavor.
so it 's just going to give the macaroni just a little bit of extra buttery flavor not a lot, and, as you can see again this is a small serving i 'm making an honestly i think i probably made too much of the cheese sauce.
but that 's OK, it does keep very well and again like i said you can use it on baked potatoes you can use it on french fries, if you like you can drill a little bit of it on your vegetables like your broccoli and your string beans, true it 's really good on vegetables that she saw.
so i 'm just going to continue blending this butter in or this margarine in until it 's all melted.
so right now i 'm going to take some of our cheese sauce and i 'm going to put it in the macro not a lot, maybe like half.
but this end up dish, and, i 'm going to bake this between twenty and thirty five minutes OK guys.
so i 've got the macaroni and cheese in the dish i did lightly spray my dish with the wilton easy bake, you can use this for they can cakes and cupcakes and you can also use it for baking your food place it nicely.
so you have a nice presentation when it 's done.
so very quickly i 'm going to put a little bit of the mozzarella cheese on top.
now i 'm going to be using a little bit more of the cheddar cheese, put that on top also to give a little punch of flavor.
i 'm going to be adding some parmesan.
this is the freshly shredded cheese.
i 'm going to be using this.
i have a little bit left, i 'm going to just drink a little bit on top.
give it that three cheese flavor you can omit this part of the cheese if you want or you can add different cheeses sometimes i use spicy jack cheese to top it with OK guys.
here it is this is the finished product.
it looks absolutely delicious and got this recipe again like i said this is really high.
this was really, really easy to make.
you saw me make it, it 's very quick.
yeah , let me just go inside.
let 's just see what that looks like it 's nice and crusty on the top.
just the way we like it, you can get it a little bit more brown.
if you want it, that 's always up to you, but this is what it looks like nice and cheesy pottery.
southern style baked macaroni and cheese.
i 'm going to take and put just a little bit in this dish voiced ahead taste of vision.
so that you could actually taste this baked macaroni and cheese.

and that 's just the mozzarella cheese that i put on top.
