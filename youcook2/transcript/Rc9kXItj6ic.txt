you 're just going to pour it into a bowl.
i 'm a real hospital nutrition and lifestyle expert.
i love calcifying bad food.
so you can enjoy yourself, guilt free, get ready to treat yourself, wanna know my favorite dish to make for date night end every night of the week.
penne , alla vodka ibaka sauce gives you that delicious rich creamy taste you 're looking for.
but it is n't loaded with the sodium fat or so-called natural flavors found in most store bought pasta sauces.
so it might look like we 're making martinis tonight.
but actually it 's date night, and we 're making penne ala vodka.
first what i like to do is i like to add a little bit of garlic when you add garlic.
you 're just adding a little bit of spices also anti bacterial, and when you put, garlic it wo n't make your breath smell.
we 're just going to heat up the tomato sauce in the pan to.
actually , store bought tomato sauce in a can now here comes the fun part.
you 're going to add coconut milk in most penne, alla vodka is usually use cream or milk.
but some people are lactose, intolerant, and i do n't know about you, but i do n't want my stomach rumbling during date night.
right once all of this is just mixed up.
you 're just going to let it cook and simmer for a few minutes.
so , once the coconut milk and the tomato sauce is simmering in with the garlic in the oil then you 're just going to add a little bit of vodka and the vodka.
actually , once it simmered, and once it cooks, you wo n't even taste it.
there 's alcohol in it, it adds a delicious, delicious flavor, then you 're just going to add the peas during the last few minutes.
one of the tricks with pieces that you can actually use frozen peas so.
they do n't need too much cooking.
once this is cooked, you 're then going to take the brown rice pasta which is already hooked and strained.
and you can add the pasta to your sauce.
creamy rich and decadent your date is going to love it.
so once all the past is quoted with all of the saw, something that i love to do instead of parmesan cheese is i actually like to use almond flour super high in vitamin E and protein gives the same texture as parmesan cheese.
but it 's dairy free, so, if your date is lactose, intolerant, this wo n't hurt their stomach.
it 's delicious, it 's decadent, it 's rich, and it 's perfect for date, night.
