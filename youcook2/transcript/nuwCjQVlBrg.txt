oh , good and taag and, thank you for joining us again for cooking with us, he may or may not know my husband, and i just got back from a trip to europe and the last place we stayed was munich germany.
so today we 're going to make german potato salad and wienerschnitzel, an wienerschnitzel, actually means well, the schnitzel part just means it 's a breaded usually veal cutlet that 's fried.
but then venar part means that it 's actually from vienna we also need to be enough.
so it kind of works out and my husband this one actually it 's a lot of innocent little, while we were in.
so that they were going to make that today german self potato salad is very different from most popular cells that we 've had in the united state and that involves boiling uconn gold potatoes, potatoes.
so we 're going to first start with bacon, ca n't hurt every little vegan again, you know, there 's some people for thirty minutes, will it start back in oh, really potatoes hopper house we 're boiling potatoes for twenty three minutes, is we 're using your pressure cooker hopefully it 'll be a little bit less we ca n't leave mine pretty red onions here.
but we got one shopping right any amount, only one tablespoon until now, gransha card built into.
so we 're adding one teaspoons of sugar to it will be our mixture for potatoes.
two teaspoons of salt.
then , says wanna fresh cracked pepper baby three quarters of a cup of red wine vinegar, three quarter cup vegetable oil.
one quarter cup chicken stock, now this will be jealous.
and i 've never reserved lately.
i 've never, OK, we 're going to do two teaspoons of the bacon fat is it really helps.
it is american cool for a little bit before you remove the skins, hold it like this, and it 's getting just peels off, and that 's why you save your hand from being burn hot, that is, you can see this seem so, yeah, i 'm just using this part to take off the skin and it 's coming out really , easily.
it 's really cool with him.
so you remove the skins from our potatoes and anytime there in his mind crush or bacon, cut it into thin slices, and then into even small.
now gently mix it.
and we do n't want that this is good on something.
another , so this looks really, a lot more liquidy than what the recipe shows looks good.
though alright, so we are within our O salad, too.
just wrapped to me is that even agree with theron, says it tastes authentic from over in germany, so, i guess i did n't eat it then.
so i, i believe him.
and now we 're going to start with a reading pencil car versus in the egg mixture, and then the bird was finally.
and then they 're going to rest onto this plate lyrics crazy.
and never use bread crumbs in my life before.
so illogical say use two eggs, some say three since it 's a large pot i 'm going to use three and finally the flower, OK, we tried to get involved.
but let 's try to be super authentic.
so the viennese, intercensal.
but the only bill cutlass we could find at the major market here were frozen.
so these are tenderized pork chops.
so we do n't have to be then, then they 're pretty thin.
so it works out for us that we do n't have a meat mallet.
first , you dredge it in the flower.
check the car out, but in the eggs, but the eggs, rip-off, banana bread crumbs do n't push the red comes into it.
the right was made later on the outside, so there 's some lightly not hurt it.
but in the grand crumbs you did really good looking good, yes, it 's good now, i mean, i guess.
and then let 's it let it still dries out a little bit.
OK , that 's two if you 're looking for garden store at the packages, says lord on it, it 's what 's for dinner.
so this is the person i ever seen lard in person or hold it in my hands.
i said it has to go to the size of your frame, and a quarter inch.
so enough of that enough to do that, that is fine iron skirt.
my love, so the first thing we do is get the garden melted obviously temperature of the largest V, three hundred thirty degrees for you even tried for these guys, then 'cause what you want to do is put them in cook them for thirty five minutes on one side flip them.
and we put them you 're going to start paying the oil of the lard on top 'cause that 's going to keep it crispy.
and then we put in our oven, which is at ten degrees right now.
it 's been waiting.
oh , good boy.
he is a spoiled dog.
he is that really, very that there 's a lot of wired that you put into fright with is independence with the amount of lord that stays on the VMS condition.
maybe this could be the best dinner.
you 're very temperature.
two ninety, one OK.
so now we 're going to the dangerous task of pudding, are wienerschnitzel into very hot lord, which is not going to be pleasant men missile.
well , please be careful need, three minutes.
you doing very good move fast.
hum , everything i read says, do n't put more than one only shows one time benefits so we wo n't be fooled again?
will just be hoping that his face i am elements, while we wait for this being a douche, tinsel, terrence hanson lens?
'cause they go on top and i 'll see you sweet lemon juice on top.
the universal and not the really the way you 're so, see did you get hurt.
if you do n't want to do that so damn it looks really good welcome mam.
this finishing tool is the bone.
it 's next morning last night.
we enjoyed very much our winners pencil zenner potato salad, especially likely to solid state when your plate for a little while it does n't seem as vinegary at all it 's actually quite good.
i 'm going to share this with my husband for breakfast, even though we had two last night, and only have one.
we should obviously made a lot more than four, but now, we know how to make a very easy.
i just made copy as you can see.
i 'm being the dutiful wife has big, and it makes it breakfast right ship.
it some lemon juice.
on the guy, but he gave a solid finish cheese to the video, which i do n't think i did last night.
obviously it 's best either finish pencil right away because it 's very crunching so as you can kind of see their plate of leftover trainers and insulin salad.
put some lemon juice on SSL enough are smaller.
so , whatever apparently i think about it in that case could be like this, you know, is that i 've noticed it watching my own videos.
so the wiener, schnitzel is freaking good super easy to make.
and you should definitely try it three taste like germany 'cause its rate, most of it.
but obviously it should also be enough, or anywhere in austria i guess the potato salad is singularly villages, well there you have everybody this pork version of wienerschnitzel had the aplus thumbs up from me and did n't have one from there is, well, he 's going to eat it for breakfast.
eat it enjoy, and boots and apatit thanks for joining us anschau dallas east, buying kitty god, dustiest mind.
yeah , what it really is a hyper dog.
