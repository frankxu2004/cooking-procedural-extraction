it 's called coal cannon, and even though i am, part irish kind of grew up with japanese food.
so i do n't really know anything about irish food stuff that has potatoes in it.
so pretty much this is it 's a blend of creamy mashed potatoes, and you can add in cabbage, or kale bacon him milk butter.
whatever you like it 's, it 's a side dish.
so you can serve it with sausage or corn, beef or chicken or whatever.
so if you 're interested in that, just keep on watching.
i just found out that my dad used up the last of the potatoes.
so , instead of potatoes i 'm going to substitute in cali flower.
so if you just dean the cauliflower and puree is going to taste exactly like potatoes in trust , me.
it 's going to be good.
it 's kind of like a low calorie version, now.
i 'm also, also.
so i have a head of one head of cauliflower, and i 'm just going to cut into florence, and i have about a quarter of a rutabaga, rutabaga.
i do n't know rutabaga or something.
all you need to do is just cut up into small pieces.
and you just want to thinly slice the camp and just kind of break up the leaves so they 're all separate.
i 'm just going to add my vegetables into my pressure cooker, you can use a double boiler or anything to just steam the vegetables.
just takes some two minutes, so do it on high pressure for two minutes, all you need is half an onion?
do you want to just cook your onions first?
so i just added some chicken stock that i made last night.
and this is just because i do n't really like using a lot of oil, so i 'm going to add some cabbage now.
what would also be better if you could like maybe roast the onions and cabbage as well as the cali flower, an rutabaga?
it would have a nicer flavor, but like i said, i do n't really like using oils, so this is probably like most healthiest way you could do.
it will also add in the garlic and then just add some salt and pepper.
so now that my cauliflower in rutabaga are steamed, i 'm just gonna blend it now.
i 'm just going to add some chicken bouillon to give it some flavor.
now just add the cabbage and onions instead of bacon or ham, i 'm just gonna add some turkey and if you do n't want to use rutabaga.
just peer cauliflowers , fine.
and i find that just the cauliflower actually taste like mashed potatoes.
and that 's the final dish.
i added some chopped green onions and some toasted pepitas and sunflower seeds and the peters are just the shelled pumpkin seeds.
and i 'm also serving it with grilled chicken on top of sauteed, kale, and that 's just parmesan alright guys.
this is what it looks like i think if you just use the cali flower would n't have such a yellow look to it.
that 's currently reading this is really good.
it 's really, really creamy, you know.
i do n't even think i want to make mashed potatoes with potatoes anymore, and i think the only thing that 's missing in this dish is get old beer.
so come pie guys.
