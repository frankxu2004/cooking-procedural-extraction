hi guys, hopefully all of you are doing well.
today , i 'm going to show you how to make a simple weeknight staple.
and , that is just a simple meatloaf.
we 're going to do both, ate beef anna turkey version, and in the midst of all of that i 'm going to show you also how to cut a recipe in half.
so for those of you who have smaller families or it 's just a couple you can make a smaller meatloaf.
and you do n't have to worry about making a big two pound.
meatloaf , for just two people, or maybe before check it out, see if you like it.
and if i need too, i can also do a video on how to cut recipes in half if you guys think it 's necessary.
but take a look first.
off we 're going to start the recipe by dicing some bell peppers and onions.
and they were going to sate him off in a little bit of olive oil.
cook , the onions in the bell peppers for about five to eight minutes or until the onions are nice and translucent and just before they get done.
we 're going to add are chopped garlic now.
you 're not going to see that happen because i 'm going to show you how to save this recipe, regardless of an absent mind.
the next thing we 're going to add is our spices.
i 'm adding some paprika and some dry times.
this is your chance to use some of those dried herbs that probably need to be used anyway.
so go ahead and take the opportunity to do that.
these two work really well, together in this recipe and as soon as they hit the hot oil, you can smell them immediately.
this is a good way to always wake up your dried herbs now as far as ground beef.
we 're going to be using ground chuck.
and that means it 's eighty twenty eighty percent meat and twenty percent fat, which is going to give you a great moist result for meatloaf.
let 's talk about what goes inside the meatloaf, and i 'm going to be using some panko bread.
you can use whatever breadcrumbs you like i 'm going to be using some heavy cream but you could also use milk.
we have a beaten egg, and i 'm also going to put in some work chester sauce, which if you do n't have, you can add some steak sauce, which is a nice substitute for that.
we 're going to be adding salt and pepper to taste and of course, i 'm going to add some grand diamond all purpose seasoning, which you can get at GDC, zing dot com.
remember this recipe you can use any type of seasoning you want again, looking you 're covered and use what you have lastly greedy.
and then i 'm going to add is some beef broth that i had on hand, and i just wanted to add a little bit to the meat just 'cause i was being a little extra.
but this is optional on the recipe.
you do not have to add beat brock.
the whole point of a sauteing the onions and peppers first was to not only just cook them.
but give them a few minutes to cool about ten minutes and after they 've cooled then you can go ahead and finally add them to the meatloaf mixture just makes the meatloaf mixture just until it comes together, you do n't want to overwork the meatloaf once everything is thoroughly mixed then, we 're going to go ahead and give it a taste how we 're going to do that we 're going to make a small patty.
and that 's a way of checking with the meatloaf is going to taste like without having to wait to bake.
the whole thing what you 're going to do is take that patty turn right back around and put it in that skillet where we saute the onions in the peppers once it 's done.
give the patio taste and then adjust your seasonings to your liking.
now remember i said.
i forgot the garlic earlier that patty, is what but i have forgotten it?
so i went ahead and sauteed off about three to four cloves of garlic, and i was ready to move forward now.
we 're ready to bake.
so we 're just going to take the meat mixture and shape it into a nice loaf in a baking dish.
i 'm using a nine by eleven.
you can use a nine by thirteen whatever you have an shape.
it accordingly now, as you can see my meatloaf, the ways shaped yours.
maybe a little longer or little shorter.
that 's why when baking meatloaf, the times may vary.
so , what we 're going to do is we 're going to bake at three hundred and fifty degrees until an instant read, thermometer reads.
one hundred and sixty degrees start checking the internal temperature of the meat loaf right at the sixty minute mark, you should be close to being done by that time.
so just for kicks.
i wanted to show you guys a couple of things.
yes , you can cut a recipe in half, especially one like this is the meatloaf.
so you would take every ingredient and you would cut the measurement in half to get a one pound meatloaf.
the second thing i need you to know when you 're making a turkey loaf is that turkey is very lean as opposed to be the ground turkey.
i 'm working with here is ninety, three percent lean.
so that means when i sauteed the peppers in the onions.
i used way more olive oil.
that way i can return it back into the turkey law is chicken broth for moisture also as far as the glades is going to be a mixture of worchester sauce.
dijon mustard, cayenne pepper and ketchup.
we 're just going to wish back together.
but it 's only going to go on top of the meatloaf at the last fifteen to twenty minutes of the cooking time.
so we 're in the home stretch.
now we got fifteen or twenty minutes more cooking time.
so i 'm just going to take our ketchup sauce and just pour it right over the meatloaf and just spread it out evenly, and the same steps apply for the turkey loaf.
once the beef.
meatloaf is done.
you 're going to see how much fat has rendered out.
and you can actually use a couple of tablespoons of that fat as a base to make a roof in a skillet.
so that you can make gravy if you wanted to pour gravy over the meatloaf.
but i just prefer some steamed vegetables and some mashed potatoes or rice.
and you 're good to go.
so you want to treat this meatloaf like any other large pieces.
meetin , you want to remove it from the cooking dish.
it , on a plate, and then let it rest before you cut into it.
i do n't know why it 's taking me so long to put this recipe up.
but everybody needs a good meatloaf recipe.
this is your basic one that has lots of flavor and it 's easy to make you can even prep the meatloaf the day before, and then cook it.
ouf when you get home from work, and then for those of you who may want to bypass the beef option and go with the turkey.
it turned out just as moist and flavorful and even more figure.
friendly , thank you guys so much.
