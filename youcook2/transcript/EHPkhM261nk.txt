hey want to make perogy, according to legend hyacinth of poland, or as we call him.
yet accord revenge visited suffern borders of poland and fascinated by the taste of pirogi brought them to norful regions of poland, and.
therefore popularizing them it was around thirteenth century.
but the dish itself came from far east like china or mongo areas it 's unclear from where exactly i like the idea of chinese origin and due to the naming.
because it was named D R richmond tender ears and product similar to pierogie used for xoops in poland is called bushka, which means ears in polish regarding the name , pierogie.
it is said that it comes from the word period, which is currently unused and means literally fisting and parting.
however , when it comes to the name of the variation of these pirogi, runescape it 's not from russia.
it derives from the region, red roof, and yeah, which is in a polish rooster.
vanna that region is no longer polish, but it was back in the thirteenth century, you 'll need ingredients for though.
and feeling in proportions one, two one to get good amount of ingredients.
so that you do n't have too much feeling or otherwise for though i only used water and flour in proportions free to one three hundred grams of water, two, five hundred grams of flour some people add egg or its yolk.
but it stiffens the dough mix it thoroughly once, you are done cover, it with something.
so it does n't dry while you prepare the feeling remember to do it first.
so that gluten has time to work on the dough for the eight hundred grams of though that i prepared i used around three hundred fifty grams of white cottage cheese, three hundred fifty grams of boiled potatoes and two onions and spices salt.
you cannot herbs like marjoram, oregano, but they are optional.
if you are into experimenting, you can add some melted butter, or yolk of an egg.
it can improve the taste for some.
but it is n't necessary.
mashed potatoes, potatoes fried onion and then mix all the ingredients until there one mass taste it cause the taste of the whole dish will depend on the taste of the feeling, it should be lightly salted.
can be a little sour but should n't be too sour?
sweet taste is not recommended because it would be different kind of perogy.
once you are done with the feeling, and dough prepared the rope eroded first flatten the dough to around three.
millimeters cut the dough in circular shapes with a glass and put them somewhere else for later part, do not stack them by any means, or you leave yourself with shapeless mass of dough, and you have to do it again rinse and repeat until you have enough to work on them now.
is the tricky part put the feeling inside the dough and close it in semi, circular shape?
the part, that is left on the edge can be shaped.
personally , i like making this shape, but it 's not necessary, it adds the flavor when you 're posting pictures of your hand.
