hi guys alert.
but alley and, in this episode of blurring the kitchen i am.
so excited to share with you my fried chicken recipe i 've had this requested here for years and, years and the reason why i 've been holding off on is.
because i feel like along with a lot of recipes fried chicken is something people are very territorial, territorial about and they only like it their way or no way and if it 's not the way they make and then it 's not authentic and i 'm not saying mind authentic by any means it 's authentically delicious, and this is a recipe i go to for just a classic fried chicken recipe everyone loves it for the base just need a few ingredients which is going to be a chicken, and i 'll talk about this in a minute the key is some buttermilk and some hot sauce.
now there 's going to be more ingredients to come.
but this is the base this is what 's incredibly important number one, this by the way, is a war battalion rules number one the rule is the chicken must be bone in skin on, if it 's not bone in her skin on through self a favor in girls and chicken breasts and you 're good to go nothing wrong with it whatsoever it 's not going to be fried chicken in my opinion, not really good fried check in the second thing is you need buttermilk.
because the buttermilk what 's going to do it 's going to be incredibly it 's another thing that makes your chicken incredibly tender it 's a tenderizer.
so once it 's, it 's in it for a few hours if that 's magic.
some people use like a water and salt mixture to brian.
there chick, in which works just as well.
i 've eaten it that way instead licious.
i prefer buttermilk now, the pieces of checking, you used for buttermilk all up to you for me.
be dark meat, which is why i use the leg and thigh drumstick in the thigh, you can use the breast.
make sure it 's bone in skin on and cut it in half.
otherwise , the breast is way too big to go to your butcher, you should be able to buy pieces already broken like this or local supermarket.
they have packs of chicken already cut up, and i always choose.
you need about three pounds total.
so this is what i 'm using so enough said, let 's get this thing going the first thing.
i 'm going to do is i 'm going to take my chick in again.
bone in skin on whatever pieces you prefer, if you want to do the wing if you wanted, a breast make sure you cut it in half 'cause that 's really important.
now you can add any hot sauce.
you want to this, you can use tabasco, you could use buffalo sauce before me, my all time favorite hassles is saracha.
so i 'm going to use a really good squirt of it.
'cause i like a little bit of heat buttermilk mix.
this up, it 's going to be really lovely in spy scene and pour this all over my chick in looks.
and you can really smell the chilean.
the garlic from the saracha.
it 's just delicious.
but now i 'm going to do is i 'm going to cover this first of all, you want to make sure that your chickens really covered in the buttermilk.
i 'm going to cover this.
i 'm going to pop it into the fridge, a minimum of two hours or you could do this overnight.
i 'm going to leave it in there for a few hours, i 've got some things to do.
so it 's going to sit in there and performance, magic.
and we come when i come back.
i 'm going to show you the second step which is important.
i think i just checked my chicken out of the fridge is put in there for several hours or no instance job.
overnight , it 's even better not gonna lie.
so now we 're going to do is actually making the second part of a fried chicken, which is the flower, the flower coding, but i have here.
an , all purpose flour to this.
i 'm going to adam some spices.
my favorite combination is some steak seasoning, but you want to make sure that you buy the kind of salt free.
i 've also got granulated onion and garlic and i 've got paprika.
and you can add whatever you want, you know, whatever you feel like tastes really good to you.
i want a little extra black pepper, even though there 's a lot of black pepper in this big seasoning.
i want a little extra and always make sure that you buy your season.
and i love seasoning blends.
i think it 's fantastic by themselves.
free because sometimes if you do n't, there are so salty.
it 's impossible to put enough to have good flavor without your food.
tasting super salty.
so i 'm going to do.
now is just start us together, you know, must get together would not want to make sure that the seasoning is distributed well throughout the flower, and i also have a cast iron skillet there with some peanut oil that 's been free.
heating and i want that to be around three hundred and sixty five degrees.
and i also have my oven on to three seventy five 'cause that 's where we 're going to finish the chick in.
because sometimes what happens is by the time it 's fully cooked through the outside.
it gets really, dark.
and we do n't want that i 've got a baking dish or baking sheet here with a cooling rack on top.
and that 's because i just took this are the fridge now.
i want this to come to temperature for about twenty minutes.
i want this to come to room temperature for a good twenty minutes, otherwise.
if we would have cooked this straight in the hot oil, it 's cold so it 's going to seize up.
and you 're going to have really tough chick in so you want to always let you meet rest serving temperature for about twenty minutes before you cook it.
now what i do is i take my chick in and see if i can do like an assembly line.
i take my chick in by the hot sauce and butter, milk code, it really, well, in that flour mixture, make sure it 's really nicely coated.
and then i just put it on my baking rack here.
and what happens is it not only comes to room temperature, and it 's resting a little bit.
but the flower kind of dries up a little bit and sticks to the chick in and.
therefore when you put it in the hot oil all the excess flour is n't going to burn.
so i 'm just going to continue to do that.
let those sit for about twenty minutes, and then we 'll fight him up my chick.
it 's been sitting at room temperature for twenty minutes, and as you can see the flower has kind of looks adhered to the batter, which is exactly.
what we want is going to create a beautiful crust.
now i 've got my oven preheated three seventy five.
i also have another baking dish here.
they have it lined with aluminum foil just, just code just going through his time sometimes.
and i 've got a wire rack on top because we want to keep the chicken elevated at all times.
we 're going to start the chicken in the hot oil.
we 're going to finish cooking it in the oven, so i 've got my penis, preheated it should be really nice and hot.
i 'm going to do this in two batches, presentation side down so skin side down.
yes , see those bubbles.
that 's what you 're looking for.
it 's only going to be in the hot oil for four to five minutes on each side is not going to be long enough to cook the chicken completely, which is why we 're going to put this back into the oven.
now i 'm going to do this because the thighs are really big.
i 'm going to do four of the drumsticks.
i 'm gonna let those cookies at a splatter screen.
here i 'm going to tidy up and clean up.
put them on both sides and so there are beautiful crispy golden brown color, put them on our wire rack.
i 'll show you.
what they look like so we can put the whole thing in the oven, i just took my last three pieces of chicken out of the hot oil.
the only cooked for about four minutes on each side 'cause you really wanna make sure that oil is really nice and hot.
so that all your doing at this point really is cooking, the outside and extrude that be crispy.
crust is happening and then you 're going to continue cooking the inside in the oven, now.
the reason why again it 's on a wire rack is.
because you want to make sure that chicken is elevated otherwise if you want to put your chicken pieces straight on your baking sheet.
it 's going to happen the bottom going to soggy you do n't want that you want the air to jews around made up that word that 's right.
you want the air.
it 's a circle around the chicken.
get crispy continue remain crispy and the inside is going to cook.
so i 'm going to put this in the oven at three seventy five for another ten to fifteen minutes.
i want to test it with instant thermometer, thermometer it should read a hundred and sixty five degrees.
fahrenheit let those rest for about five minutes, and then we already did it again.
my checking was in the oven for exactly twelve minutes.
so make sure you have an instant read thermometer on hand just to check it 'cause you do n't want to overcook it 'cause it goes dry.
you do n't want to dry fried chicken.
not me now want to point something out if you do n't like your fried chicken as dark as i do.
because i really like a deep, deep, golden crispy brown you can certainly cook it less.
just keep an eye on it, maybe cooking on for three minutes on each side.
instead of four minutes on each side, it 's completely up to you just keep in mind that the color on the cross is the color.
so the insights in the continue cooking in the oven.
so if you like the outside and lightly golden brown makeup lightly golden.
it may not be as crispy though so i 'm saying add survey whoops little saracha telling you this stuff.
i let it sit here for about five minutes, and this has my name written all over it.
got , that is, the answer to die in my chicken.
