three healthy breakfast recipe today 's lighting is equally awful.
because instead of being early in the morning it 's late at night on wall late ish 'cause.
now it gets dark up basically four PM, which is really sad in this kind of weather.
one of my favorite recipes to make is minestrone because it is such a good way to have every color of the rainbow in vegetables, all-in-one delicious warming soup.
and wanted to share with you.
my recipe for it because i think it is such bring dinner also makes an amazing easy lunch that i never get tired of which is so important.
if you 're going to be eating something repeatedly throughout the week.
because you made a huge batch.
so that 's exactly what i 'm going to show you how to do tonight, we 're going to make minestrone together.
so if you 'd like to know how to make that delicious healthy soup, then keep watching.
so to make my version of minestrone, you will need the following ingredients from left to right four or five large carrots, a couple of parsnips for clothes of garlic, a couple of stocks of i 'm using three a large bunch as cal, a box of pasta, you 're only gonna need about half of the box if you 're making a very large butt of soup that is still plenty i 'm using cut macaroni.
although traditionally would actually use ditalini i just do n't have any on hand, then you 'll need a wedge of parmesan, including the rind, a large onions and crushed, tomatoes beans of your choice, i 'm using kidney and pinto, then you 'll need some stock and some red chili flakes if you like a little spice to your life, as well as the obvious salt and pepper.
the spice is i like to use in my minestrone or turmeric, which is really great for you.
it 's a great anti inflammatory, paprika, which adds a really nice little smokie hint, some time i do n't have any fresh thyme using dried and some fresh rosemary from my balcony alright.
so as i hope you guys can hear from that sibling thrown, i 'm.
now frying up my aromatic vegetables to that my father in my carrots, onion, garlic and also the person since i have it might as well stir fry it with the rest the only type that i would give you guys is for the kaylan any other sort of leafy greens that you might cheer minestrone do not add it.
now do you know when your beans or tomatoes or your broth instead of just going to show you all of those steps once listed happen softened up a little bit.
but you do n't want to add the greens until the document because otherwise are you lose all of this flavor and color and countries brown and grocery horrible.
you really just want to whip degrees in the soup for maybe about ten minutes.
i 'll show you guys that said when we get to it to my fried vegetable mixture i 'm going to add my crushed tomatoes.
and i 'm making a mess on my spoon because i am looking at this through a viewfinder beauty, grew problems.
you guys will not have this problem when you are making this.
i promise i 'm also going to rinse off the can of tomato with water after.
then i 'm going to add my first can of beans, which i have went really, really well, you definitely want to make sure that you do that i 'm going to dump my generous parmesan rind in there and make sure you fish that out at the end.
this shows and then i 'm going to add to this mixture, simultaneously, rinsing off my spoon.
i know i 'm.
so smart about ten cups of liquid or until you feel like it 's perfect for you, depends how much liquid you want in your bra.
and how thick, you want it.
if you wanted more of a soupy kind of consistency or more of a stew like consistency in my soup, has simmered for about two hours, which is a really good amount, you can do a little bit less or a little bit more.
a lot depends on how would like your carrots, and i 've washed and torn up.
my kaylan removed all of this stems the middle parts.
is that 's really tough?
and you do n't want that in your soup or anything.
really for the most part, you can see this looks like a lot.
but it 's really going to wilt down into the soup, an plus is good for you.
i would struggle to eat this much caliph.
it was n't all wilted, annina soup, so at that, and i actually just like to add my pasta at the same time.
so i have my elbow pasta right here.
and i 'm going to add about half of the box.
so , i guess that 's about two hundred and fifty grams into the soup, and it 'll just absorb all the delicious flavors as it 's cooking.
and then i 'll show you guys my bowl once it 's ready one.
so there is the finished product.
i think it looks pretty yummy.
you guys can see the steam rising off of it dramatically.
i really enjoyed sharing this recipe with you.
it 's one of my favorite staples for an easy falling winter dinner or lunch.
and it travels through the office.
really , really well, and it 's just.
so warming and comforting and full of a lot of different veggies, which is great for you, you.
so much for coming to hang out with me in the kitchen today from my meal.
mondays series, do you guys in my next video , five.
