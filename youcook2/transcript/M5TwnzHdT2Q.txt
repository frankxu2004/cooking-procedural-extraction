hey guys so a lot of you may or may not know that april is national grilled cheese month and two of my all time favorite foods are grilled cheese sandwich and the VLT.
so what happens, if you want both well, i have come up with the ultimate grilled cheese BLT.
so it 's a grilled cheese sandwich with a BLT stuff, too, right in the middle of it if you want to see how i took a spin on my two favourites then just keep on watching.
so on the pan over medium heat you just want to start frying your bacon an i 'm using thick cut center applewood smoked bacon, you can use whatever you want.
so just grow about until it becomes a nice and crispy and in the meantime, while of, that is crying away we 're going to take four pieces of bread i 'm using potato bread any want to butter one side of each piece of bread after you have the bread butter do you just want to lay the butter side flat down on to a pan and then you 're going to add your cheese an on this one i 'm adding, sharp cheddar cheese, and it 's just the whole brick that you can buy, and i sure did it myself you, wanna, add that to one of the pieces and then again on the other side, making these whatever cheese, you want, you can use how much you want it depends on you and then you want to take your other piece of bread with the butter side up this time, please it right on top and then what i like to do is just put a lid over it not in the middle of innocence amazing GUI once your cheese has melted you, wanna flip the bread over and it 's going to have these nice grill marks if you do n't have a pan with these like grill marks hip things you can use a regular griddle you can use whatever you want you just want to make sure that you have your heat on low just.
so does n't burn and get two brown on the outside before the cheese is melted.
now what i like to do is turn the heat off and just pull it over it.
so it just seems just to make sure everything inside is melted and.
now it 's time to assemble if you want to take one of your sandwiches and i just put a little bit of mayonnaise on one side i put down some tomatoes and lettuce, and then you want to add your bacon and assemble everything how you want it to mean that avocado, you can add whatever you want the creations are endless and then after you have your deacon, i 'm you want to top it with the other top of the grilled cheese sandwich press, it down together, and that is it looks like if you want to cut this in and fees you wanna serve when they 're nice and has issues julian melty out have you guys like this video and until.
next time bye guys.
