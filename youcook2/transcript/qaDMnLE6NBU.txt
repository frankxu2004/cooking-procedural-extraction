hi guys, it 's som in this video, i 'm going to show you guys how to make homemade fresh spring roll.
it has been a highly requested video over on my youtube channel, so i 'm finally getting around to doing that for you guys.
and it 's very easy to make it 's healthy there, delicious.
although it 's usually served as an appetizer at restaurants i like to eat it as dinner.
i 'll have like five or six of them in one, sitting and i 'm stuffed.
you do n't feel like a complete cow after you beat me.
i like to use now, tofu vietnamese ham and also shrimp in mind.
i used to use pork belly in my spring rolls.
but of course, that 's kind of fatty.
so i start getting that altogether, so, instead i replaced park belling with tofu.
i used to really hate tofu.
i used to be really confused when eating it and i used to be like OK take a bite OK to feel like what is it are you like an egg.
so , yeah, so, yeah, it 's really easy to make really healthy filled with lots of fresh herbs.
but i hope you guys enjoy the video, do n't forget to check out my other tutorial for my homemade vietnamese ham?
first , i 'm going to show you guys how to make the dipping sauces.
i added my hoisin sauce and peanut butter into a food processor.
and i 'm just going to post this all the while.
i 'm also adding in my sugar water just a little bit sugar with some water just smooth it out along with a little bit of garlic powder and just puree until smooth taste.
check it, make sure it 's yummy.
it 's all to taste really, it is and then dump it into something with the lid.
i 'd like to use mason jars for this, and now i know it seems a little bit running to you.
but it 's the perfect consistency for me.
it should be slightly thinned out but thick enough to wear.
she took your figure into the on to the back of the spoon, and it should all just stay and hold its shape, set this aside, and i 'll show you how to make the sweet and sour fish sauce into my measuring cup of adding in some sugar, along with some very hot water.
and you just want to stir this until all the sugar has dissolved and then adding your fish sauce mix.
well , then you want to squeeze in some lime, i know you 're going to ask, can i use vinegar, the answer is.
i do n't know how much i usually use.
one line, maybe a little bit more, depending on how you see it is adding some chopped garlic stir, and then taste check using my measurements as a guideline.
everyone has different tastes and then once it 's to your liking, go ahead and add in your chili peppers.
i 'm using fresh chili here.
and if i had ground chili paste i would add some of that in as well.
but i do n't have that but that 's OK, and just sure, well, and then, again.
just put it into something with a lid this stores or keeps in the fridge for quite some time, put this aside, and i will show you how to work on the spring, rolls you will need some cooked vermicelli noodles are different you might not have an angry looking vietnamese woman on your cover.
like i do but make sure.
you follow directions on whatever package, you have, i will also be using some tofu, some bean sprouts.
some lettuce, some sawtooth, coriander, which looks just like this, and some mint and cilantro.
now , for the shrimp i boil, these already deveined with the shell on that 's how you keep it nice and flat and then you just want to basically split it in half and then after that, that 's when you want to remove the shell and that 's it, it 's easy peasy and just continue with the rest of your shrimp and then just set them aside, and for the tofu, you just wanna cut them in half and then cut each half in two thirds an, you want them to be just about this size, and they also cut up my hand the same size as the tofu.
now for the rights paper today, i 'm using the three ladies brand you want to start off by taking one piece and completely submerging it into some very, very warm water trying to make it as even as possible, do n't keep it for too long a quick dip and then remove it tap off any excess water, and place it on a clean wooden board that has not touched any meat or anything like that you want to make sure you 're really safe and then just take your hand and smooth it out and then we 're going to start with the assembly.
so in the middle were going to play some lettuce, my thought, you 'd coriander submit again all these veggies or nice and clean have been washed and dried in my salad spinner i 'm also going to add in some cilantro, and i forgot to add in my what do you call that bean sprouts.
but i do then the.
next one and then you want to add in your cooked rice for micelli noodles, and then i 'm going to add on the side of my veggies i 'm going to go ahead and add in my slices of homemade vietnamese ham, and then my shrimp right.
next to it and then i 'm going to layer my tofu right on top of the ham i did two pieces of ham, two pieces of tofu, well, what do you know, i guess i did remember to add in my beans browse, i 'm.
now i 'm adding in my bean sprouts and then make sure you have enough rice paper to, to completely roll over your veggies and noodles once you 've covered that part you want to give it another tight roll over and then you want to bring in the sides right before you start rolling up your shrimp and the reason you put the shrimp glasses for presentation reasons, you can really put in whenever you want is just.
so that, to make sure that the shrimp shows see it 's nice and pretty, and you 're done.
so to show you one more time i 'm adding again my cleaned lettuce right in the middle kind of i 'm adding in my mint and there 's no real order to this, as long as you put the lettuce first and then, the noodles last on top of all of your veggies and herbs i find that it 's easier to roll, and it keeps everything compact and nice and tight here.
i 'm just adding in some more cilantro and now.
my fresh beans brown switch.
i finally remembered, and again like i said, top it off with your noodles now for my second row, again.
i 'm adding in my homemade ham, along with some tofu, two of each.
and for the final row, i 'm going to add in three pieces of shrimp and then again continue to roll just like i said before up been over, over your herbs in your veggies.
get it nice and tight and then right after you 've rolled over at your ham and your tofu you want to bring in the sides and then just continue to roll over your shrimp and you 're good to go help you guys make some tonight do n't forget to check on my other video for my homemade vietnamese ham click on the picture above thanks for watching.
