OK , in about five hours, the brisket is, is going to be done?
and it 's going to be phenomenal.
OK , that 's not a word i usually used, but that 's what it is, or banging or whatever you, wanna.
call it is just going to be awesome brisket, so now i 'm going to do my macaroni and cheese.
it 's called over the top, top, top macaroni and cheese its with seven cheeses muenster cheese mall chatter, sharp shatter, moderate jack mozzarella, provolone and velveeta those are the seven cheese.
is all used?
i have my first cookbook with the macaroni and cheese and since then i 've grown up.
and i 've grown into this seafood.
macaroni and cheese lady thanks to bud ellison.
my musical director who passed of a prostate cancer some time ago.
so whenever i cook this, i think of, but an it 's gonna be with lobster and shrimp added to the cheeses.
a in the season salt and butter and the half and half cream.
first , i 'm going to start by taking off the bling, bling the nastiest thing that you can see in a kitchen with somebody cooking and toss and food with their freaking rings on and long fingernails OK , nasty.
so i put the ring over here.
i 'll pick up some gloves because i 'm going to work this, macaroni and cheese with my hands.
and i do n't trust people saying people happy hands, all in your food and sticking it in chicken in just passing on stuff, or you, gotta, get the gloves or.
now that takes a little while.
then you get him on, and, yeah, hope that this bracelet wo n't fall into the macaroni and cheese it wo n't.
and they 're easy pour that macaroni and there is another piece, i mean, when you make a potato salad and stuff like that, you know, people use the toss stuff.
but that end.
but the cheese is in all right.
that 's one cheese.
is another one gave you the names, you should remember OK, you said?
the monster provolone, mozzarella sharp cheddar, cheddar, other cheddar, velveeta just cheeses loads of cheese.
is you like cheese, a hoe?
and then, you mix it and i 'll put the velveeta in last.
well , i do n't know.
but i just do, actually when it bubbles the yellow of the velveeta is really pretty.
i need to use as much cheese as you want.
actually , if i had time i will cut some more cheese and put it on the top.
but i do n't have time and this still lobster.
and this is the shrimp.
oh , you saute your shrimp before you put them in the macaroni.
do n't put in rosher because although it takes about forty five minutes for this stuff to brown, you know, the macaroni is already cooked senior lobster?
and i set up this is the butter.
spread it around this is the egg.
put it in.
there , kinda gross, using raw egg, but it cooks this is a season salt.
and it 's going in like this one.
i 'm going to mix it up OK, and this is a half and half watch, watch people when they 're doing their cooking shows and i hear all those noises, and it 's natural on making noise in the kitchen on television OK now.
so that i 'll have a beautiful color and the cheese in the macaroni it 's going to pull like a pizza.
because its mozzarella and provolone cheese now, i 'm going to pour this paprika on top and the, the gloves are touching.
the pepper rica.
the glass, but it 's safe.
safe , and if you want to put cayenne pepper in the top you can, if you want hot and spicy macaroni and cheese.
OK , i was it 's as pretty as it 's going to get.
now the only thing you have to do.
now is put it in an oven at three twenty five for like forty five minutes where you can just open the oven every.
now and then, and see if it 's brown and if it 's brown, then you take the girl out OK, do n't let it burn just letting it a pretty, pretty color brown.
this is the trash.
let me put this in the trash.
let me get my little beautiful cynthia mittens it beautiful.
OK , i 'm ready to put my macaroni and cheese and lobster and shrimp in the oven, i 'm going to put it in with my brisket, my brisket is cooking for like i said forever.
so every now and then check your macaroni and cheese to make sure it 's, it 's getting brown.
i check it every twenty minutes and that last twenty minutes it should be done.
i 'm going to lace it in the oven, here 's another one, it takes a strong girl.
careful , you do n't burn your here OK jesus.
OK , that 's it.
next , i 'm going to do my patti, labelle cabbage shuffle or whatever you want to call it is just.
so many things in it an you sort of a saute, it.
but sort of steam it sort of just cook it.
i 'll be back with my cabbage.
