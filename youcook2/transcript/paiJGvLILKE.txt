what 's up guys, welcome back to another episode of rositz, i know it 's been awhile since my last video.
but i promise you this one is going to be worth it today.
we 're going to be using two of my favorite vietnamese cuisines, bunmi, which is enemies sandwich and FA, which is a beef noodle soup.
i 'm going to marinate thin cuts of beef with the flavors that you find info, and we 're going to put this into french forget, and it 's going to be absolutely fantastic.
so , let 's get started first things first.
we 're going to start marinating are beef.
the best way to do this is freeze the piece of meat first.
and then you can thinly slice them eats very easily.
so i have my piece is already cut up.
i 'm going to start mixing my flavors, some of the spices that i 'm going to use that is going to mimic a beef.
A is going to be starting nice.
i have white pepper powder coriander and, cinnamon and clothes.
it 's going to be about tune up each when i throw that into my bowl.
one tablespoon of their sauce.
one tablespoon of white sugar and two tablespoons of ginger onion that i pureed one tablespoon of poison, poison sauce is basically plum sauce, and you can find it in your international grocery aisle.
two tablespoons of vegetable oil bring onions that i roughly chopped.
i was going to throw this in also going to add lime.
zest , and juice define is kind of dry trying to squeeze as much juice from it as possible, and we have all the ingredients for our marinade in our bowl.
we 're just going to wish this up.
would help if you have a little bit bigger bowl, but it 's nice and thick, kind of like a paste it smells really good?
so now that our ingredients are mixed together we 're going to throw that in with our beefs grab a zip lock bag bro.
our thinly sliced beef, along with our marinade can use a spatula to make sure all of that yummy marinade is going into this bag name.
zip it up and try to squeeze as much air out of this as possible.
because we want that marinate to be very cozy with the beef do your little massage.
so our green onion pieces are going to be cooked along with the B is going to be so good, telling you guys.
i ca n't wait all right.
so this is a fridge at least thirty minutes.
i have one already marinated.
we 're going to start cooking this up hop on over to the stove.
so hard to say the same thing.
our guys, you know, what time it is it 's time to assemble an eat.
so we just cooked our beef that 's marinating in all of those yummy fall flavors.
i 've got an ice caramel, ization on it.
i toasted my french, we get i 'm going to start off with some mayo.
so usually for a vietnamese, bend me, they use homemade mail which is egg yolks.
that 's been emulsify, did with some canola oil, two egg yolks to about a cup of canola oil and basically use a blender or whisk or stand mixer and you 're going to slowly pour in the oil while your whiskey in your egg yolks and emulsifies into this rich thick butter it 's amazing.
so i slap it on some.
may i 'm going to slather on some poison sauce on the other side again?
poison sauce is a plum sauce.
it 's going to add a nice dark sweetness.
two hours in village alright next we 're going to add our beef, our delicious beef that screening with flavor, so good.
and some of the fresh herbs that we use for PFA it 's going to be thai basil.
we 're going to add some typis, elise.

i 'm going to add bean sprouts.
OK , so i did this ahead of time.
i pickled, diakon in carrots because in a traditional vietnamese bend me.
they put pickled icon in carrots in almost every sandwich.
it 's going to be julian carrots and icon that is going to be marinated in about three cups of warm water, a fourth a cup of vinegar about three to four tablespoons of sugar and a little bit of salt an you pickle that for at least a day.
but ideally a couple days throw it in the fridge and you 're going to have it handy for any type of sandwich, she wants.
because it kind of adds a nice tartness nice start crunch to any of your salads or sandwiches must some jalapeno slices and sarrah, cha, sarrah, cha is found everywhere it 's in a lot of major restaurants you can also find this in your international aisle in your grocery store i 'm, i 'm for sure.
