hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with quick cured salmon that 's right.
this amazing technique is.
so fast, it actually takes longer to explain it than it does to do it and think about a white pay twenty five dollars a pound for grav, lox at that fancy grocery store when you could buy fresh salmon for twenty five dollars a pound and make your own.
it wait a minute.
so alright i 'll admit we really do n't do this to save money.
the real reason is so our foodie friends think we 're a badass.
so we 're going to get started in the first thing we need is the brine.
all i 'm, gonna pour some fresh cold water.
yes , we 're using fresh water this time and then to that we 're going to add a whole bunch of kosher, salts and a fairly decent amount of white sugar, and we 're going to go ahead and give that a stir until it 's completely dissolved.
and sure this would be quicker if we used hot water.
but then our water would have been cold and fresh.
because we want some nice uniform a thick slices, this piece of salmon is going to work the best, and then the prep this here 's what we 're going to do there 's a little bit of connective tissue right in the centre see that little street down the middle what will do is will cut on either side of that, right down to the skin.
but do n't go through and then simply turn the blade to the cutting board and slice it that way and then we 'll go ahead and do the same thing on the other side, keeping the knife between the flesh in the skin and then once you 've done that on both sides go ahead and slide that knife blade right through like that and that piece of meat should come right off the skin alright and i 'm not going to show up i 'm going to do the same thing to the other piece, and then once i have those sections removed from the skin we can trim it up a little further if we want you can see that little bit of gray flesh there where it meets the skin.
so basically anything that 's not that beautiful orange flash you can feel free to trim away define tuning trimmings done we 're just going to turn that piece this way and carefully cut about quarter inch thick slices and obviously, you can cut him thinner if you want, or thicker, if you want.
but if you want to use my brining times it 's going to be kind of important you get similar going to continue to slice that a cross and once are salmon has been sliced it 's time to brian, and i like to do five or six pieces at a time, i mean, i could probably get more in here.
but i know doing it in batches works great.
so better safe than sorry right you want to be sure about the cure.
so slices in the brine and believe it or not, it 's only going to sit in there for three minutes, it 's not called quick here for nothing.
so set your timer for three minutes, and you could probably just let it sit there.
but , you know, me.
i ca n't stand in front of food for three minutes without touching it.
so i do move mine around.
a little bit like i said it probably for no good reason and then exactly three minutes, later.
we 're going to fish those out on to iraq.
although you could probably just put these right out of paper towels.
i just thought the rack would look cooler.
but we 're going to finish those out.
and once they 've been removed from the brine very.
important , we need to pack those dry a little bit so take a paper towel and kind of block those off.
it 's OK if they 're moist.
you just do n't want to wet and then once all our salmon slices have been.
we 're going to go ahead and put those on a platter will go ahead and rap that nice and tight with plastic and then to finish the process we want to refrigerate those until ice cold before serving.
i would say a minimum of two to three hours.
although overnight, i think is much better, is he sit in the fridge, those slices of salmon kind of continued to cure, and you even get a little more reformer texture.
but anyway, we 're going to chill that thoroughly, and then it 's ready to unwrap and use and look how beautiful, that is right that colors depend that textures firmed up to a commercial smoke salmon or grav, lox or other type of cured salmon and.
because of that salt and sugar in the brine it 's perfectly seasoned.
so let 's go ahead and unwrap that and start figuring out ways to eat this one of my favorite in simplest ways is just to put a little bit of ginger just like a half of a freakishly small wooden spoon.
just stir it into a little soy sauce and then just give that slice.
he cured salmon a little dip and that is absolutely fantastic.
like that, so that 's kind of the minimalist approach alright.
if you want to go full food blogger, you could serve as a crudo.
the little micro herb salad maybe little green goddess underneath maybe a little grated horseradish over the top that 's another amazing way to enjoy this, and you can really get a good feel for the textures.
i cut it with a fork, i mean, it has that firmness like your piece of salmon.
would , but it also retains this incredible suppleness to stay luxurious texture?
or , of course, you could just channel your inner new yorker and do a take on a bagel and lox that 's just a pumpernickel everything flatbread.
and she 's a slice of the cured salmon.
in some chive, and that bite right.
there is just as awesome as you would imagine.
but hey, what do you do in imagining when you can actually experience?
so i really do hope you give this a try head over to food wishes, dot com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual, and as always enjoy.
