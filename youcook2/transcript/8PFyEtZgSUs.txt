hey kids, today, i 'm going to be making some perogies.
i made things a couple of years ago, and i learned how to do them on AJ deep categories channel on youtube and his wife and stuff, and she 's from poland, and she showed us how to do it in.
so , i started with my potatoes just make as many as you feel, you would need.
i made three, but i think that, that 's going to still be way too many.
and you go ahead.
and you prepare the, the potatoes the way you would mashed potatoes with milk salt pepper and go ahead an ad in your favorite cheese.
so i have a little bit of half and cafe wanna use up before it goes back well.
it has a while before it goes bad.
teen TV is what i think anyway.
we 're gonna go ahead and do that i 'm going to get a half a cup of milk ready for that, an egg, and then we 'll start making the paroki.
i 'll be right back.
i 'm just gonna add in parmesan cheese.
do quite a bit next at all up?
so we 're going to start with two cups of flour, an egg and half a cup.
i love milk and we 're just going to let.
me , i forgot to set up the camera so i can turn you off without getting drunk all over it.
we 're just going to mix this all up very, very simple recipe, and then when we get multiplica incorporated and we 're just going to drizzle it with oil, there was no amount given, i 'm not oil.
so i just have like two tablespoons here last time, we had them, we enjoyed them immensely.
we had them with meatloaf and this time i 'm making them.
so they can pretty much go with anything obviously.
but this time i 'm going to be making them.
because they are going to be used in a dish.
so let me just get this a little bit more incorporated, and then i 'm going to turn it out and start to need.
so i 'll be right back.
OK , we 're just going to, we have a visitor over.
so we 're going to just need this out a little bit and then i 'm going to roll it out, out fairly thin.
but it may be about a quarter of an inch.
and then cut it out with my biscuit, cutter.
OK , so i cut him out.
and i 'm just going to flatten it out and even a little bit more.
and then take a little bit probably a little bit less than that.
i learned the last time you ca n't put too much in just like anything that you stuff and then just seal the ends.
so i salted the water dropped, and we 're going to let them cook until they raised to the top.
and then they 'll be done.
and then i 'll put them on the side for the next step or dinner.
but this would be considered the end part of this video at the very latest.
so they have floated to the top.
we can take them out now and will be considered, done and a lot of people say that they like to put it in some butter.
