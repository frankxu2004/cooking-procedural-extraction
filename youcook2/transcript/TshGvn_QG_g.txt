hi , thanks for watching.
we gotta make the traditional california roll.
actually , that was the first california roll we make with the sea with outside lot of people, prefer the flavor of the sea with outside and a lot of the rice outside.
so we 're going to do is we have water too.
turn our hands of that rice does n't speak in our hands.
we had the sushi rice right here.
so we 're going to instead of this way and then it goes this way for this role.
so we have more room.
so this will be enough amount right just half of that space of avocado slices of cucumber in our crab salad, we have this crab salad already made in my channel is this video and how to make this without ingredients to do the crab salad.
or you can just put shape of a crab or king, crab imitation crab whatever you want, but the salad is better.
he has a little mail in the sesame E oil.
and then it gives a very special flavor so we can add roll it up right here now to the other, just this much, just enough to press.
it end because it 's kind of too much you can make it bigger.
but it 's not really nice and hearted.
so this size is pretty good.
so we just use the bamboo and press it.
this has a plastic wrap already, or lover.
but you can use with the plastic, then use the bamboo the little water on the other age, these sticks, together OK slice, it liquid water on our night.
so that does n't stick in the, the rise in power.
now this is it traditional california roll.
thank you so much.
