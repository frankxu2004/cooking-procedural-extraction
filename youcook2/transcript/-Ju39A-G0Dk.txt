OK , jacks, khalfani, here you 're cooking with jack on part, two of my mom is great series.
this is something my mom made.
it 's very inexpensive.
lot of you may be out of work, just trying to make the dollar stretch the end of the month.
whatever it is, this has a lot of flavor.
very , inexpensive cost, maybe five dollars to make the whole thing, and you 'll have tons of it, so and there 's variations.
so if you do n't like what i do you can throw some extra, and i 'll show you.
what those are as we go along.
OK , all you need to get started the very basic recipe can of kidney beans.
the red kidney beans, one thing of tomato puri and one pound of elbow macaroni and see this here.
it 's got all the dings, all the scratch marks is my mom 's pot, and i saw the lid for it, too, which is all dented.
so , let 's take a look here.
we 're going to bring into the stove and we 're just gonna show you how to put this together.
if you had pasta vazul before you will know, like at olive garden they put ground pork in it or ground beef in it, you can make different variations.
i have no meeting this recipe for you, vegetarians out there, they do n't want meat or can have it, or you 're allergic to it, or whatever it is.
so you can add me to this not a problem.
it will be just as good even more delicious more flavor, you know, the kidney beans first thing to go in is everything OK.
so just pour the kidney beans in there, there you go if you like kidney beans, put a second can in you want, through white beans in there, go ahead.
that 's where you can make your variations.
i have the light red beans do whatever you want then you 're just going to take this over the sink and rinse it out not a full can of water.
but just kind of switch it around, to get all that flavor out of the can here we go, do n't forget the recipes down below.
so you know, to write this down we 're going toward the perian then we start filling up cans of water OK, we 're going to put in a few cans of water once again, check below for the amount of water.
but we 're going to get all that goodness out of there and we 're going to add some water to the soup all right once again here 's your variation i put in five cans of water 'cause that 's what the recipe asked for and i 'm used to that if you like it, stronger leave one of the cans of water out.
makes it thicker soup an much more flavor.
OK , now it 's time to put in some oregano and when i was doing his tap it tap the side.
you do n't glop too much you 're looking at about one, one and a half to two tablespoons and there is the basil there we go.
where is the key?
this is another, another interesting part of my mom soup, she did n't put a lot of salt in she.
just put a little bit in she always told us you 're going to have assaulted at the table.
so this will need salt would just put a little bit of salt in there just to bring up the flavors.
but i promise you at the table you 'll font want to add salt and just little black pepper there.
you go i got the wet garlic.
so i 'm going to do two heaping tablespoons because we 're italian whoops sorry about that there.
we go beautiful.
get all the garlic off the spoon, too.
this is a fresh ingredient.
like to put in my mommys do dried, dried minced onions, but i 'm just doing fresh.
so we should have put in some onions too.
until the end of the batch.
and then just let that simmer going at symbol like a soup.
so once it started bubbling and boiling all the flavors get together you should be good to go.
the unions will soften up while you 're waiting for it to simmer get this going let 's get the macaroni cook does this thing take long macaroni is probably take longer so get that water boiling and let 's get the elbow macaroni cooked to OK first thing we 're going to do we got the.
macaroni , all cooked or put some of the macaroni in the bowl.
then you steal some of the soup with a big ladle.
now , you cook this down a little bit more, if you want a thicker, but i 'm making it how mom made it text.
you gotta, taste it make sure there 's any does n't any salt or pepper, many a little bit more salt.
but one of the things we did as kids little tabasco , he.
that 's right tabasco sauce amazing, oh, my goodness.
i feel like i 'm ten years old again.
this is an amazing comfort food, once again it 's inexpensive on way.
home i want to get a kidney bean, right there.
we go it 's really good.
if you like it, thicker, i would add paste, or just cook it down longer.
i like it a little soupy, so it 's really good.
oh , yeah, that tabasco just comes right out really good brown butter.
i even sprinkled cheese on top melt some cheese on top.
now do n't forget next weeks are big episode that 's right.
it 's my short rib marinade.
excuse me, if my mom sort of marinade, a recipe nozzles give it away.
but i 'm giving away the formula.
i was going to bottle this, but, you know, what in celebration of how great my mom is, i 'm giving, you.
