hi guys, and laura betali unless episode of lauren, the kitchen.
i 'm going to show you how to make tabouli salad.
it is so delicious really, refreshing really healthy.
just keep on hand for every day lunches to jazz up some boring, old chick in.
it 's really, really, really easy to make let me take your ready ingredients so we can get started returning some folder wheat water.
cherry tomatoes a lemon cucumber, scallions, fresh parsley little bit of fresh mint, salt pepper in extra virgin olive oil, so.
let 's just get right into the cooking.
because i 'm really excited for this in this pain.
i 'm going to put in my water now, if you follow the instructions on how to make bulgur wheat on the package, it tells you for every cup of bulgur wheat that you 're cooking.
you should use double the amount of water which is two cups would be in this case 'cause we 're using one cup of low grade.
i do n't like to use two cups of water.
i use a cup and a half because two cups of water makes this make it 's really fluffy.
and it gets too wet and muddy, and does n't really taste good, and it does n't have a good consistency, so to one cup of bulgur wheat.
i 'm using one and a half cups of water, and i 'm going to do is wait for that to come up to a boil.
my water is up to a boil time to add in the bulger wheat and a good sprinkling of salt.
because you want to make sure that your seasoning debugger eat itself.
so give us a little stir.
turn it down to low, put a lid on and let that simmer for about fifteen minutes.
and in the mean time i 'm going to get going to prepping the rest of my wall veggies.
the first thing you want to do is chop up the rose number.
rosemary , the parsley and mint now the first time i 've had i had the salad was actually not too long ago.
it was about a month ago.
porn ya, doing some work and they had lunch catered i wanted the items was this tabouli salad, which i had never had before as soon as i ate it instantly became hooked on it, it was.
and if you follow me on facebook, which you definitely should by the way, you 'll know that i have just been really obsessed with bulgur wheat lately, and i have been making it constantly.
because i love it for lunch with like just like canned tuna on top or even some good grilled chicken breasts.
it 's just so good, super, filling, and i just really, really enjoy it.
so what i 'm going to do is just finally chop these fresh herbs.
and it 's really critical that you use fresh herbs for this.
and i 've never tried it with any other combinations.
besides the parsley and mint, so i 'm not sure how it would taste if you want to substitute any of the two.
now , when i had this, it did have a lot of mint in it, which i thought was a little overpowering.
so i cut it down to only two tablespoons of mint bunch of parsley, so i 'm just going to finish messing this up.
that looks fantastic pudding that right into my larger bowl, along with the cherry tomatoes that i 've had.
i do n't like a lot of cherry tomatoes because i feel like they can become a little watery.
and i do n't like that.
so i 'm going to take my scallions and just mince these or chop them just nice and small.
i want everything to be like little tiny pieces scallions.
in next is the cucumber nineties.
this cucumber that i 'm using is called the seedless, cucumber.
as you can see there seeds in there.
so i want to remove those.
so get rid of the scenes.
i do n't suggest doing it this way.
i suggest you take a spoon and just take him out.
this way much, much safer, and smells really good that they smell super, super.
fresh that was a good thing.
and then i 'm just going to cut these into matchstick pieces like this little sticks, and then run my life across them to make little pieces.
last piece now, you know, i normally have everything prepped and chopped and ready.
but i did n't want to do all of that today.
because otherwise it would n't really be able to hang out everything would be prepped and ready, and i would just have to put everything into a bowl and that would be done and what 's the fun in that , right.
so in here.
with great some lemon, zest, i 'm going to have the great the entire zest of this lemon, great.
and i 'm going to also do sit cut in half.
i use a fork.
if really gets a lot of the juice out you would n't believe it look at that i grabbed another half of a lemon whoops because, you know me.
i just, i ca n't get enough of lemon juice and orange juice and lemon zest.
an orange test i just really, really love citrus.
i got one and two seeds in there that i do n't want.
here , you go, what hands to give us a good drizzle of really good quality extra virgin.
i would say about two to three tablespoons, salt and pepper, the veggies and like i said, i mean, you know, it 's just my husband, and i.
but i do n't let it stop me from making a huge bowl of it.
because keep in the fridge for a couple of days, and you 've got a delicious lunch ready for a snack or along some grilled fish for dinner whatever you want.
toss , all of this together and i 'm just going to set this aside and wait until my bald wheat has cooked.
and then we 're going to finish the entire thing up together.
my boulder week cooked for about fifteen minutes.
it 's so delicious, and perfectly cooked and not watering at all.
because we only used a cup and a half water rather than using the recommended two cups 'cause it would make it really.
watery , so you always want to use a fork to fluff it up just like you would, with rice, you just want to make sure you do n't scratch your pan as you do this, get it all out into your bowl and then using two forks, i just mix all of this together, and that hot bulgur wheat immediately wakes up the mint and parsley, and the lemon is just smells fantastic.
give us a good, good mix that looks great.
i 'm going to just give this a taste now.
i 'm going to be honest about something.
this is going to taste delicious.
however , give it an hour in the fridge.
it 's gonna, taste ten times better something happens where all those flavor it 's kind of soak into the bulger, and it just becomes something that it 's like ten minutes just an hour.
in the freezer in the freezer, an hour in the fridge makes a huge difference.
it took what ten to fifteen minutes to put it together, but it 's fantastic whoops that is outstanding.
a really, really is the mint is just perfect, not overpowering at all, but really, really delicious.
and i think it 's a crucial ingredient when making the salad that 's it but simple is quick.
it 's healthy and you need to go to WWW dot warren kitchen dot com to get the recipe, looking for your family, let become a lunch table in your house.
look it has a lunch staple, not stable being your house just like it 's become, and our house.
i hope you enjoy spending time with me and i 'll see you next time.
