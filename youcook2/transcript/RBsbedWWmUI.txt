i 'm going to start with a small pork chop.
an what i 'm going to do first is just remove all of this fat from the pork chop.
an once all the fat is removed, i 'm just going to cut it into tiny squares.
now to do this i 'm first going to cut it in half this way long ways and this is going to make two thin pork chops.
now you can buy them thin at the store and cut out this step here.
so then i have two thin pork chops like this i want to do is just cut them into strips.
and i 'm going to cut the strips into small squares like this, so that i have tiny pieces of pork just about this size.
i 'm going to start by just sprinkling in the ground.
and then adding the soy sauce and then with my hand i just want to mix these ingredients into the poor, once those ingredients are mixed, in i 'm just going to add the hoisin sauce and then again use my hands to mix it in.
and once that is.
next in i 'm just going to cover it and let it marinate for thirty minutes now, while the pork marinates one of the first things i want to do is just remove all of the clumps out of my rise and to do that.
i 'm just going to use my hand and just kind of break up these larger clumps like this, and once all the closer removed we can go ahead and just set it aside, i do n't know i think.
now here the carrots, which i 've already peeled and the first thing that i want to do is just cutoff, the end like that, and, once the answer cut, i just want to cut my carrot into about eighth of an inch pieces.
so i want to cut it like that, and then i 'm going to cut it like this.
so that i have small tiny squares just about that size an once all my character cut, i 'm just going to place them into a microwavable safe bowl and i 'm going to cover them with hot water and microwave them on high for about two minutes.
now this is compara, bulto, parboiling only it 's a little bit quicker.
now here have a green onion which i washed under cold running water and dried with paper towels, and i 'm just going to chop off the end where the roots are here, and also just about an inch from the top just to get rid of some of the wilted parts there and then what i want to do is just cut this into small slivers just about this size and once the green onions chopped we can go ahead and set that aside and, once the oil is hot, i 'm going to go ahead and add in the pork and i 'm just going to verify it for about three to four minutes and after about three to four minutes, they just wanted take the truck out, and placed it on a plate and set it aside, and, once that oil is hot, we can add artie spin of our chopped garlic and also are green onions and we just want to stir fry them for about thirty seconds or until fragrant and then after about thirty seconds you can go ahead and add of ride and we just want to stir fry, the nights for about three minutes, and then after about three minutes, i 'm just going to make a well in the center of my ride then i 'm going to crack my eggs directly into the center of the rise and just kind of break it up and let it cook scrambled in the middle like this and once the edges fairly cooked, we can just go ahead and mix it into the rice like that and, once the end is thoroughly mixed, in then we can return on pork to the walk an ad in our carrot and our store song and then just sir mix everything up together and once it 's mixed together, then you can remove it from an once the fried rice is done, then it is ready to serve , enjoy.
