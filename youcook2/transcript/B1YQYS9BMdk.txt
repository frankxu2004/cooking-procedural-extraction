now i 'm going to show you how to cut someone for sesame E and rejecting.
see , this is a berry part.
so this part is barely so that very part.
i 'm going to cut in two different ways for the better part.
i 'm going to cut it pretty thin, so i 'm going to again pro my life and really thinly like so place my left fingers like here.
and then pulled just going to keep cutting like this until i cut or the belly side.
this then going to turn this block, then i 'm just going to cut it to this way against the grain to about quarter, inch thickness in thurman meets really softap also.
so you need to be really gentle again.
PC can just cut it like so.
