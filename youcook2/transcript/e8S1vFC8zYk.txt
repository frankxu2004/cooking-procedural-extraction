hi guys, today on divas can cook we are making southern baked macaroni and cheese.
this recipe is very similar to the one i made on the nate berkus, show an, it is one of my favourites elf.
let 's get started.
OK , first you want to start by bringing a pot of salted water to a boil.
they were going to throw in that macaroni and cook it until it 's al dente.
i usually cook like a minute below elgin say, OK, so check the back of your box, OK.
all right now, we 're going to garys up our casserole dish with some butter.
now i have drained that passed us and we 're going to go ahead and add it to my casserole dish.
in a large fall.
i 'm going to add in some heavy cream.
we 're going to add in some milk, and they 're going to add in my cheeses.
i 'm using a sharp cheddar.
i got some monterrey colby.
jack , there an, i have some velveeta as well.
go ahead and throw that into the milk mixture and now just start up just like that OK.
now add in some salt and pepper and stir in that salt and pepper, you can also add in onion powder.
some pep rica.
whatever now you wanna, taste it make sure you taste it.
this is very important.
you want to taste really, really good.
i cannot tell you how many times i 've had boring.
macaroni and cheese taste it and get it just right when you have it just right go ahead and throw in.
those eggs go ahead and start that on in there like that there.
OK , so now it 's going to pour this mixture on top of the cook pasta, and i guess you can dump it all in a bowl.
and then just, you know, port in there.
i do things.
sometimes i do n't know why OK right now.
i 'm going to make sure that everything is nice and even and covered up just like sue and now when i 'm consent with it.
i 'm going to sprinkle on that, smoked cheddar did not forget this motor.
you guys, it really adds that pop that makes it unique and they get a lot of compliments go ahead and add.
that smoked cheddar on.
that i 'm also going to put on some more of that colby monterrey jack, as well, i 'm going to pop it into the oven, and bake it for about thirty five minutes, and then outcome this beauty right here.
i love how that cheese at top cheese has kind of made like a crust on my, gosh.
so good, but you wanna let this sit for about ten minutes before you go digging into it.
so that it has time to set up, and then you are done.
it is so good.
