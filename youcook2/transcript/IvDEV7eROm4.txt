hi guys, i 'm laura betali, another, this episode of blurring occasion.
i want to show you how to make a ridiculously easy, simple and delicious fresh tomato soup about a year ago.
i showed you how to make a tomato soup.
and this is just a slightly different version.
i still absolutely love that recipe, but i have been making this recipe so much more now.
my husband has a little garden outside our backyard.
so we 've got tons of tomatoes growing, and i actually showed sort of a few steps.
when i was making the soup on my blog on my second.
channel , which, if you do n't know, i do have a second channel, large topics and link.
it down below we 're going to start doing a lot more blogs.
we are doing logs now, so, if you want to check him out hop on over there subscribe and give us some lid a lot of people were like show us along in the kitchen how you make that super looks amazing so, i thought why not it 's really easy, required a handful of ingredients and, it 's just delicious, i 've got.
here are some fresh tomatoes.
so , some just some plum tomatoes i 've got some little baby.
heirloom tomato yellow tomatoes.
i 've got fresh basil, a pinch of sugar.
balsamic vinegar painted hot pepper flakes some fresh oregano garlic and shallots.
not nothing, nothing else, we said the little bit of stuff to thin it out after out of course, pepper olive oil, but anyways it 's easy.
going to take first of all, you want to preheat the oven to four twenty five.
i 've got a nine by thirteen inch pan here.
now , i know that this is going to look like there 's a lot of tomatoes, and they should all be in one layer, not doing that i 'm actually, i chose to use a smaller pan for a reason.
because as much as i do want this, to karma lies and they will i want them to give out a lot of their own juice, and i want that to be some of the liquid that when i blended i want it to be some of the liquid that 's there.
so it just works really, really, well, i 'm just having my tomatoes now.
these because, you know, our tomatoes we just kind of pick a few.
every single day and there 's some that are n't ripe yet.
but i wanted to share this recipe with you, and i went to a farmers market, and i mean, look how beautiful these tomatoes are i could n't pass them up.
you can also make some match some roma tomatoes plumbing to me that way.
maybe you name it whatever, you 've got this fresh in season at its best all i 'm doing with my garlic is just fashion it with my knife getting rid of skin and popping your running there 'cause it 's going to happen is see.
because we 're not roasting in all in a single layer it 's not going to develop a lot of color and burn.
it 's kind of bubble in its own juices again.
i 'm going to normalize a bit at the top.
but those flavors are going to be so sweet and delicious that i 'm putting a lot of garlic in there because it is going to be so sweet.
so when you do go ahead and puree it is just there 's absolutely no overpowering of garlic whatsoever, do of course could leave some out, completely up to you.
i 'm adding some shallots last time.
i made this in the blog, i even added some green onion tops.
because i used the whites for different recipe, i mean, again it 's going to get pureed anyway.
so , my as well, just going to take the very first layer off.
i 'm starting my shouts right in adding my hot pepper flakes and dried oregano small little pinch of sugar is about a teaspoon of sugar and then just the touch of balsamic vinegar, you know, the sugar, balsamic vinegar, all they 're really doing is helping with the whole formalization it 's really all, it 's doing and bringing up the sweetness in the tomatoes tons of fresh basil, stops in all good amount of extra virgin olive oil.
because at the end of day this is kind of what 's going to give you those delicious juices and what those tomatoes are going to roast in.
so you want to make sure you had a good.
maybe quarter cup.
or so this is going to make valve four to six servings depending on how big your serving is.
so about four tablespoons of olive oil it 's completely enough for four to six people.
anything that amount salt and pepper, good mouse saw.
because tomatoes are very, very sweet in this closer to me and just going with your hands and mix it all together.
this is going to be amazing when you put this into the oven and let it roast all right.
make sure you get that balsamic and not sugar distributed really, well, oops.
OK , i 'm going to wash my hands pop this into the oven, four twenty, five for about an hour and a quarter give it a stir every.
now and then.
i 'll show you what they look like when they 're done.
i 'm going to show you the little cheese toasty.
i 'm going to serve this with can have soup with grilled cheese version.
anyway , my tomatoes were in the oven for about an hour and ten minutes and i just wanted to look at what i was saying.
'cause we put them in a slightly smaller pan you get all these incredible juices.
otherwise , the tomatoes would roast that 's great.
but you would n't get them to be kind of solved and juices to release.
it 's amazing now for me.
a bottle mozzarella a piece of bread.
i 'm good to go.
that would be supper, all on its own.
we 're going to do is going to put it in my blender now.
if you do n't have a powerful blender, i have been thinking for a long time, if i wanted to invest in a powerful like a good blender, and i 'm glad that i did.
because i use my blendtec constantly if we do n't have a powerful blender, you 're going to need to sift message, string the soup.
otherwise , the skins of the tomatoes are going to be left all over, now for me.
this one i kind of put it on the press is soup setting or whatever.
and it 's just pures smoother than i 've ever seen it before, and i do n't need to strain it.
because there 's nothing to strain.
but it 's completely up to you.
i 'm just going to try and get it all in here, without really making a mass could awesome.
and i 'm just going to turn this on an puree it lid on and off she goes boom i love that i do n't have to turn it off either is.
it , on some now it 's totally smooth.
you could serve this as is nice and thick for what i 'm going to do is going to pour this into my saucepan, turn this on not super high, and i 'm just going to some vegetable stock now.
obviously , i do n't want to get rid of all that.
so what i do is i kind of for my vegetable stock in there give it a swirl, and then you can just add as much stock.
is you liked make it as thick or thin as you like?
i usually add about a cup of vegetable stock, usually seems to be perfect for me.
but again, you could service as is you could send it out if you want to the world is your pick up my friend.
now as well like a little splash in there now.
but i 'm going to serve with this is a little cheese toasty.
i 've got here.
is a couple slices of these are just holding back yet 'cause that 's just what i buy one of my favourites?
what i 'm going to do is it just cut on a diagonal kind.
really , as large as i could.
so i 'm going to get some nice big pieces.
the term a little skillet on.
i 'm going to anybody.
little skillet, here do n't turn it on too high, maybe, but medium low.
otherwise it will burn before that she 's going to get a chance to melt.
then , i 'm going to do first of all, let 's work on the outside.
take a little bit of butter and just kind of smear it on one side of each one 'cause that 's going to end up being the outside that 's going to get all nice and brown and then.
in addition to places and get all dirty.
take just that any bitty amount of basil pesto store bought homemade up to you.
i just use a tiny little bit on each side, not too much because it can bigger.
pass it can be a bit overpowering, and it 's got a lot of oil in there.
so you do n't want your end result to be super oily, then just a couple sizes this is just a block of mozzarella.
i had in the fridge sandwich just baby together like soul.
so it 's like a fancy grilled cheese and then just kind of keep it there until it gets beautifully colored on one side.
it 's got lovely color, and she is all melted and that 's it.
we 're going to do that, that 's going to happen at the same time, the soup is getting warm and be ready to go, look at that delicious creaminess.
no cream whatsoever just pure delicious tomato.
i 'm just i 'm.
so smooth, so creamy.
so let me give you, i 'm doing it so down, hyper enjoying time with you guys.
i do n't know what to lowering the kitchen to get the written recipe.
how we just bring them with me.
i 'm going to keep dunking in.
i 'll see you next time.
