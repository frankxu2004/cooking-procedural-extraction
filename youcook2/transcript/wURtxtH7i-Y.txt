call cannon is a classic irish dish, anna must have for any saint patrick 's day celebration and the great thing about it is that it is.
so easy to make traditionally it only has two ingredients.
potatoes , of course and your choice of either kale or cabbage.
let 's get started going to put about two pounds of peeled cubed potatoes into a saucepan, emergent potatoes with water.
and , bring to a boil.
bring it down to medium.
then , let them sit for about fifteen minutes or until tender, and while that 's happening.
let 's pry bar veggie.
i 'm using kale but feel free to experiment here.
you can use cabbage swiss chard, spinach pretty much any leafy green vegetable that you want.
but whatever you use you 're going to want to have about a pound of it, and you 're going to have it chopped keep in mind that if you are using caliph going to remove the steps.
you want just the leaves here.
and once that 's chopped, we transferred to a pot of boiling salted water for blanching going to let that boil for about five minutes, to make sure that the kill gets nice and tender again if you 'd like to have a little bit more flavor, feel free to add some veggies here have sometimes servants and green onion maybe a little bit of parsley, maybe some leaks, i 'm just showing you.
the basic recipe here.
now once detail has been blanched, we 're going to turn off the heat, and then remove the kill from the water with a slotted spoon, and from here you have a couple of options put the cal into the potatoes as is or you can do what i like to do which is pure aids with a little bit of butter now.
the choice, of course is entirely up to you.
but i find that pure rain.
it allows us to mix in more evenly with potatoes speaking in which those still have a few minutes left in the cooks.
so i 'm going to go ahead and do that set up set butter that is room temperature if you take it straight out of the fridge it will take longer to blend i know, good perfect time in, say, toes are fully cooked, which means that we 're going to get these drained and drive at the pan nobody likes water dunkel cannon once everything is as dry as possible we want to return the potatoes to the pots and add the kale if you 'd like a creamier consistency, add a little butter and milk to the mix season with salt and pepper to taste and start mashing and there you have it cold cannon, a quick easy, an incredibly versatile dish you can use this as a side or, if you feel.
so inclined, incorporate it into your banners and mesh or shepherds pie recipes, well, that 's all for me today from NBC storm watch this is daniel fischer wishing you happy cooking and a very happy saint patty 's day.
