today , i 'm showing you how to make some great tasting baked mussels inspired by one of my favorite japanese meals coming from sashimi seaweed salad, and of course, the back muscles.
so in terms of nutrition about three ounces of these just under hundred grams gives us sixteen grams of protein.
not as high as some of the other meats out there.
but it 's nice to get some very protein sources from time to time, plus with the sodium content in.
here is make for great pre-workout treats, so you can always pair this with another great quality source of protein fish.
maybe three four ounces of cod or halibut plus piece on the side taste great.
people tend to stay away from foods that they 're not too familiar with they just need to look at the nutritional fact of muscles, you can see just how complex they are in all of the minerals zinc magnesium or the essential an electrolyte minerals that we need regardless where they were training or not just to keep them chopped out within our bodies.
so that 's another reason why it 's great to vary your protein sources.
and if the nutritional facts are n't enough to get you to try these muscles, just have to look at the qualities of other similar foods like oysters high in zinc, which is widely known as back.
it 's the zinc that gets around to certain parts of your body and catchy, fired up so a nice batch of these in our first date.
going , to go down, much better than usual check in or turkey, or some other fish.
trust me a winner that moving on with the source yes these contains some.
what i call following ingredients.
but really they 're not too hard to find especially in the large bigger supermarkets that we often find in city centres.
first , i 'm going to start with, is this, this is japanese mayonnaise is half a bottle there.
so that 's our japanese mayonnaise that were pulling in not afraid that you might think goes well with a healthy dish.
but like i said, this is kind of a bit of a break from the norm to healthier.
treat me other than the ones you 're going to get in the restaurants, and it 's also going to help with that testosterone boosting factor along with the zinc in the muscles here.
next , up we 're going to add this, this is saracho hot chili source, otherwise known as cock source and use a very conservative amount in here.
so probably no more than a TSP know bit more, because this really is hot stuff mixed up i 'm going to add some chili garlic source.
many about half a tablespoon or really a teaspoon in there like our chili sauce here.
it 's a great thermogenic.
it 's going to naturally increase our bodies rate burning enerji at rest.
so there you go if you do n't like the fact that it 's got mayonnaise in there.
add a little bit more of the chili and hot sauce in there, to really spice things up next up.
i 've got about a tablespoon of fish eggs here or row.
great source of protein in there as well.
so all the time we 're adding extra kind of variance of protein to go with the muscles there, going to add a squeeze of lemon in there again.
you do n't have to this is n't a traditional japanese restaurant.
but hey, i like mushrooms.
so they 're going in just be sure to cut them pre finally going to die stem.
so to whole mushrooms, their add that into the mixture and last thing.
i 'm gonna use a fresh clover, garlic.
first of the ends remove the skin instead of chopping this onaiza garlic.
crusher smell is really science come together with all of those different unique ingredients in there so take our fork or whisk and makes altogether now.
let 's take our tablespoon, keep up a good amount and then just put down to the top of our muscles like that.
we 're going to save the seaweed salad to go on top decoration, plus to add to that taste and aroma.
so here we go up muscles about to be baked.
they 're going in the oven, which has been preheated to three hundred and seventy five degrees.
fahrenheit going to put these in for about fifteen eighteen minutes until it just starts to harden on the top.
so keep an eye after about twelve minutes.
four so just over fifteen minutes in the oven, and that was set at three hundred and seventy five degrees fahrenheit we.
now have our bait muscles.
so you 're going to be hard.
but let me just pull a few out onto the plate.
so i said three ounces.
we 're looking at about fifteen sixteen grams of protein, probably about four muscles in total, so double that is taking up to six ounces.
that 's about eight oysters so pretty decent.
serving there almost thirty grams of protein, plus with the extra ingredients.
we throw in there looking at thirty, thirty three grams.
not bad at all.
so i 'm going to finish up by putting some of our seaweed salad on top there.
we go are colorful concoction of japanese inspired high protein dish.
give it a try.
