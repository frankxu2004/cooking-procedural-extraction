hey guys, it 's friday night and some of you might be out at a positive, you are usually the special on a friday night, is fish and chips classic?
and this is my take on beer battered fish, and chips now.
camera guy, come over here and have a look at this.
i 've got some nice golden brown beer battered fish and chips with my homemade tartar sauce.
aside of green peas, and some french fries and a drizzle.
some lemon juice, on that ready to serve.
so if you want to know how to make this stick around in this episode of cooking in HD i 'm making beer battered fish and chips , well.
let 's start with our tartar sauce.
the main ingredients for tartar sauce will be about a cup of mayonnaise.
the juice of half a lemon.
and got some sweet gherkins here finally chopped also finally chopped some yellow onion use about a tablespoon or two of capers and for something a little bit different, i 've got some pickled onions.
and i 've missed that into this bowl right here.
i 'm going to mix everything together, right now.
that 's all mixed in.
let 's give it a taste here.
nice bite number of sweetness tanginess.
it 's got our sauce alright.
let 's go over our ingredient list.
i 've got five cod filets here.
these were previously frozen, you can get fresh ones all the better, but that 's just what happened to have.
i 've got a plate here with just plain all purpose flour in it.
i 'm going to use that to dredge the cod filets in.
and then in here i 've got one cup of flour, half a cup of cornstarch and half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and to that.
i 'm going to add here.
this is a slimming cream ale.
it 's a canadian beer.
it 's good, i like it, and i 'm going to dump the whole three hundred and fifty five mil bottle into here and what i 'll be looking for, is the consistency of something like pancake batter, no windows are beer.
now this is cold.
that 's kind of important because that means that we wo n't get lumps.
i 'm gonna start to whisk this fully incorporate everything right now check out the consistency.
it 's very much like pancake batter, which is what i 'm looking for.
and i 've just added a little bit of salt and not adding pepper.
because i 've got cayenne pepper in there that 's going to give us just a little bit of heat.
so this is just the right consistency, and i 'm going to OK.
so i 'm going to take my first piece of card and what i want to do here is i 'm just coding it in the flower and try to just use one hand.
because this is kind of make it dry and then the.
next step i 'm going to make it wet by putting it into the beer batter, and i 'm gonna use my other hand for that going to cover it with my beer batter, and once i 've got it nice and covered.
take it over to my frying pan, and just drop it in.
it 's the next one OK.
so this hand for dry, throw it in the beer batter and then this hand for the web, and i like a lot of beer batter online.
so i 'm just going to actually covered right so.
these are done.
let me show you.
what they look like i ai n't.
got nice golden brown color on there.
so i 'm going to plate these.
but first i 'm going to put him on a paper towel plates just to let the grease run off, and then we 'll play them.
and i 'll show you what the final product looks like, OK.
so here 's what the final product looks like i 'm serving it with french fries.
some green peas.
and i 've got two filets on there.
and this is my homemade tartar sauce.
you can see the nice golden brown batter on them.
and then i 'm just going to take this lemon, drizzle it on top and it 's ready to serve.
so this is my beer battered cod.
fish filets served on a friday, and i 'm looking forward to having this with glass of mice luminale cheers.
