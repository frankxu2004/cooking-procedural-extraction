hello , ladies and gentlemen, this is chef grew from groos, cooking dot com with punjabi, chana, masala.
i have here with me two cups of channel, which is also called cobley channel.
we have spoke this in six cups of water and kept this for eight hours to suck after eight hours, will pressure cook this shiners which are also called cobley channel in a pressure cooker along with the six cups of water and a pinch of baking soda, baking soda makes your channels even softer.
and it behaves like a tenderizer.
so if you see if i can hold, and grab one of these channels in my hand and try to squeeze them the easily squeeze in between my fingers will keep this china and the water aside will use both of them later on for the time being will take a car high in this cry will be adding four tablespoons of the AC guy, or clarified butter drop.
one inch of cinnamon stick keep cooking at a low flame, and now we 'll add, please.
followed by two black cardamom and one star anus, will add three clubs and one teaspoon of jira or khuman seeds when the jela, splatters will be adding two large onions that have been finely chopped.
and now if you wish you may increase the flame from low to medium, high.
it 's time we saw these onions along with these whole spices that we 've added and like i said, i prefer guy for this recipe, you may also use vegetable oil or canola oil in case, you do not have key at that instance of time will add one teaspoon of salt, adding salt at this time accelerates the process of cooking the onions and will also drop in one teaspoon.
large teaspoon of ginger garlic paste, the ginger here is seventy percent.
in the ginger garlic paste, and the obvious garlic, that is available is thirty percent.
so we 'll software this all these mixtures along until the raw flavors.
the raw aroma of the ginger garlic paste walked through the air and your onions turn golden brown so you really have to cook this pretty, well, otherwise.
your chili marcella will not three days good will now had three finely chopped green chilies for some spicy and hardness and we 'll sort of them.
along with the ginger garlic paste and the onions.
after a few minutes will add three chopped tomatoes now, usually in my recipes.
i show you things which are pretty quick.
so the onions and the ginger garlic paste and all these things that we cooked already takes approximately around five to six minutes, which i just showed in my video for around, you know, one or two minutes.
so , please do not follow the time of the video.
you take your own time.
the video is cut short and edited a lot of times the ladies and gentlemen.
after adding the tomatoes, they will split a lot of liquid onto your hands onto your poms into the air lower the flame.
now and in fact, will be adding a few spices as well.
so it is well recommended.
you lower the flame at this instance of time and let 's add a few spices now.
we 've already added a lot of garam, masala in hole.
so now will add half a teaspoon of garam, masala.
only we 've already added one teaspoon of salt will add one teaspoon of salt again.
so total it is two teaspoons of salt in this recipe.
we had one and a half teaspoon of coriander powder.
one teaspoon of red chili powder and one teaspoon of dry ginger powder, which is also pronounced as stoned in hindi.
how do you pronounce that so, and so when you say that TH your tongue touches your a upper lip?
so they all this together and remember, we 're still cooking at a low flame.
so mix everything, well, a nice pretty well, and the best way as i always say to cook the tomatoes is to cover it with a lid leave it for five to seven minutes at a very low flame, said back relax, and then, let this team do all the magic.
it 's been seven minutes now and let 's see what the status is.
so here you have all the G of wafting up at the surface.
it 's been oozing out of the tomatoes, which means the tomatoes have.
now cooked well along with the massage that you added.
so will just give it a gentle mix for a minute.
now and now, we 'll add in a few more spices will add half a teaspoon of carom seeds or a drain.
this is very good for digestion.
andy chan, are actually creates gas to some people, so this is a good thing that you can add.
also , for the soreness will add two teaspoons of pomegranate seeds powder, which is also called an ordinal, if you remember we had only three tomatoes and that was the reason.
because we 're going to add a lot of what do you call spices which will add to these arness of this recipe.
one of them being pomegranate seeds or the another, now that we just added in towards the end.
we also will be adding dry mango powder, which is unsure.
but not right now.
in the end now, what will do is will add that chile or china water that you had saved you boil this china in the pressure cooker.
so we 'll add this it is healthy.
and it is very good.
so probably, please do n't discard this water, keep it along with you.
and now we add this, if i try to steer this along with all the muscles that we 've been preparing since long, long time you will see that we are having no chunks of masala in here which is a good thing.
let 's see, that so here if you observe it 's too good.
we do not have any chunks or lumps of masella being formed here.
and if that is, the case, then you 'll be adding those beautiful cabuli channels that you had boiled look at them.
so , gorgeous like pearls in a cup.
let 's add these gently.
pour them down, this see there.
it goes and of course.
now the most important step everything that you have prepared in the form of masala has been incorporated along with the channel, otherwise it will not be called.
when jobby, chana, masala, so mix it up pretty well, at this instance, you can increase the flame slightly to medium and keep mixing it.
the best way to cook this is to let it relax by covering with the lid, lowering the flame once again and then, cooking it for around at least eight to ten minutes.
at a very, very low flame, and once again let this team do the magic, and you relax.
so before we do that i forward one important thing will add one teaspoon of kasoori, methi, which is also called drive into greek leaves, and the way.
we had, this is by holding it in between your palms and crushing it nicely.
and , that is the way you add it, so you should never drop it directly.
you should just crush it in between your palms and then added like this, this time.
we cover it with a lid, please lower the flame at this instance and let it cook for at least eight to ten minutes.
and it 's been eight to ten minutes.
now let 's observe what the status is.
so , almost all of the liquid has dried up.
you do n't have to, you do n't have to dry all the liquid in this.
there should be a little amount of moisture and that is, how it works.
because if you make it total dry, then it becomes the other recipe which is up indy channel.
and of course, now will add the half teaspoon of dried mango powder, which is also called amateur in the end and their office for another sarnese there.
and a tanky effect to your punjabi, chana , masala.
so like i said, you should not dry up all the liquid in this.
otherwise it will taste like the pindi, chana recipe, which also is available on my website.
let 's focus our camera and see what we have.
some delicious, nice.
there this is the.
time , ladies and gentlemen that you can put off the flame love the china masala on a platter along with some chip, arthies stopped over with addressing off onion rings and a lemon, which thank you.
