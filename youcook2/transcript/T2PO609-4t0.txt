hi guys were going to be cooking.
today is in english classic bangers and mash.
some stock, some potatoes, strong potatoes for the mashed potato, on in that 's for the only in gravy, and some bangers.
now guys make sure that you use english bangers, not italian sausage, i mean, you can.
but you wo n't have the same effect.
if you use proper english bangers and these are from my butchers start to get.
so i live in atlanta.
so it 's hard to get english bangers from around from so.
i 've got this bush is and needs it for me, so fantastic.
so let 's get started.
cool guys going to saute pan, add some olive oil and what we 're going to do is going to brown this sausages off.
everything is over that 's what you want flight out.
so , these brandon each side so will take him out.
so guys, i 've taken this sausages out and what 's left.
is this goodness you 've got the olive oil, you 've got the fat from the sausages and that will flavor the gravy beautiful.
so guys were going to make the only in gravy now?
so what you gotta do is slice one onion.
OK guys, wanna cook, these until the nice and brown about fifteen minutes so keep serums for the nineteen, caramelize and that will further stocking.
hey guys as you can see these are at about fifteen minutes and the nicely brown, and softened salaam.
do , and i had a little bit of flower just to give you some body a pinch?
and we 're going to cook that out about one minute just to get rid of that green in US and this will give a nice body on the gravy.
we do n't want the gravy, too thick.
how long my gravy a little running, it 's up to you.
so we took that out one minute, and then we 'll add this stock in had the stock next up the beer.
OK guys about this talk about the beer and what we 're going to do is going to bring that up to a boil and then we 're going to reduce it for about five minutes.
what else i 'm going to put in the gravy and some nice age.
so i 'm going to shifu nod to sage roll it up, and lightly slash it.
and some nice tell me a flat leaf parsley.
is roughly chopped coarsely good OK guys?
the grave is being reducing for about five minutes, with took off the heat.
one woman had is some sage.
some parsley, just earth.
next , we have the sausages and this will make the sausage is very nice and tender and also give the gravy a nice flavor cooking with the sausages, and we 're going to put that in the oven OK that goes into three june the seventy five degree oven about fifteen minutes.
big eyes much potato very, very simple.
i 'm going to be cooking my potatoes with the skins on a lot of goodness in that skin and also make sure that you cooked potatoes in big chunks rather than small chunks.
so they look like that OK guys when you are done boiling potatoes, make sure your pan, pan is going to be big, make sure you 've got plenty of water minds about three quarts, up there.
and also add a pinch of salt.
a lot of people do n't put enough water in when the boiling potatoes, then generally skinny potatoes jump on demand, OK guys about halfway through the cooking process just turned get bangers over.
then put back and the other look at that guys absolutely fantastic as you can see, you 've got the gravy, a beautiful consistency, not too thick not too thin.
the sausages are nice intended cooked in with the gravy and also the sausages are flavored that gravy too, which is absolutely beautiful.
look at that beautiful that 's the consistency that you want, i mean, it 's personal preference, but you do n't want too thick.
that 's nightless summer taste of this, and it taste the sausage in the gravy.
and that 's very important.
you got the caramelizing onions in there, which is really nice, so let 's get on with the mashed potato.
OK guys much potato, these are being drained.
and then i put him over the pop just to get that excess water out and then we 're going to put him in the part and then going to match him.
i have my masha and do me a favor.
do n't do much potatoes in a mixer always mushroom with russia, so, let 's just mushroom?
gently , and you do n't want to match him too much.
OK , once they 've been mashed, add some butter.
what is personal preference, so i like butter, and then use a wooden spoon?
and this what makes them the.
potatoes , very fluffy.
so , just generally, do a mister OK, do n't be afraid to put too much salt in, because potatoes love song.
it 's very odd to hoover season basalt at this age, given a gentle stir.
big guys next time at him milk.
just to get it smooth just like a little bit.
so as a little bit of milk father and generalist do n't over stir mashed potatoes.
so they go guys, bangers and mash.
give it ago guys.
you 'll love it.
