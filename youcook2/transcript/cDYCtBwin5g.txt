welcome back once again to how to cook great food dot com.
if you have n't already please subscribe to our channel, OK, some falafel on the menu today, these are absolutely wonderful.
i 'm really pleased with how these have come out.
they 're really nice and light and fluffy absolutely, delicious less conduit, OK.
so let 's get started on this version of falafel, like i said that there were many, many different ways of making it lots of people with different bits and pieces in this is our version.
but some garlic there for the amount of armories about four hundred grams, five hundred grams of cooked chickpeas.
so i 've got about two or three cloves in there, but just it.
how you want i 'm put in some red onion, some people use why i 'm using red.
and then here i 've got a whole load of it 's actually.
this is coriander and parsley.
you can put one in or you can do.
i 've done and put both in and then going to adjust a little splash of olive oil to help is on its way we 're going to blend this together, then i 'll be back.
OK , so as you can see that 's been means nicely.
i 'm not going to go in with my cheek piece, which are nicely cooked and grab some salt some black pepper human powder for this amount.
i 've got like two, two teaspoons and two teaspoons of coriander powder, and then i 'm going to have some chili.
you could have officially one, i 'm not in a chili powder.
red chili powder, and they 're going to be fairly hot these ones.
that 's about a teaspoon and then again optional thrown in some system DCS.
now we need to add just a little bit of baking powder.
i 'm just sort of help them on their way when they 're cooking some people put flower in now.
i 'm not using flower today.
some people use baking soda entirely up to you and add a little more splash of oil again.
lot people do n't put any oil in, they might just had a little water.
we do n't want it to be too well.
i mean, we 're not making hummus here, because you make these shapes and then buy them off once again with it up sooner moment.
so you can see now.
i 've got this kind of consistency, little bit wet we certainly go on any wetter than this.
but it 's dry enough to us.
the mold into the shapes we want so that i 'm really happy with that, now, of course there if you 're more, chili add more chili.
you 're more human.
add more just get it.
how you want it.
there 's no real big rule here.
khuman , coriander, pretty important in this sparsely pretty important, but just play around kill it just, just how you wanted to rule some shapes and start cooking them.
OK , so as you can see what i 've done here i 'm just more disease into some different shapes.
these are the kind of small balls.
nice for snacks.
these are more your pattern for your burger.
they go nice inside your pizza bread or your covers with your salad, if you 're going to eat them like that, and that 's just a very sausage type thing more exactly how you want the.
next thing to do, is get some nice hot oil?
i 'm going to deep fry mine slightly unhealthy, but that 's how it 's done.
traditionally , you can bake these.
now if you want you can put that straight in the oven, on it 's on a metal dish and they will cook or you can sort just shallow fry.
then i 'm going for the deep fried sorry about that.
let 's go and do that, so i put my oily, i 'm using a sunflower oil anywhere.
you like, and as you can see i just dropped a little bit in just to see if the oil is why i think it is.
now the tricky pop.
this is a fairly delicate.
we 're going to drop them in that you do n't want your oil to be raging, raging horse 'cause they 're just really burn really quickly.
so i 've got a medium, medium bubble there as you can see, then they go and these are just going to take about two or three minutes.
there 's no need to touch them at this stage.
let him just do their thing.
just get this other one in there.
just make sure they 're not touching each other.
these are combat ready.
i 'm going to fish them out.
and i put him on some kitchen towel, beautiful color, i do n't cook them more than that quite happy with these.
so let me just cook those other two.
i 've got two larger ones that i showed you earlier looking one and then this, yeah, lovely, lovely color is it.
gonna be ready to eat, see in a moment, OK.
so there we go as you can see there lovely and crispy i 've got one here i 'm just broken open, nice and moist and beautiful inside which was perfect for me who serve in this, with some bread, and some china or tiny, which is a sesame E seed based hope you enjoy this, they 're really easy to make like, i say you can take them you can shadow, fight or do what i 've done deep firedome see you again soon bye , bye.
i forgot to mention that uhm i just made this small amount.
but the amount that we made in the mix up is enough to make you know, i could make another twenty more of these fellows.
there 's plenty there.
i 'm going to try again later.
