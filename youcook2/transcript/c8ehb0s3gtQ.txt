the kentucky beef council, an kentucky living magazine, proudly present executive chef doctor michael rigs for the lean beef, cooking demo, good evening, am i doing good OK you off to good starts all i gotta do is keep the pace going what allison referred to is that we are going to a dish called beef, bergen young.
now if you 're in paris or france you call it boof and i made a mistake a couple of years in paris calling it before going.
i got some really bad looks from the waiter.
so i worked on that over the years, but beef bergen young is a peasant dish.
is history comes from the burgundy region of france, and just like in america, it comes from the concept of one pot cooking.
so the whole idea about is these dishes were created by cooking what was available at the time by the people?
what they had two and one of the things we talked about in culinary world is what grows together goes together.
so if you 're in a part of the world where they have beef an burgundy reason there, france is also known for his mushrooms, and it 's cheeses and its wines as well, it would make sense to use those ingredients to create this dish.
so it was a way of checking beef and cooking it for extended period of time in burgundy wine.
i have a sign above my kitchen that says i like cooking with wine.
sometimes i even put it in the food, so we 're going to start by sauteing some bacon.
you ca n't go wrong whether you 're in france or weather in bowling green bacons bacon OK.
so we 're going to tell you that one of the things we do we saute as we heat our pan first.
the reason you want to eat the pan first if you do n't want to put food into a cold skillet.
you want the skill to already be hot.
so we 're going to render the fat off of this.
basically , means we 're going to cook it a little bit and then we 're going to get it where we get the grease off of it.
then we 're going to do.
is when that 's.
done , i 'll pull that out and i will remove all the fat.
the grease, and i 'm not going to throw it away.
do n't worry, i 'm going to use it, it goes back into the dish so basically just warming this up now, the beef?
i 've got is kentucky proud because when i buy meat for our program i use a butcher on the bypass called the fatted calf.
ryan does a tremendous job when he does.
an , he uses all kentucky proud products.
he tries his best to get only meat from kentucky.
if you can still appreciate that kind of working with him on that, so that 's where i get mine.
so we 're going to pull this out, you know, this was n't dinner.
i 'd be looking for some breakfast right now someone put that back in there.
now i 'm going to say that at the same time, now, we 're going to take our beef, which is lean beef 'cause we do n't want a lot of fat content.
we got enough at with the bacon, kind of got that covered.
so we 're going to take that, and we 're going to lightly coat that in flower and the reason why i cut that flower is asking to keep it from sticking to the pan south 's gonna help sear in the beef.
now what happens when we put this back in, and this is where i had the bacon fat banking.
this is the good part is that, that 's going to start to stick to the bottom of the pan, and a few minutes once this just get slightly brown not going to cook this all the way.
because part of the process of making a good stew for those you like to make him is a long slow simmer right, gotta put in a bra.
so once we brown this, i will pull it back.
out for little salt and pepper on.
it , at that point.
because i want to flavor it.
but i do n't want to salt and pepper to burnout while it 's being brown i want to flavor it when i bring it back out.
we were moved around a little bit.
now all the good stuff is left in the bottom of the pan, when you 're done makes really good what the french call fonde it will be in the south col gravy.
OK , that 's the good stuff so we do n't.
wanna cook this long because it 's going to cook falling a recipe.
the first amount of time it cooks is a solid hour.
when it 's also emerged in this red wine that has garlic and tomato paste and margarine and all that kind of stuff that makes you wish she would cook faster.
but a good stew you have to cook the meat slow.
because you do n't want to overcook it, you really want to be very tender.
you really want that taste.
so i'ma pull that out normal sprinkle that with little salt and pepper without salt basically not going to taste anything else, all it gives everything a kick.
that 's what gets to start.
that 's why you find salt and all kinds of recipes, so here 's the bacon fat.
we 've been waiting for so we 're going to put that back in there, and i 'm going to start adding all the good stuff.
once you get everything started, this is a really simple dish.
this is the best part right here.
now i 'm going to add that tomato paste, and this is just steam coming off of there still.
hot weather is just being so that was kind of hot.
little marge ram in there.
we 're going to let that cook.
so , we got semantic pace that 's mixed in with his burgundy wine that 's got bacon and bacon fat sounds kind of healthy.
done start with lean beef.
so we got the least lean beef, then cover now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to add baby carrots.
and i 'm going to add in pearl onions.
you can buy him this way, think about working on a farm anywhere in the country.
they 've got root vegetables here by plants to garden.
so these things are really available on regular basis.
so we 're going to get those cook for awhile and what we 're doing is that were pudding the root vegetables in first.
because they take the longest to cook once this is all cooking, then basically i set it on the side put atop in about an hour.
later , i 'm going to come back, OK, it 's going to thicken up cause that flower is now going to mix in with the wine and all.
the other flavors, net starts to create that thick sauce 'cause we use flour and culinary business to create what we call a room, which is thickening agent.
at this point act this is code for now.
and i 'm doing the fast forward thing here.
right case does n't have dinner with y'all, been sitting around watching whatever julia child 's cooking, and so i will come back and right before it 's done.
you can smell that, then i had the mushrooms, the mushrooms are not going to take about ten, or fifteen minutes, and i want to put a lid on this.
because it 's the student.
i want to trap that heat.
OK , this man is pretty good right here that.
and this is the five minute version versus.
the two hours, so from beginning to end.
it 's about an hour and forty five minutes.
maybe two hours and the thing about a good burger yawn is.
if you have a glass of burgundy loaf of hard french bread, you 're good to go 'cause you can buy it on this taken.
stop up the grave where i grew up in carolina.
that 's what you did you stop.
i hope you enjoyed your boof.
bergen home, thank you.
