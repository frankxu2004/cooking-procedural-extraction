david bailey value.
retire from the police force three years ago and have been farming snails ever since and at least now.
they 've got here altogether.
this place can do two and a half times a year.
it 's labor intensive.
i never, i can spend five to six hours a day in here.
i will use several hundred gallons of water every day in here.
wall david works his ass offering the little buggers at a rate of a quarter of a million a year.
he 's wife more can barely make enough garlic butter to keep up.
i never had a british now.
yet , you know, that i 've always been using the french here.
you go, i 'm amazed, the texture.
the flavor, and i have to say they do taste just as good as the french in a way that there they 're not sweeter.
we 've got no reason to be squeamish about the memory to do is sort of, i mean, you see that gun.
so you should leave them, which is crazy, well, people put slug pellets down and poison them and what have you and then go to a restaurant and order half a dozen.
and , and pay a lot of money for that when they can eat.
what 's in their garden the snails david farms at the same variety of those found in your garden.
now , there 's clearly millions of, millions of farm snails, but what excites me more than anything.
the fact you can actually eat the snails from your back garden and obviously eating things that are wilder file taste here from a share point of view than something farmed.
now rumor has it, they like coming out in the wet, hence, the reason why i 'm fucking water the garden for the first time ever.
so we give you five pence personnel if you find them again.
yeah , but the thousands more i want the bucket up today fifteen pence one twenty five you ca n't eat garden, snails immediately.
you need to ensure any talks.
is they may have consumed or purged from their system for the first two days, leave this now without any food and regular?
wash them on day three.
give them a card and leave them for a couple of days until you see their droppings turn orange.
finally , wash nails again and place him in the fridge in a sealed container.
the cold will send them into a deep, deep sleep say goodbye to these little buggers and send them in there for a bath.
what frustrates me now when you see these in the pan is a faggot.
i pay a fortune for snails and there 's sort of free range wild organic snails from southwest of france.
the fact i 've got all these nails in my bloody back garden and i 'm not paying a penny for them.
we can finally say goodbye to the french drain get your tweezers and pick entail now.
look at a small sweet and beautiful right, where these snails now.
i want to sort of up the tempo little bit.
and yes, there wild and the from the back garden, and they look delicious.
but i want to get away from that garlic butter.
so this is the most amazing sort of smoked and chatter i think on the verge.
now discovering the most amazing delicacy yes from fucking ones worth, the fresh sage snails in.
so to them.
now to finish this now, then was n't fresh pasta in their fresh lemon juice, a little bit of all, of all that.
now is ready for salad, the salad lightly dressed.
because that 's been a big problem with snails that been heavily doused with lots of garlic butter.
i want to keep it nice and light and it smells amazing.
the sage got really nice.
sort of sweet spicy flavor and the crispness of the bacon, and he got really nice.
fresh lemon, juice squeezed.
