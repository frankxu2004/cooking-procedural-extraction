hey , you to be babies.
this is break in and cooking, again today i will be cooking, southern style.
macaroni and cheese with a twist because of any bread crumbs on top, so, let 's get started.
first , i 'm going to boil, some water as you can see our addison 's fault, and i 'm adding some olive oil.
OK , now i 'm put my noodles in, and you gonna cook them to the ogden tank, which what the package to lose.
it was six minutes so you can go buy a package, or you can be ghetto and country again won the noodles and throw it on wall.
and if it sticks its old intake, i know i 'm, i 'm brilliant, but that 's how it should look OK.
i have my three cheeses right here.
i have some coffee.
jack chatter and some velvet.
now , i have some heavy cream now.
have about three cups?
i 'm going to be adding today, and i 'm going to add my house, seasoning as you guys can tell me, if you want to know what 's in my house season seasonings just look down below.
and i will tell you guys with some side.
all that seasoning OK.
now i 'm going to add three eggs to this OK.
now you guys, you do not have to use heavy cream you can use milk.
but i wanted to use heavy cream, because i wanted to do it, you know, the real fat anyway, because macaroni cheese is not supposed to be healthy.
OK , you guys, just because i had lap band, do n't mean i do n't get down and eat unhealthy food?
so i 'm kind of mix all this stuff together and like.
so and also you guys, i did at sour cream i did not show that.
but yes, i added about not a cup of sour cream today, and i have some pepper right there.
i have any.
some pepper smoked paprika right there.
OK , you gotta smoke pep rica.
and i 'm going to mix, excuse me for using a plastic utensil, but i 'm a firm believer in not trying to mess up.
so many bitches.
because i am a mess you cook.
so , i try not to use all, but i 'm going to add my cheeses to that.
so , although the milking caesars and is n't gonna add all that cheese today, and i 'm going to mix.
so just continue to watch what i 'm about to show you.
next is pretty much self explanatory.
i 'm just going to be mixing all his teeth together with i 'm just going there and it alright to just eighteen.
now you guys, i did have to add some milk.
because i kinda made too much.
so i had a little milk.
but like i said, this is plymouth twenty months self, explained from this company, mixing everything together, only states, yes at the agrees, not pans a little bit of butter, and i 'm putting some butter through my noodles.
so they wo n't be.
so sticky, sticky together.
it just made see how is that.
all together again.
now i 'm gonna add all that stuff that i mixed together just put all of it now.
i could put all this in a large bowl.
but i do n't have one at the moment.
so i had to do it this way, but i would prefer mixing all this in a large bowl.
then put in your cooking dish would have been a.
comically , that 's how she looked, and i am adding some of my house seasons on top and some output somewhere smoked pep rica on top of there, too, with , will.
i got some cheddar cheese.
and i 'm going to sprinkle a little bit on the top, just like he asked a little bit on top.
i would have put a lot more, but i was n't thinking that i put in bread crumbs on top of it 'cause i was gonna add more cheese.
what is another?
but i forgot a bit bread crumbs with, i use, texas, toast return for season, seasoning current.
yes , honey, this is, is so good?
oh , my god.
but i 'm going to beat it all, together.
like so this puts out a lot of anything and i 've got some milk with butter real butter , yell.
and you gotta mix, melted butter and the bread crumbs together.
it kind of to still toast the bread crumbs on top and i had, had to add a little bit more.
a step bread frozen every what i 'm telling.
it smells so freaking good when i was mixing together so good.
but you gotta put those bread crumbs on swap, like so, so you guys are you feel like cheese and talking.
i was n't thinking, i was put bread crumbs on top.
i was not thinking RX, the brain frontal stopping, i was like forgetting.
there 's enough cheese in there, but you, gotta, add all over you.
gotta , pretty feature of into three fifth.
and , that is how it looks with me with completely done.
does n't look for chips.
i had this in the oven, for about forty minutes, what about menton guys.
look how good this stuff, but it was so cheesy and he and those bread crumbs like really, really did the job out.
those bread crumbs, croutons or the bomb.
so i 'm going to cut into the gym to show you guys how it look he saw the cheese.
yes , honey chow.
yes , but you said big lump in bellevue right.
now comfortable teacher.
but that 's how i must, you guys and this is all we ate and just take the macaroni and cheese, yasin do n't be chuckle building.
but like i say, you do n't have to add all those cheeses, you can add whatever kind of cheese you want.
but that velveeta is like the secret.
because it gives you that creamy sensation of a macaroni and cheese.
but just marinate knowledge all this background speech, was.
