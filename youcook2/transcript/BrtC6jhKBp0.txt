is it taste funky, audie start over again?
steamy , my god, tiny kitchen today, i 'm going to show you how i cook in my small dry kitchen, which is a kitchen without running water we 're going to be making egg fried rice with pork two cups of water boiling in our pan we have two cups white rice, i already rinsed this for eggs.
some canola oil, some soy sauce chicken fat, fresh onions that i just cut for my garden.
now i only have one clove of garlic on me right now.
so that 's what i 'm going to be working with, but i would use for if you have it at home.
he got some water boiling here, and i put two cups of pre rinsed white rice as well as two tablespoons of vegetable oil in there.
so well, the rice is cooking, i 'm going to show you guys how i easily cut garlic, and the only thing you need is a chefs knife and a pair of clean scissors.
i just chop the bottom off, take the side of my knife.
and i 'm going to press into it.
take the skin off, and now i have a piece of garlic as you can see it 's already kind of.
it 's all like separated.
i 'm going to put that over my frying pan, and i 'm going to cut that about five times, probably.
the worst part of living in a dry cabin is doing dishes.
so i 've learned a lot of easy tricks to avoid making as many dishes as possible.
this saves you dishes it saves you time.
i take my clean scissors.
so after you cut the pork in districts, you 're going to cut it into cubes.
now that we have our pork cut we 're just going to put two tablespoons of canola oil in with our garlic, and we 're going to let that start frying once that garlic is nice and aromatic you 're going to take your pork and add that in it just dump that on in there we 're going to add some peppers as you can see the pork is.
now cooked are eggs cracked and put in the bowl fact and put in the bowl you 're gonna gently mix these together, just to combine the yolk with the whites.
but not enough, to add air you do n't want to make this like fluffy scrambled eggs about two tablespoons of soy sauce there a nice helping of pepper pour contents of your eggs into the pan.
once you start seeing that the bottom of your eggs has began cooking.
turn the heat back down a bit, you 're going to start rolling your pan.
so just rolling it.
like so, so.
yes , just make sure all the edges pop up like that.
it 's just like a big egg pancake very, very gently going to score your eggs.
the way i was taught as you make your eyes a day, ahead.
i do n't do that.
so that 's that so with all the main components cooked and ready to go we 're going to eat up our pan.
add a bit of canola oil wash my scissors, after i cut the pork, and.
now i 'm going to just cut my green onions and said this canola oil, and then i just put my rice in there rendered chicken, fat, and i 'm going to add soy sauce.
i would start with about two days soon and just get connected, now add some pepper.
unfortunately , while i was frying the rice, the camera stopped recording.
i do n't even know how to explain it.
so the last two steps you add the eggs and the poor can cook for another five minutes for my tiny kitchen to yours.
