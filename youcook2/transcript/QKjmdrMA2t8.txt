hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with the world 's fastest meatballs.
i 'm going to show you an incredibly fast.
no chop meatball mixture, but wait, that 's not all not only is this a note chapa, meatball recipe.
it 's an oh roll meatball recipe and yet with all those shortcuts had still incredibly delicious, and this is how you make it OK.
so , the best part about a note shop meatball recipe is the node shopping part.
so you 're just going to take some ground, beef and ground veal is any combination of beef, veal and pork.
so i crumble that in a bowl and then it is small bowl i 'm going to take some plain bread crumbs i 'm going to add some milk.
one whole egg, some dry italian herbs have a little touch of granulated garlic little splash of olive oil abig pinch of red pepper flakes, and then we 're going to mix that together with a whisk by the way, instead of calling this.
the wet breadcrumb mixture.
we call it a slurry is shorter, and sounds more official.
so when you 're slurries, mix set that aside and it 's back to the bowl of meat this season would salt black pepper, and for me just a little pinch of white pepper and if you do n't have it, that 's fine after the salt and pepper.
i 'm gonna add some parmesan cheese.
the real stuff from parma italy or at that point.
you 're going to transfer your slurry mixture into the meat bowl and you 're going to give it a good mix.
and for my next trick, i 'm going to turn a wooden spoon into a rubber spatula in three two alright.
we 're going to mix that together, stop worrying about overmixing this meatball recipe is indestructible, saying intentionally over mix.
it , but once it 's mixed stop, so right there, i 'm good.
i 'm going to stop and begin to shape the meatballs.
but before we shape, i 'm going to need you to line a baking sheet with some aluminum foil.
and then brush it lightly with oil and then for the most time consuming step in making meatballs.
the rolling, except we 're not going to roll, we 're going to scoop besides being fast because it 's no chop.
this method uses a scoop instead of rolling.
so you 're just going to take one of these small sorbey scoops they sell, AM at every kitchen supply store in this, you can scoop a whole tray like that in about five minutes and you 're going to get the same basic shape except they 're going to have extra nooks and crannies, which is an advantage, or ask anybody that slices sandwich mean surface area equals flavor.
so i know there are a little rough around the edges in fact, i have like a pet nickname for my call these my rough riders, and yes, i 've heard through the grapevine that DMX is not happy about that.
but that 's another story and this method really does save a tremendous amount of time.
so we 're going to scoop all that out it should fit on one sheet tray once there scoop we have to brown them should be a time consuming step some people fries some people bake we 're going to go even faster we 're simply going to brown those under a hot broiler.
it 's going to take like half the time, the baking or frying would and as soon as they are browned you 're done now.
i did n't buy feel free now, ideally, is your meatballs were browning you already had a pot of pasta sauce on the stove?
already hot answer your meatballs in, and as soon as that comes back to a simmer you 're ready to eat, so, if your sauce is already hot start to finish you can do this recipe in about thirty five forty minutes.
and of course, if you have an extra fifteen twenty minutes maybe a half hour let the meatballs simmer in the sauce a little bit.
it 's only going to make the sauce more flavorful.
so , do n't worry about overcooking the meatballs or give them getting tough?
not going to happen.
and , you know, how this story ends right, we put it over spaghetti, we topped with some extra parmesan, and we dig in we go.
but these were really good, a fabulous plate of spaghetti and meatballs of course, it 's not going to be as epic is the traditional methods.
but it 's not supposed to be this is like a week night.
you 're craving spaghetti and meatballs.
but you do n't have hours and hours to spend this is a great alternative.
so hope you give it a try head over to food wishes, dot com for all the ingredient amounts, well, as usual, and as always enjoy.
