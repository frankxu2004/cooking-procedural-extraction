time to make a slow cooked bag meal that is packed full of flavor and is ridiculously simple to prepare.
let 's make a slow cook beef goulash on the one pot chef.
the beauty of this recipe is that it 's just fantastic slow cooking.
you literally chuck everything into the pot.
give it a stir switch.
it on and walk away first things.
first , i 've got a kilogram of beef.
i 'm using a cheap cut of beef today.
i 'm using some gravy beef.
and we 're just going to check that straight in about sort of five centimeters or about two inch pieces next.
i 'm heading into small brown onions, which i 've just diced up.
give that a quick stir around you can brown the beef first in a fry pan if you want to.
but i find with slow cookers like this.
it 's completely unnecessary.
because you do n't really need to lock in the juices becaus it 's being cooked on a low heat for a long time and.
so you do n't end up getting that moisture loss that you would get if you 're cooking, this in the oven, or over the stove.
next time adding in a four hundred gram tin of diced tomatoes.
two tablespoons of tomato paste or concentrated tomato puro, two tablespoons of sweet paprika.
now this is sometimes called hungarian paprika.
so it will just have to look for it, it will be in the spice aisle in your supermarket, half a cup of beef stock and half a cup of water season with a little salt and some pepper that a good stir together.
that 's a cool ass ready to go.
so we just put the lid on.
and we 're going to cook this for eight hours on low or four hours on high.
but i highly recommend cooking it for the eight hours on low as i find the beef becomes a lot more tender and beautiful with a much lower and lower cooking time.
but feel free to do the quick version if you short on time.
eight hours later, and.
let 's take a look cool steam that 's looking gorgeous that sources thickened up and that mate is looking lovely and tender that 's beautiful look at that yum now.
there 's just one last thing to do.
now this is entirely optional.
but i 'd like to add in a nice.
a blob of sour cream just before serving.
and we stir that through and it gives us a.
lovely , thick creamy effect.
i cannot wait to have a taste of this, and here we have our completed slow cooked beef goulash.
and i 've just serve this with a bit of rice, but of course, you could serve this with pastor with vegetables mashed potato pretty much.
anything you like piping hot and ready to eat this beef is literally falling to pieces.
i 'm just using a fork and it 's just falling to pieces, so i cannot wait to have a taste of this hum.
those , so tender off so much flavor in there.
you 've got the tomato, you 've got the capsicum, or the bell peppers.
you got that onion and that garlic, oh, it 's absolutely amazing.
and it 's so simple to prepare, i mean, you literally check everything into the pot and switch it on ca n't get simpler than that.
well , i hope you enjoy this recipe.

that 's perfect for summer, and even better for winter.
