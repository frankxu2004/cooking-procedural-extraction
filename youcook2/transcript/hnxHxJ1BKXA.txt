hi , i 'm dying cometa, antidaeon dishes would die.
i 'm going to show you how to make corndogs.
these are a carnaval, anfar, favourites, and there is so easy to make.
so , let 's get started until she would die.
so , whoever thought you can make corn dogs at home.
it 's pretty easy, actually, so what i have here is some cornmeal anne.
i 'm just leveling this off and make it a little bit of a mess, and i 'm going to put this into a large mixing bowl along with about the same amount of flour.
so we 're just going to pour this in.
so you want to measure them in the same way and then just level it ouf and put that into your bowl as well.
they have those two things and what we 're doing here is.
we 're making a nice batter that outside coding of the corn dog, which is sort of like a corn muffin, an with that, we 're going to have some leavening to make it kind of like puff, up a little bit.
and that 's going to be some baking powder, so go ahead and add that into your mixture.
and it needs salt so we have a nice balance of flavor and i 'd like to use a fine sea salt for this.
and it is nice to have a little bit of sugar in there.
so i 'd like to just use a little bit a little bit more and then go ahead and grab yourself a nice big fat whisk and wish that all together and get it really mix through thoroughly.
now grab yourself some milk, and then an egg put that together, and then grab your same wisc pop that in there, get that combine and then take that wet mixture and dump it right into the dry mixture.
just like this, really super simple.
and that 's it for the batter mix.
this through until it gets nice and smooth and thoroughly combined and.
now you 're just going to let this rest for about thirty minutes, at room temperature, and that 's going to give it a chance to come up to room temperature.
it 's going to give the flour and cornmeal a chance to absorb the milk.
and the egg, and it 's going to give the gluten.
so relax because by mixing it like that we kind of activated the gluten.
so we do n't want little tough corn dogs.
we want them to be nice and tender.
so we 're just going to let this sit, and while we do that we 're going to get our hot dogs ready.
now you 're going to need some all beef hot dogs or the hotdog.
oven your choice, so i took them out of the package.
i ran them under some water and then i patted them dry thoroughly 'cause you want them to be nice and dry.
so that the batter sticks to them.
so the first thing you want to do is get some bamboo skewers and you want to take the hot dog and put it right into the center.
so slide that all the way up there and then just do that to each one once the batteries been resting for about fifteen minutes, well, into a frying pan with high sides i 'm using a ten inch pan here, and you want to get it about an inch high heat that oil up till it reaches about three hundred and fifty degrees then, you want to grab yourself a nice big tall glass, or a jar, and you 're going to pour the batter into it grab your hot dogs and take a little bit of flour and put that on the plane with the hot dogs and dis lightly coat them with the flower, and this is going to help the batter stick to them.
brush off any excess, and take each hotdog and place it into the batter and give it a nice turn around.
and get it nice, encoded that any excess dripple off and carefully place it into the hot oil only cook about two to three hot dogs at a time use.
a pair of tongs to carefully rotate the dogs.
so that they brown evenly and cook them for about three minutes when they 're done carefully use your tongues and remove them from the oil and place them on a plate lined with some paper towels to drain and to cool.
and you can either serve them with a side of your favorite condiment, like i like yellow mustard or even some barbeque sauce.
or you can just take some mustard and this world, that right over it.
you could take your dog for a walk and it 's absolutely delicious, just like at the carnival.
so let 's give this baby, bite lately crisp from the outside.
it 's got that nice corn muffin taste a little bit.
sweet little bit, crisp, just perfect.
go and make these get the recipe dishes would die dot com, and i hope i made your life a little easier more enjoyable and delicious dove.
see you next time.
