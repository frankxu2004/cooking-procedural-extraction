hello , i 'm sumac man.
and i 'm cook created here for his weekly magazine, and i 'm going to show you how to make shepherds pie.
the first thing to do if the shepherds pie is to prepare the base.
so i 've got a tablespoon of light olive oil in the pan, and i 'm moving it up, and once i can feel it 's hot.
i 'm going to add to the pan two onions that i 've peeled and chopped and the most are going to add do parrots that her game peeled and shot and i 'm going to leave with cook on a medium heat for about five to seven minutes until the vegetables have softened a little bit.
so once the vegetables have softened, i 'm going to add to the perm five hundred grams of minutes, lamb and then i break this down with the spatulas.
so that it will cook evenly traditional shepherds pie was made using cooked lamb and it was a way of using up the meat after sunday roast dinner , said.
he wanted you could use cook lamb chop finely or men 's famous recipe.
but if you use cook lamb just cook it for a little bit less than i 'm doing though, so, once the meat is browned on all the surface days i 'm going to add a rounded tablespoon of plain flour and that will pick him up.
the juices that have come out of the lamb and then i 'm also them plaid two tablespoons of tomato puree, which will give us nice color, and about once two tablespoons of with fisher source and the saltiness to miss help for in half the flavor of the shepherds pie, and i also have two hundred milliliters of lamb stock, if you want to you could add a dash of red wine to this, which helps to give a nice flavor to it.
and i 'm also going to add about a tablespoon of chopped time.
so i 'm not going to leave this to simmer for about five minutes, so once i 've simmered the lamb.
i 'm now going to season it, and i like quite a loss of freshly ground black pepper.
but i 'm going to add just a little bit of salt because the worcestershire sauce is quite salty.
so i do n't want to make the recipe over salty, so i 'm going to mix that in.
and then i 'm going to spoon this into another proof bush now for the topping for this.
i 've got some mashed potato about a kilo of mashed potato, but when i 'm doing this at home i tend to use what other vegetables i have.
i think it 's really nice.
my favorite is a mixture of half potato and half past slip.
sometimes i do it with some carrot in it as well, so it makes it an orange colored mesh.
so any root vegetables even celeriac with the potato makes a nice mesh.
so i 'm going to spoon this on top just spreading it out.
so it 's totally covering them in slam.
i 'm just texturing the top very slightly.
and i 've got it on a baking tray.
because if any of the mixture boils out of the dish when it 's, in the oven, fall onto the baking tray rather than dirtying the bottom of the oven.
now this needs to be baked at a hundred and eighty degrees centigrade, which is gas mark.
and it takes about thirty to forty minutes or is ready.
when the top is nice and golden, and you can see the filling beginning to bubble up from around the edges of the potato.
so when the pie is ready, it should be nice and golden in the top.
this one has coupled out of it, so it 's a good job for to put it on the baking tray, and that 's already for serving.
so if i scoop some out onto a plate my favorite with this is fake beams.
i actually like them cones with it, but it 's also good to serve it with a salad, so that 's finished shepherds pie.
