so today we 're going to make generals chicken.
now i do n't care how you say it general to.
so , however, just i just call it generals chicken.
it 's not a traditional chinese dish, uh, there 's no doubt about that you start researching the history.
it 's very cloudy of where it came from, but it 's definitely not chinese in the sense that did not come from mainland china.
there 's a lot of sand thinking that it came from the US.
there 's also some claims that it came from taiwan.
but it 's a very popular chinese dish chinese whatever you want to call it dish, and i happen to like it, it 's one of, even know, one that it 's not real.
i still love it occasionally order it, but it 's hard to find a place that does it.
right there 's most of the buffet, places it really has no flavor.
it just taste sweet.
and there 's really nothing to it, it 's not done the way that it should be done, so anyway.
i 'm going to do it the way that i like to do it as you can see.
i 've got some chicken breast that i 've cut up.
i prefer to use thigh, but breast does taste really good.
done this way now.
i 've got some sesame E seeds that i 've lightly bruised up at half a tablespoon oh by the way, all the ingredients and the amounts are going to be listed under more info.
so if you look, under the box that you watching a video in and you 're going to see some information you 'll see a little thing that says more info.
you click that and it will open up a new box.
and it will show you all the ingredients in the amounts going to give us a mix just kind of get it on the chicken.
kind of spread it out a little bit.
now this is going to be a deep fried dish, not a, not a stir fry dish kind of thinking about maybe someday trying to stir fried just see how it turns out kind of curious about that will take a teaspoon of chinese cooking wine.
maybe a little more, if you do n't want to use alcohol.
you some water, or chicken stock or something like that, it will taste slightly different, but chances are most people will not notice a lot of people.
do n't want to use alcohol either feed into the kids or they have allergies.
or whatever, anyway, one teaspoon of soy sauce i 've gotta pinch of new mix.
'cause we gotta kind of.
layer , these things in saying a sauce.
we , gotta get certain ingredients on in certain orders here, we go.
i 've got a pinch of salt and a pinch of white pepper.
if you wanted amount that maybe eight of a teaspoon of each we 're going to give this a mix heavier.
i have two teaspoons of cornstarch going to give this a mix until we do not see any more white specks and it will let this marinade for fifteen minutes to half an hour or something like that, while we make our sauce.
and we do some other preparation work.
so let 's make her sauce.
i have a quarter cup of chicken stock.
i have one tablespoon of dark soy sauce.
now if you do n't have the dark it 's OK, you can use just all regular.
'cause now i 'm going to put in one tablespoon or regular soy sauce so if you do n't have the dark, just use, two tablespoons of that.
i have half a tablespoon of the chinese cooking wine.
i have a half a tablespoon of hoisin sauce.
now i 've started using his ku chung.
hoi sin sauce.
i , i really like it, it seems to be less chemically flavored than the others anyway.
i 've got one teaspoon of black vinegar.
one teaspoon of sugar.
one teaspoon of sesame E oil.
and then i want to give us a good stir and set it.
inside , yeah, this is a few ingredients in here but make everything ahead of time.
and then it all comes together do n't worry.
OK few ingredients to talk about.
i 've got dried red chili peppers here.
i 'm using three and these are pretty spicy.
you can use pretty much anything you want you could leave him out completely, but it should have a little bit of that.
i have about two teaspoons of chopped ginger, this are coarsely chopped for garnish.
i 've got some, uh, sliced up green onion and some sesame E seeds.
i 've got some flower for dipping.
i 'm using about a third of a cup exactly.
how much, is not really that important, but a third of the cup is a good starting point, you can.
maybe can get by with a quarter cup, you may need a half a cup, you do n't want to use too much.
because you 're dipping raw chicken in it.
so when you get done, you 're going to have to throw it away, so anyway.
and here i have one tablespoon of cornstarch.
one tablespoon of water.
and we 're going to use this to.
thicken , arsos later go ahead and mix it up that way.
it 's ready whenever we are.
almost , almost up to temperature, but i 'm not quite there, but we 're going to start doing.
we 're going to start taking some of these chicken pieces and give him.
a light dusting of this flower kind of set him to decide that will my oil gets the temperature, i 'll be ready.
i can start dropping him in alright will temperatures good, and what i was looking for is three hundred and fifty degrees.
F we 're going to start put in our chick in nice and slow, you do n't want to crowd the pan i 'm gonna work at some batches they were about two minutes in, i want, to put this a little bit more, color on here the caesar floated up coloring up really good gotta listen to the sounds of what your oils doing it starts getting carried away or smoking turn the temperature down, puts more chicken in there, if, there if it 's not making any sizzling noise and you 're not brown probably too cold.
is your brown stop making seriously noise, that means moisture is not no longer coming out when you 're over done?
go ahead and take these out that alright.
we 're getting the last little bit of our chicken out of the hot oil except this over here to the side now turn the burner down.
i do n't need it.
so hot, the.
next step, normal, do normal pour off most of this oil.
but then will pour it all off going to wipe this pan out, get rid of all the little chicken bits and such will be right back OK.
so i got my pan wiped out.
i did n't worry about getting all out just pretty good, now.
the chickens got some oil on it.
we 're going to put just a little bit this oil back in here, turn our heat back probably about to a medium.
we 're going to put our ginger an chili peppers in here season that oil up soften the ginger a little bit, oh, yeah, smells good smell, a ginger, and chili peppers.
they want i do n't want to burn the peppers.
this will help soften the peppers up.
it 'll put some heat into the oil.
get that, ginger flavor into the oil alright.
we 're getting just a little bit of color, are ginger that 's good going to stir sauce up one more time and then pour that in and we 're going to bring the sauce up to a boil alright that did n't take long sauces up to a boil.
now we 're going to store our cornstarch and water mixture, you have to do that 'cause the cornstarch will start to settle out when we 're going to pour this in.
then , give it a mix.
they cannot sauce.
i 'm a boy had turned his burner off.
well , we do n't need to put any more heat in.
here , here we go.
now we 're going to put our chicken in here, and we 're going to toss the chicken.
and we 're done.
i 'm going to plate this up and i 'll be right back.
OK , so will do will put some sesame E seed zone here with some green onion on here, OK, so how does it taste huh batteries.
nice and light is not hard.
the sauce is not sweet at all, so if you want it sweet add some more sugar.
