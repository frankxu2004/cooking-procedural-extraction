hey guys and laura tally, on this episode of laura in the kitchen i 'm going to show you how to make a very classic tuscan soup recipe, called the strong, here 's what you need spinach carrots.
salary potatoes, garlic onion, fresh basil pancetta tomato paste chicken broth, red kidney beans, diced tomatoes shortcut pasta, and of course, extra virgin olive oil salt pepper first thing you want to do is wash your spinach and just trim any big stems like that one i just trim it just.
because sometimes the ends can be a little bit too tough, OK.
now going to start chopping up vegetables in appeal both carrots it 's easier to just do this over a large bowl.
so you do n't have any feels going all over counter karen 's appealed.
now just kind of problem.
i find it easier to just cut them in half for my own safety and cut that in half i just do it.
nice dice at the in the middle next is the salary same thing you just want to cut it.
you want to be about the same size so it cooks evenly OK just like that.
this little dice in the bowl next is your onion, just a small onion define K spill.
the atar skin is kind of tough and dry.
oops , there you go like i said, you want all the best tools to be by the same size.
i just put two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a big soup pot, and i 've let it preheat for just a couple seconds.
and now i 'm going to add my fit pancetta.
what does saut√©ing at, krispy at once.
i 'm going to remove it from the pan.
i want to put in my chalk vegetable, meanwhile, what depend tennis crisping up.
i 'm going to peel and chop my potatoes now, depending on your size, you might need one, or two.
i 'm just going to come one and see how much that use mean, this is a pretty large potato, well, what have and he 's going to cut, and another half.
well , i think, i think one potato do pretty big, and just going to stick with one my pen settings.
my thin crispy understand, take it out.
i 'm gonna add in my vegetables.
OK , you wanna, let you cook.
and so the vegetable starts coughing last four to seven minutes now, while the vegetables cooked just going to type up my clover garlic whack it with the back of your knife.
just makes it easier to get to peel off.
there we go and just give it a little chunk.
this traffic in life back and forth.
OK , that 's good and that was the potatoes.
so we can add the potatoes on the garlic with our vegetables halfway through it 's been about three minutes since my vegetable start cooking.
and as you can see the onions are starting to get a little common lines at the bottom at this point.
i 'm going to add my potatoes in my garlic.
i 'm going to let them cook for another three to four minutes and you will notice that i did n't solve my vegetables.
i normally saw every element of, of the ingredients while i 'm making a recipe.
but this time i did n't, because i sauteed depend chatter in the oil.
so the pantiles very salty.
but there 's plenty of salt left in the oil to give it to the rest of vegetables at the cook for about three to four minutes when i get my stock in my tomatoes.
it 's been about seven minutes total that all the vegetables when cooking in the olive oil.
but now i 'm going to just add in my fourteen ounce can of red kidney beans die rinsed and drained.
hey going to add in a fourteen ounce.
can a top tomatoes young?
OK , i am going to add in three hands of chicken stock.
OK , now i 'm going to add in about.
i do n't know big teaspoon full of tomato piece.
because i really like my minestrone to be very timidly coming to add that lid on for about twenty minutes.
medium heat for about twenty minutes when it comes to a boil you want to add in your spinach and your pasta.
they 're all cook together and get really nice and thick and then at the end will season it so it 's been kind of about twenty minutes.
now sounds perfect.
it 's just where you wanted to me.
OK , i 'm going to season it, make sure you taste before you season with salt.
because like i said, the pen chat is very salty at this point.
i 'm going to add my pasta buttercup a shortcut pasta, thanks and i 'm going to add in a few leaves of basil OK and my pen shadow when the pasta is cooked just about a minute before it 's ready or at our spinach when i 'm at eight minutes and i put the past in it 's almost ready.
so now i 'm just going to toss in my spinach.
and this will take literally a minute to wilt down.
you just want to work it in your pan.
OK , give us about a minute or self.
once it 's all wilton.
you can see at the soup is nice and thick.
it 's not watery.
the vegetables are cooked.
i need to do is played it here.
