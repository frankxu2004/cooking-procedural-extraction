today , i 'm going to make my recipe for japanese misso soup.
the ingredients are going to need team, seems or wontons soy sauce.
ginger garlic water chestnuts, misso paste.
i use red bok, choy.
and here you go snow peas to chili 's depending on what you want it, you might not want any chili 's you might want to put more in.
he see mushrooms, bean sprouts and spring onions.
roar yama, let 's get started.
first , we want four cups of water.
two tablespoons of misso paste lovely misso paste.
OK , now we want to be this a really good stir.
so it does n't globe everywhere and a good way to do this is to get a measure and just mash it down.
so it breaks it up a bit that looks pretty good.
OK , now we 're going to put one level teaspoon of ginger paste places, i can get two heaped teaspoons of garlic there.
we go this is store, well, soy sauce, just like a dash or two.
so , like that, that 's about enough just keep mixing it all the while.
the heat should be on low to low medium.
and you put in the water chestnut to cut up basically close to a whole can two thirds to three quarters of a can of chestnuts.
next we put in the page about six snow peas, cut up next.
we 're pulling in all the spring onions like cut up.
now just cut up as much as you want personal taste i usually cut up roughly about fifty to one hundred grams, that should do it.
makes me throwing the bok, choy about hundred fifty two hundred grams.
once again, whatever your preference use and we just give it a stir.
now you throw in chili 's that of cut up pudding about to chili 's, i use green.
you can use red, or whatever color you want.
if you do n't like things spicy and do n't put chili 's in.
but i like to have a little bit of spice, get that all mixed in there.
next , we put in the bean sprouts just really mean like that about fifty grands roughly and still raining.
next we put in mushrooms that seventy five grams come up small, like that and give you some other store.
steering is very important when it comes to, well, most pretty is really keep a consistent, moving around.
yahoo , look at this now the final ingredient game sims or one tons, i used him sims pulling about between a dozen in eighteen.
that 's how much i put in given the string out, the amount of time it would take to get to this process of cleaning the final ingredient in is probably around thirty to forty five minutes, depending on what consistency.
you 're looking for in the soup in the liquid part.
so now these being put in the dim sims will leave that on about sim, a pretty low for five to ten minutes, and then it will be done.
