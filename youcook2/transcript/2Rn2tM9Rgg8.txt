now we 're off to thailand to visit with our good friend on hi.
he 's the head chef at the royal thai air force officers, club of bang cock.
he 's worked in some of the finest restaurants in thailand, japan and hong kong.
so what do we need to first get started today, today, we 're going to be allowed first of all, let me give you a few of the ingredients input type.
we start with fresh or dry rice noodles, chicken eggs, cool, fresh shrimp.
or , you can use dried shrimp roasted peanuts that have been crushed preserve turnips chopped up legato extra firm tofu.
have dice chopped garlic and chopped red onions followed by beansprout and garlic chives or green onions?
i got me people ground.
dried roasted chili peppers and one important ingredient that you ca n't do with that bob styles, and we 're going to make the sauce fish sauce coconut.
palm sugar, and tamarind sauce.
we 're going to make the sauce first.
we 're going to make the sauce.
i 'm going to show you what ingredients go into the sauce and let 's begin for the thoughts.
you do n't need too much.
you just kind of use medium heat change.
the special pan for this, or is it just any kind of camp you can use any kind of pan for this.
i 've been more time.
first , we 're going to add the camera and saw how much tamarind sauce career that amon sauce will be using about one cup after that.
we 're going to put in fish sauce about one cup of fish sauce and then we 're going to add the coconut palm sugar about two tablespoons of that.
this looks like it 's going to make enough food for four people.
actually , if you use the amounts, i 'm using in this recipe.
you 're going to be able to make enough for ten service.
big servings, what we 're going to do is make a lot more sauce than we need for today and then, we 're going to just keep.
but we do n't use in the refrigerator and we can use.
then we make what type of matter how long.
do you leave that boiling for going to stir it until the sugar starts the mills with a cool, and then i 'll let it simmer maybe about five minutes or.
so and then we 'll be ready to use, it should come out looking like this sauce right here?
so now we 're going to move on to the frying stage.
so the first thing you want to do is set your pan or your walk over the stove and turn the fire up to a kind of a medium high heat.
once the pan is hot, go ahead and add some oil.
how much oil you put in about three tablespoons of oil.
next we 'll add the chopped red onions and chopped garlic about one tablespoon of each will do a car horn down south dallas on a man.
next we 'll add the diced tofu.
let 's put it all in here.
that will make about four servings now how much of this tofu do you use about one piece about this.
the typical kind of tofu that you find at the store, is this a different kind?
actually , you can use any kind of tofu just make sure it 's the extra firm tofu.
next we 're going to have the chop turnips cause of chop turnips are you going to would say about four teaspoons, then you want to start stirring it to heap string just for a little bit until it starts to smell good thirty seconds, or so.
yeah , i 'd say about half.
now if you 're in thailand, and you 're going to add dried shrimp recipes.
so let 's go ahead and get some dried shrimp going to put about three tablespoons of dried trip that shirt too often at the store.
can you use some other kind of trends?
so sure if you do n't have dried shrimp you can always use fresh shrimp or frozen shrimp from the supermarket.
i can have it.
i think if it 's frozen and make sure to thought first coming out while i like to use, both if it 's a fresh shrimp and you need to take the head off just grab the shrimp like this, and just separate the head from the body types like to cook shrimp with the head out at the right size really like to cook shrimp with the head still on, OK.
now we 're going to kind of stir it for a little bit, just left the shrimp and cook, let me turn the fire.
now a little here.
if you 're going to make four servings like i 'm doing here, you probably want to have four big shrimp.
but if you 're going to use little simpson maybe ten were using fresh water shrimp here.
but if you do n't want to use fresh water fruit you can use any kind of shrimp on the smallest size that 's right.
any kind of shrimp when this is done, we 're going to add some of this over here.
fresh noodles now the amount of noodles fresh noodles that i 'm adding for this recipe yes about it 's a pound and the noodles are wet.
because you soak them before here in thailand.
we use the fresh noodles and that 's why they 're saw.
if you 're using the bride package noodles, you 're going to have to soak them in water.
so that they get a little softer before you, before you start private OK now.
i 'm going to add a little bit of water here to soften up the noodles even little more OK.
now we 're going to stir this up a little bit until the noodles get nice and soft.
you 'll probably find that the ingredients that we use here in thailand and the ones you 'll find in the west.
are n't exactly the same?
but that 's OK, this is how we do it in thailand.
are you cooking this for two three minutes, about half a minute?
if you use the fresh noodles now, if you use the dry noodles, you 're going to have to cook them longer, maybe two three minutes just cook him until they 're soft.
i 'm going to add a little more oil here, if you see the noodles to dry.
and then i 'm going to add some eggs for this recipe.
i might add about three eggs.
add the eggs right in there.
it 's important that you have a real hot wok when you stir fry poty to get the real flavor to come out OK.
now after you added the eggs in.
you 'll want to add the sauce that we made earlier get low mother fucked by now for this recipe.
i 'm going to use about six tablespoons of sauce and enough of all people.
four people announcer, now once we 've added, the sauce, we can add this.
the bean sprouts long it up mail still good.
and then i 'll add the chives.
so about a cup of garlic child that 's right about a cup of chives and a couple of bean sprouts.
now if you want it spicy, you 're going to want to add some of this dry roasted ground peppers in there.
i 'm going to make it not too spicy, so i 'm just going to add a little bit.
what , about the people who die spicy if you do n't like, spicy you do n't have to add it at all.
it will be fine so it depends on the individual test right now.
we 're not sure if your guests like it spicy or not spicy can also put the ground peppers on the side of the dish and they can add it in themselves.
OK , now it 's done, and this is going to be enough for about four or five good service will dish it out that room is my fairly new in thailand.
it 's the flower of the banana plant, then will add some bean sprouts will put them over here to the side next will add some thai herbs.
some green onions, and if you like that lemony flavor, you can squeeze some limes over it in america.
