it 's a beautiful chicken caesar salad.
it 's quite easy to make especially if you use a store bought dressy, but i really love a homemade dressing.
so i 'm going to show you how to do that you can make.
the homemade dressing with electric hand beaters, but i 'm going to do it very simply in a food processor.
so that 's all blitz, together.
it 's become this beautiful creamy, emulsion.
and i 'm just going to taste it, see if it needs any more sober people.
more , more lemon juice.
the next thing i need to do is just a slice, up some lovely chicken breast.
and i 'm going to lightly pan fry.
being very careful not to drive out.
then i need to cook some bacon, some croutons.
and perch, a few weeks.
i 've got two cutting boards out here.
one i 'm going to use for the chicken and the bacon and the other one.
i 'll use for the salad vegetables and also for the bread.
'cause you ca n't cross, contaminate you meet with your vegetables is very important.
i finished the croutons, and now i 'm going to purchase makes i can do it all in the same pan.
i 'll just wipe it out to make sure there 's no bread crumbs in their pouring some boiling water.
and i need to bring it to quite a gentle simmer to poach the eggs.
it 's really important to perch, takes that the water is on a really gentle simmer.
if it 's boiling too rapidly, they 'll just break up and fly apart and the other really important thing is that the eggs are as fresh as you can possibly get.
so they have it, it 's my warm chicken caesar, salad and let me tell you that played a food will make my family very happy.
