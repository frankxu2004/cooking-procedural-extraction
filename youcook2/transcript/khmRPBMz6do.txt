how do you think everyone thank you so much for tuning in to cook with april today?
we 're going to show you how to make spicy tuna rolls, justin took me to a like a sushi class right.
it was the sushi institute of LA and we learned how to make spicy tuna roll.
so , this recipe, the credit goes to the sushi institute of LA, so stay tune and learn how to make it.
i 'm not a pro like roller, but, you know, it 's all about the taste right so safe.
let 's get started.
we have to, have to use sashimi grade, tuna.
it 's very important because of the freshness in the flavor and you 're going to slice your sashimi grade.
tuna in through the smallest pieces you could possibly slice it into you can even use your hands.
because the tuna is really tender and then you 're going to place at tuna any large full next.
you 're going to slice some green onions.
then you 're going to add some mayonnaise.
i have the complete ingredient lists an measurements in the information box.
if you 're interested, so, i 'm gonna make the tuna and mayonnaise together with a spatula, then i 'm gonna add some chili powder mixture, then i 'm adding some chili oil.
because it is spicy tuna.
so it 's gotta.
be spicy, then, i added some free rotcha for another kick of spiciness, and i 'm mixing all those ingredients together with a spatula, then i 'm adding some of those green onions and i 'm mixing again with my spatula, and you 're going to cover that with a surround rap and let that marinate or sit in the refrigerator overnight.
or for at least an hour next you are going to work on your rice, you must use short grain rice or any rights.
that 's labeled sushi rice and remember to wash and rinse your rice about four times and click your ice on the white rice, setting now, you 're going to work on the flavoring for the rice.
you 're going to add some rice vinegar.
then you 're also going to add some sugar, and you 're going to mix the rice vinegar and sugar together until it completely dissolves.
then you 're going to add some salt again.
you 're going to make those ingredients until it dissolves once the rice is cooked in not too hot.
add the rice flavoring which is the rice vinegar sugar and salt and you 're going to mix those together.
now you 're ready to work on your sushi.
grab your nori in place of shiny side on to the map where the bumpy side is facing you.
then you 're going to add your rice and use your fingers to press the rice theorem.
an add more ice, if it does n't cover up the nori sheet and then you 're going to add some sesame E seeds to sprinkle it lightly or add more, if you like you 're going to flip it over and make sure you cover your sushi mat with a saran wrap.
because it will keep your mat clean.
so you 're going to place the spicy tuna mixture inside, and then you 're going to roll with your hands in a tip that i have.
for you is if your hands get too sticky like mine rinse your hands with some water and it wo n't be a sticky.
so you 're just going to roll it, make a caterpillar shape.
if you want i call it a caterpillar shape.
so i 'm just going to press down.
and i 'm using them at to make it a perfect.
shape , and it 's ready to be cut, you 're going to just cut your sushi into about eight pieces or.
so and if it 's too hard to cut.
i like, i like rinsing my knife with water.
that 's what i learned at the institute so your sushi is ready.
you have with sabi and ginger and you are ready to enjoy this sushi is set up.
it 's on a nice plate there, the gingers, there was sabi soy sauce and the chopsticks.
this mean, i get to try it.
and , as you can see, i have like a lot more ginger and justin has a little bit.
i could just like eat ginger through the eyes are close.
well , that is delicious.
it 's, yeah, it 's so good.
yeah , you did a great job, you 're traditionally you 're supposed to eat sushi one by try to roll.
i saw like blue a lot of writes.
and i love this spice that you made it actually a little spicier than most like spicy tuna rolls.
i 've had which i like, oh, yeah, i did the chili powder and then i did the chili oil.
and then i was like, you know, what hubby loves three rochat, oh, man that is so good, thank you, honey.
i 'm going to try it later because i look funny when i need sushi, 'cause like it does n't fit in my mouth.
so i like balls look great, so, thank you.
