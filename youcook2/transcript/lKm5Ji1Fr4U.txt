hello , welcome back to another session with your work shift at whatever dot com what comes to your mind when i say, soup first thing you think of is a cold, a warm comforting steaming hot tartar, see how easy it is to land on tomato soup, that is, be cause i together, with one billion other indians will testify to the fact amount of soup falls under the category of comfort foods.
it is definitely.
indian , indian national soup is supposed to be more of an issue, that is, or is it.
if you travel in the famous indian railways, and want soup, you get tomato.
if you walk into any hotel and see soup section on the menu, you may not actually find motor than a butt.
i 'm willing to bet hundred bucks that you will see its amount of sir to make this camera slope.
just heat some butter in a pan had little bit timmins.
it 's because i love to adeline, come in just add lembit, kimisis, back then.
chop garlic, ten.
add some chobani and very little for three tomatoes.
i 've used half a small audience, you can add any vegetables you want to this.
so i love to use the celery in my soup.
because celery gives a very nice flavor.
you can add leaks you can add carriage, you can add any vegetables you want and one more vegetable.
i love in tomato soup is bell pepper.
there is a green pepper or we call it capsicum in india.
so use little bit, so what this does, is it gives a very nice over to your camera soon after you started this for a moment at choctaw?
models add a little salt.
the one hope that goes excellent with your tomato soup is based on.
if you have this will just add, you know, i do n't have basil.
so , or, you know, what actually, i think i have OK , OK.
i have this metal.
how i just bought it recently, so it is hanging out there, so we 're going to use some of these basil.
if you add best immediately very nice, flavor comes, i do n't know how.
but somehow i 'll find my ingredient.
so i 'm somewhere other.
so add some pepper.
so after you have cooked this tomato puri, what you do is transfer it into a blender for a soup, you need some kind of thickening.
so what we 're going to do we 're going to make some group.
we 're going to make some blonde group.
blonde rule is slightly golden in color, so what i 'm going to do i 'm at.
i 'm going to add some mira around one teaspoon.
maybe a little less than one piece phone of mine are what i did.
i added one tablespoon of all purpose flour to my butter and on a slow flame i 'm going to cook along with the butter, the rule is slightly brown.
see i 've taken this tomato.
what i made i strained it.
and i 'm going to add little by little first add very little and then add slowly, see, if you add everything at one time.
this is going to form lumps once it gets slightly dissolve, then add the entire amount , god.
there is no simple this for like ten minutes.
then we will check salt and seasoning, oh, yeah, you know, while, while blending, i added very little red color.
because to get this nice, to metal kind of consistency and i allowed to add little bit of sugar in my tomato , serve.
that gives a very nice test to the soup.
cream is optional, but i love to add, so i 'm going to add a little bit of cream to my tomato soup, look at this.
the whole studio is smelling nice tomato soup with nice basin from my hub section by the way, many toppings can also be used such as sour cream, shredded cheese crackers or salsa.
but with kids around the world believe me.
i do n't know what the fascination is with little kids.
maybe all the kids like to see the brown floating things and if you ever wonder what those brown floating things on the top of tomato soup, do n't fear you can even make that at home, if you stick with my show, maybe you will even learn how the manufacturer husband at home that learns to cook coming back to those little brown things, they 're called croutons there, nothing.
but need squares of bread that are deep fried and they turn crispy golden brown, when the float and slowly.
so can the tomato soup, they make you a hero in front of your kids when i started the show, i did n't realize that i did n't have protons.
but i had bread.
so what i did.
i simply fright my breads, and now i have them on my tomato soup.
those little brown things floating.
