hi , everybody, welcome to the mom sue.
i love cooking videos.
i 'm excited because colts cooking in my house.
i do n't really get used to this, like you can come over anytime.
we really should have dinner.
but today we 're having a vegetarian dish.
so i 've made these sweet potato black bean burritos before on the shade cards, but i 've never actually showing the recipes.
so where you get to see how they are made, and you can choose to make them yourself these are actually vegan.
but you can, we sometimes put cheese in them and make them non vegan vegetarian still vegetarian.
but you can also put me in them if you want to, because they would be good with me as well.
so there 's so good.
an like hardy that you do n't miss the meat in them because of the beans in the sweet potatoes and there 's just so much goodness in there.
i think the hard thing sometimes was going vegetarian is just the texture of meat not getting that texture, but there 's it was definitely substantial.
and my family loves it.
so let 's start OK.
so what are we going to need for this recipe.
OK , we 're going to start with sweet potatoes, and you can either do like three large ones or fortified small ones.
and i just had one that was until just in case.
you do n't notice we potato looks like and sometimes you do n't so, you know, i 'm always confused, too.
so do you always use like the yams, the orange ones or do you ever use like the, the white sweet potatoes.
i usually use the orange ones.
but i think you can use whatever condiment really it does n't matter, but these are the ones that i always use in this recipe because they look prettier.
thank you look so pretty now you 're going to need black beans, you can either so calm yourself or get canned ones 'cause that 's what i do.
i used about three cans of black beans and that will be enough to make a big pot for our whole family, like a big tray for a whole family guests over you might want more than that.
so three cans of black beans one large onion for about four cloves of garlic for more salt and pepper to taste brown sugar if you want to add sugar, you do n't have to put the brown sugar, and of course, i just like the taste of it, obviously, i 'm addicted soy sauce, one tablespoon anna tablespoon of worcester shire sauce.
if you do n't have one, or the other, you can always substitute two tablespoons of whichever one.
you have a tablespoon of olive oil three tablespoons of chili powder two tablespoons of cumin this little bit, less i did n't have, anymore coon in my can.
i collect dang.
it i should 've last year was like thinking.
i forgot to ask you, but that 's OK and then a tablespoon of mustard in a tablespoon of ketchup.
i love adding suite two recipes like this.
because there are.
so many spicy things in savory things that it 's good to like bring out more of the sweet potato.
so that 's way is always great to act recipes like this.
i think and that 's why i added it into this recipe 'cause i 'm a sweet person.
some people are more like salty spicy, but i left, i love it.
all give it all to me.
this is everything that you would ever want.
yes , and i did leave out the hot sauce.
but you can add any kind of process that you like to this.
but when i make it for my kids, i usually leave that part out.
OK , so what are we going to do first going to cut up our potatoes and start them boiling.
and then we 'll put all the stuff in the beans and start that.
so kind of property to.
so how long does it usually take to boil the sweet potatoes the potatoes only take about ten minutes to soften and then mash them and then i put him to the side.
but the beams will take about twenty minutes.
so you know, anytime in between there if you want to start the beans first and then do the potatoes.
i would like to start him first for some reason.
OK , so i 'm really happy that i have a partner in crime today.
because normally i do all this by myself, or i have one of the kids help.
so it was really scary alright so she 's going to cut up the potatoes and get those started.
while i show you guys, how to mix all the beans normally.
i do this on the stove top.
but where we just want to show you right here 'cause it 's easier.
so i 'll start with the olive oil, and i 'll put that in the pound first.
and that does not take very long to heat up.
and you do n't want to let olive oil sit on the stove top, getting hot 'cause it gets too hot.
and it burns and it pops out you, and it 's messy, so, do n't let that get too hot before you put your.
so you 're going to put your onions on normally, you let them saute for a little bit.
maybe about two minutes and, and just.
so you know, it 's OK to out everything at once and then started like it does n't matter how you do it.
this is just the order that i usually do it in.
so you can just, however, works, for you, you do it that way, then going to put the beans in and at this point, the pan is going to be a little bit dry.
so then you 're going to put half of the water in, i guess i did n't show that part of the union have a cup and a half of water.
so you 're going to put maybe half the water in, and you 're going to let that cook together for a little bit.
and while the beans are cooking, you want to make sure that you 're mashing while you 're cooking them and then you can just add all your stuff.
so the sugar, and like all of this stuff it does n't matter at all, when you put it in how much you put in, if, you like, try it, and you decide, you know, it, babe i 'll put more soy sauce are less chili powder.
like you can decide i 'm all about that with recipes like i always get recipes on line and then i just change them up.
so much like i 'm like, you know, what that 's not working for me so feel free to do it.
however , you want and i sometimes put the garlic in with the onions.
but sometimes they take me so long to chop up that i end up just putting them in at the end.
and then salt and pepper to tease, however, much you want.
OK , then you 're going to mix that up.
mash it up.
let it simmer for about ten minutes.
mash it up some more let it simmer.
watch them make sure they do n't get too dry add water in masham until they 're kind of a nice smooth like refried bring texture, and i do n't match them up until they 're totally smooth.
there 's always going to be some chunks of beans in there.
and that 's totally fine.
so we 're going to let that cook for minute and this boil, these boiling will be right back and will probably eat some chocolate in between 'cause that 's fun.
so we 've cooked the potatoes, and we 've mashed them.
i did n't add anything to the potatoes.
we just cut him up, put him in the pot and boil.
for about ten, fifteen minutes, and then mash them up spraying the water first.
it 's a little thing you got little things that like i do n't cook.
so someone does n't say that, then i would be like this is with the water.
maybe not, but just in case, you never know.
so you got your potatoes, and then, the beans i ended up having to add a little bit more water wall i was cooking them.
so just keep that in mind, depending on this weird.
i did n't know about cooking.
but depending on your elevation, you need to add more water 'cause it 's we 're in a dry climate, and we 're up higher.
the , so it sucks.
the , the water out quicker, so i had to add more water, but i notice in california.
when i put it in a cup and a half, it was too much, so, depending on where you live, just kind of watch the water alright.
so we have the beans are all mashed up and cooked potatoes.
and we 're just going to put him together.
i usually put sweet potato on the bottom and just depending on how much you want to put on there.
i just put like a little doll up to get them, then a double up on top of those depends on how big your tortillas are.
how big you want the burritos something, but kind of just an even amount of both develop there.
we go is beautiful and then i always fold the ends in first and then wrap one side and tuck it and then roll it that way when you 're eating you do n't have stuff falling up the ends.
so and then, we 're just putting them in a baking dish, if you do n't want to keep 'em vegetarian or vegan you can put cheese on him at this point and i usually put cheese on the inside and then i put cheese on the outside as well, 'cause jesus fun and then this is the this is where you would add me too.
if you want to add any get up, me you 'll want to already cooked though for sure likes to cook your meat and then add it into the burrito.
now you put them in the oven, for about twelve to fifteen minutes just to make the tortillas a little bit crispy alright there.
all finished an we just left him in for about twelve fifteen minutes.
so that all crispy, an awesome.
now , so good, they do smoke it right.
so you want to make sure their cool before you get him out of the pan, and if i 'm serving him to my kids always cut him in half like that, 'cause i have some cool off faster but, yeah, and then you can put sour cream or avocado 's or guacamole or like anything.
it 's also like you can add anything to it yummy.
so you 're ready to try it.
OK , it 's already so good.
so , yeah, i think it 's good look at some cheese to an extent.
yeah , there really good, without cheese too, so such a yummy healthy dish.
