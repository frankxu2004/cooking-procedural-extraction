everyone in our family lowes, pirogue, especially when my mother who was always known as big martha in the family made them.
and i work closely by your side, writing down a recipe.
so we would have them forever.
it works beautifully.
it is softap.
it is tender.
she rolled it out.
thinly she did n't make the peroni too big.
she only had one kind of cutter, so we 're going to start with one large egg.
you can just whisk so right and then into the one large two tablespoons.
sour cream, so it 's not a lot.
it 's just that i 'm a little bit.
but it makes a difference.
there are some very nice brookie places, will go there some night with your new boyfriend?
can i mention, oh, god, i always glad one cup of water?
one cup of whole milk, and i 'm just going to keep whisking, yeah, and i too much air.
we just want it mixed, well, but not, a lot of bubbles and then flower cup by cup, use it now use it with this phone.
all , right, course, first, and this makes a wet sticky dough that, that has to be needed for quite awhile.
the next cup can go in and did i mention it 's five cups of all purpose flour and then see how nice the dough is.
one of us has to do the needing.
so why do n't you do that.
put your put a lot of flower on your hands and use a bunch scraper like grandma did.
she lifts with a bench scraper and pushes with the heel of the left hand, left hand only one hand.
you have to save one hand for the telephone and so now will take this and start to roll it out.
so here i 'll give you an eighth.
put some flower down here not on the crack here, and you want to get it to be somewhere less than an eighth of an inch thick, do n't press hard?
and this is a rolling pin, so it 's not a prissy, got it.
and this is a ball bearing thin.
that 's why i gave you a ball bearing because it 's not oppressing its rolling.
see how nicely it rolls when you do n't press too hard addressing anymore.
now do n't waste any doubt is close to the edge as possible, and they cut perfect rounds and do a little twist, twist really hard.
can i see how nicely you cut it?
we always had so much fun doing this next step, making the i call it the sweet cabbage filling, which is my favorite.
an you take real cabbage.
my mom would go to the store and ask for the old cabbages that are dried out.
kind of desiccated and then she would seem them in which is like this, and just in on iraq in a big pot and then the hard work started.
this is hard on a board wedged into the sink like this, you would wrap the joke, so now you squeeze here.
just squeeze get every speck of water out of it, and that 's, why he 's a strong muslin cloth or cheesecloth see.
now you 'll see how much water comes out of that, and then you push it on the board to this, it uses elbow grease.
so give me a piece of cabbage is.
so i can, if it 's too wet, unfortunately it just does n't work that well.
so here, here is this little, little piece of this shriveled up seed cabbage, their meat chopper actually chops it up.
so chopper cabbage at you.
it comes out in nice little pieces.
now whoever devised this i will never know.
now this is a half a stick of butter and then look at this eight ounces cream cheese have to be in there.
and you think that, that 's rich, but she 's have small.
these dumplings are just, just so small.
yes , and you can eat twenty of them with no difficulty pepper.
oh , yeah, that 's terribles of admit lots of black pepper very important to have the black pepper, but see how this is not wet OK.
it 's very important that this feeling not be wet and salt lots of salt.
that 's a cheese and seasoning is important, because there 's nothing here except doen cabbage.
so , so, now we have water boiling all the stuff.
you 're going to make these right away here.
and i use mine.
and we 're going to use flower on your fingers, just to make sure that they 're not going to stick to the dough, and i had these covered with cloth.
it 's very important not to let the dough dry out.
just get all the flower off stretch the dough a little bit, not too much but just a little.
yeah , and see this little spoon, you do n't want too much filling, but you do n't want too little so a small teaspoon like this is good.
then you just did you tell grandma was doing it in the picture, so fast.
i 've never mastered, that is, exactly is hers, but, but you pull these edges exactly together.
let me see, oh, you 're fast, yeah, are these going on a cloth with a little bit of no?
we have some already made the girls were practicing before we went on, yeah, yeah, but, you know, why do they work salted water?
make sure it 's salted, and we 're just going to drop these in, and they 're done.
i 'm put in years in perfect, and i 'm praying mine in and sophie, and you wait and stir.
but if you stir these do n't stir with something like this stir, with the back of a wooden spoon.
the handle just to keep them, you do n't want to break them at all.
these are all little tricks that grandma taught.
look , floating you 're beautiful.
they float for about a minute and then you take them out.
yes , let them cook because you do not want the dough to be undercooked.
so these are done.
now , do n't just put the pro geason a bear plate always, according to grandma, put a little melted butter on the plate and let it go all over the plate.
and then you put the hot gorgeous pierogies, well, drain play we 're going to go into the kitchen and eat all of these during intermission.
a little bit of melted butter there, too, many people fail goes up in here.
