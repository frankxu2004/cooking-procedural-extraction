hey guys his buddha.
um , as legacy, i 'm cooking i 'm making some chuckles, tonight.
i 'll remember i had did the cooking with buddha lock series.
well , i had made a mistake and deleted that playlist awhile ago.
so i 'm basically going to start it over again.
so i 'm going to start over with this video here, which is what.
i did the first time.
i started the series i had made an tacos so.
now , i 'm doing it again.
an i 'm making it with ground beef, you can make it with ground turkey as well, or brown chick in i do n't particularly care for ground chick in basically.
but i put in a meet up, put up lori season assault.
some onion powder very little garlic powder, and some black ground pepper as you could see the meat is done is well done.
is all brown, so, let 's say, i 'm about to turn it off?
K let that cool off i 'm going to have to drain that, that liquid.
OK , so what i 'm going to use for the taco kit, i used this one all the time.
these ortega soft taco kit.
and it comes with the seasoning mix and the taco sauce.
so i have to get that season in mix outta here.
a totally forgot about that, a sister.
taco seasoning mix.
and i 'm going to just sift it gently on to the tacos, i mean, to the.
so the meat, well, it 's going to be tacos anyway.
i 'm right put the whole thing.
the whole thing spill it all out, spill it all out.
so once all that is one there you basically just mix it all up into the meat, make sure order meat has this taco seasoning on it.
make sure evenly distributed all around.
so this is cooking with buddha lock, series number one guys.
yup , is backing up again steely apologize and i 'm surprised i 'm so sorry?
i did n't even mention it to you guys along time ago.
but it just slipped my mind seriously and make sure you do it in a pan that does n't slide like this one.
we had this pan for so many years, but make sure you remix your meat, you know, make sure its study alright.
so that 's completely saturated all over when i come back.
i 'm going to come back with the finished product, so stay tuned sorry guys.
i 'm back with the finished product as you can see.
look at the presentation on an, oh, looks messy.
but that 's the point.
so what i did.
i took some cheddar cheese which is this one here.
i use the borden dairy natural finely, shredded four cheese mexican.
so has four different cheeses, has blend of cheddar moderate jack asadero in kissel, blanco cheese is.
so that 's how it looks up close in i put that on the bottom, first melted it in the microwave for twenty seconds, took it out.
then i put the meat, the lettuce tomato.
the salt cream i 'm going to put more sour cream 'cause i love a lot of soul train and this is the sour cream.
i use here, this is the friendship or natural sour cream.
so i 'm trying to use all natural stuff.
and now i 'm about to put the dick in smooth taco sauce.
why do n't talk?
and that 's good enough.
so this is the finished product guys.
this is mine by the way already gave my dad.
