hey chef jason hill, here an one day.
i came home and i found my daughter cooking up some pancakes.
it is super good super easy, and you 'll never want to buy one of those box pancake mixes again.
let me show you OK.
i 've put together my knees on clause things in place here.
and it came together really quick started with two level cups of all purpose flour, you need about one and a half to two cups of milk whole milk.
i 've got two tablespoons of butter that i 'm going meltdown in the microwave.
add a half teaspoon of kosher salt couple of large eggs, and this is two teaspoons of baking powder and a tablespoon of sugar, which is optional.
and then i 'm going to add a drop or two of vanilla OK first thing.
we 're going to do is combine all of the dry ingredients.
next we 're going to beat two eggs into the milk, OK.
now i 'm going to whisk in the melted butter and after i pull it out of the microwave.
i let it sit for a little bit.
i do n't want to put it in their piping.
hot , we 're going to gently mix in the milk and egg to moisten the flower and do n't worry if you have a few lumps in here well.
it 's about the consistency.
i like and then finally my little touch i like to do is just add a drop or two of vanilla extract.
OK , i 'm going to put my burners on about medium high, and i like this little flat top griddle that i have that you can use a regular pan, i 'm going to get that nice and preheat it OK good way to test to see for griddle is hot enough, you just take your hand.
he pushed him on there for a good.
i do n't know ten seconds or so, and if you remove your hand, he got a nice red tint to it, it 's ready just kidding do a couple of water drops and as soon as those bubble off like that.
your pan is hot how to season my griddle.
i 'd like to use a little butter.
you can use pan spray or oil.
if you like i 've got a high temp.
so wo n't melt onto the griddle really.
got about a third cup batter for each pancake spread a little bit of that around at this point.
do you can add different things to your pancake?
batter the ones in fresh blueberries, chocolate chips can tell your pancakes are starting to cook by looking at these little bubbles on the edges.
so this is going to be the first one.
i 'm going to turn come over here.
OK , i 'm going to keep it simple today just do a little bit of butter on each one drizzling fresh real maple syrup.
i guess it 's not fresh, but it 's real expensive.
stuff here, but it 's the best.
well , i just like to take my daughter for finding this easy recipe.
it 's really, really good and as always, thanks for tubing in so good you ca n't even compare this to the stuff you buy in the box.
