hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with waldorf salad that 's right.
i 'm gonna show.
so that should tell you something.
so let me go ahead and show you my version for this, and first we 're going to prep the celery.
but we 're not going to use regular stock celery use celery root, which looks like this, and we 're going to do to prep this.
we 're going to cut the top off and yes absolutely.
i 'm going to save that and use it for regular stock celery, and i 'm also trim off the bottom.
although i cut off way too much and then if you want you can peel this with the regular vegetable peeler.
but that surface has kind of narrowly, so i 'd like to just go wrong with a knife like this kind of shaving off that skin.
and we 're going to go all the way around, as well as trim up the bottom until basically we just have that white route.
and once that 's been trimmed out what we 'll do is we 'll cut like quarter inch slices.
and then we 'll take those slices and cut him into about quarter inch sticks, and, you know, what.
let 's go ahead and live dangerously and do two at once thereby doubling our production speed and once we cut those in the sticks.
as you well know all we need to do is turn them and cut them into nice fairly even cubes, so we will cube up our celery roots.
and once that 's done, what will do is, will toss it in some cold water and just let it sit there while we 're prepping our other ingredients, and this is not.
so much to prevent discoloration.
but i want those cues be fully hydrated.
and also i think that water might leach away just a little bit of the bitterness, but i ca n't prove it, but anyway regardless.
i 'm leave mine in some cold water and move on to the next thing you want to prep ahead of time.
your walnuts, so we 're going to host a handful of walnut pieces in a dry pan over medium heat 's just throw minent, awesome around until basically they smell like toasted walnuts, and it 's really not that easy to see on camera here.
but they are going to turn a little bit golden, and you might see a few broad marks here and there.
but we do n't want to go too far.
they get dark brown going to be too bitter.
so like i said, the best indication is just has those around in the dry pan until they sort of smell like toasted walnuts.
at which point will transfer those onto a plate to cool because of course.
the last thing you want on your cell it is hot nuts.
those aside let him cool off while we move on to the next thing on the prep list.
the dressing, which is ridiculously simple.
swimmable , we 're going to start with three parts mayonnaise to which we 're going to add one part sour cream or creme fresh, and i think it 's pretty obvious, which one.
i 'm using and then do that we 're going to add a little bit of sugar just a couple of inches as well as a pinch of salt.
a little touch of freshly ground black pepper and then of course.
so everything taste better a little touch of cayenne and the finish is often added juice of half a lemon, of course freshly squeezed, what kind of crazy person with access to fresh lemons is using the stuff in the bottle and then last.
but not least a little bit of freshly chopped eragon by all time favorite seafood herb is also my favorite all time fruit salad herb and i, will go ahead mix that together and are super simple.
but insanely delicious waldorf salad dressings , done.
so we give that a little whisking and then of course, taste for seasoning and because this is going to get tossed with other ingredients.
it is hard to know for sure, which you are going to want to taste it anyway, i mean, it 's sitting right there, and once our salad dressing this set, we 're ready to move to final assembly.
so the main ingredient in this salad is fresh apples.
and , this is how i suggest you prep them.
so we 're going to take our apple and cut it right down the middle.
and then we 'll cut each of those halves in half to make quarters, and then this is how i like to remove the core.
will just turn that piece like.
this , and then using your knife in about a forty five degree angle will just make one little cut right there in that core or at least.
twenty , five percent of it is going to be gone.
so very quick and easy technique to remove those seeds and then once we have our apple quartered and cored we will simply slice those wedges, lengthwise and cut him into whatever size chunks.
we want, so, that is the official food wishes technique, so go ahead and toss are apples in a bowl to which we can add.
are very well drained celery root cubes?
i 'm also going to do some green grapes, which i 've quartered, seedless green grapes, please do not use the ones with seeds instead of making a waldorf salad.
you 'll make an annoying salad and will also tussen are now cooled.
toasted walnut pieces and that 's it.
do not screw this sell it up by trying to be creative and throw bunch extra stuff in some people, put in dried fruit things like that.
but i 'm not into it, the only other thing we 're going to put in here, is our dressing, and we do in our fruit coded?
but we do n't want to totally swimming in the dressing.
so what i 'll do is i 'll throw some in and mix it up and then evaluate.
so that 's what i 'm doing right now.
i 'm staring at it thinking to myself, chef john.
you need a little more dressing, that 's what i call myself in my head.
so i tossed in another spoon and gave it a mix, and once that 's mixed up, and we feel like we have the perfect amount of dressing all we need to do is, give it a taste make sure everything is just right.
and then we have options.
we can serve this immediately, which i actually enjoy.
or you can wrap that up and put it in the fridge for up to twenty four hours.
this actually holds surprisingly, well, and then as far as how to serve it, you have so many options.
as you saw it made a beautiful base for some pan roasted chicken breasts.
but this is also a terrific side dish for things like roast turkey or pork chops very nice with this.
but heavy set all that i think my favorite way to enjoy this, is just in a bowl?
simple standalone fruit salad.
so that 's how i 'll be finishing this video off just serving that up as is with maybe a couple slice grapes for a little color contrast and of course a few extra toasted walnuts are going to hurt anything and that 's, it are waldorf salad is done.
so let me go ahead and dig in.
and like i said i just love the combination of tasting.
textures , here sweet, crunchy, tangy.
just really, really fantastic, and while i do enjoy waldorf salad, just using regular celery stocks i think by using the route, we get a little more interesting, a little more mild flavor enough of that bitter celery flavor to bring out the sweetness in the other fruit, which really is what makes a salad.
so delicious, but anyway, that 's it might take on the venerable waldorf salad, which as you may have guessed by the name was invented at the waldorf, astoria hotel in new york back in the day.
so , while this is a very old salad, it is still very relevant and by relevant, i mean, incredibly delicious and easy to make.
so i really do hope you give this a try soon.
head over to food wishes, dot com for all the green amounts and more info as usual, and is always enjoy.
