this piece could easily become their favorite final track of a disco evening just before now, every donnie.
i am coming at you today.
because i am going to try something new OK.
so every now and again i 'm going to venture off kind of away from the halls away from the makeup away from what here your other facets to life and one of those passes and i love to eat OK.
so i am going to be done a little short takes on a different meals that i might prepare and i 'm, i 'm really not going to do a whole lot of those, i mean, 'cause sometimes you get the pretty basic recipes, you know, that you do.
but i just thought that hey listen if i 'm sharing a little bit of my life with you as far as makeup is concerned where i 'm shopping at what i 've gotten when i went off to the store how i do my hair what products i use in my hair then see i can add a few snippets of my regular life where i actually have to cook meals.
because i do have to eat, and i do have my key is that like to eat as well.
so hey listen, i 'm getting ready to prepare a meatloaf an i 'm just that do n't have a name for it, it 's just a meatloaf, and i think it 's a rather simple recipe and i 'm going to invite you to join me and just see how i do what i do and you can do it also , alright.
please stay tuned OK.
check me out thanks guys.
music wonderful jazz fish go in fact, cancel wild, in one day.
