hi , i 'm randy radney from the conscious plate, comma.
i 'm a coach, a chef, and an expert in teaching people how to have the freedom to eat real food without worrying about getting fat and today.
i 'm going to show you how to make a healthy calamari.
so i 'm working here with the bodies of the column, mari today.
and i just want to show you what it looks like in advance.
i 've cut it into rings, which is probably what is more familiar to you if you are used to ordering like fried call amari in a restaurant.
you typically see it like this.
so i 've gotten my squid pre cleaned by my fishmonger ann, i recommend that you do that as well, and then you just want to take a good sharp knife and you want to slice through the tubes.
i 'm making a quick saute of calamari with extra virgin olive, oil and garlic and the thing that 's.
so interesting about calamari is that you can do one of two cooking methods with it, you can either cook it for a very long time and almost do it in order for it to be tender.
or you can cook it really quickly for just a couple of minutes, and it 'll still be tender anywhere in between.
you 're going to get this chewy, rubbery thing that you 're not going to want to eat and today.
we 're doing a quick cook.
have my pan on medium heat and two that i 'm adding some extra virgin?
now i 'm just letting the olive oil heat up and while it heat, i 'm adding to it.
some cloves of fresh garlic that i 'm actually pressing into the oil and the reason why i 'm pressing it is.
because i find that i get the most flavor.
it releases the oils in the garlic, if you do n't have a garlic press.
it 's a great tool.
i recommend having one.
i love it.
i 'm letting this garlic get golden brown.
if you like a little heat in your food, you could also add some crushed red pepper right now.
and you do n't want to take it much further because when garlic starts to burn.
it gets better.
and i 'm just going to give this the nice pinch of some unrefined sea salt.
and then i 'm going to give it a star to make sure that all the column mari is touching the surface of the pants and that everything can evenly hook.
and this is literally just going to go for about two minutes, and we 're going to watch as it just begins to turn opaque.
when it turns OK, believe it, or not.
that 's how fast.
that 's how it 's tender delicious and you 're going to want to eat it.
you take it any further and it 's going to be chilly in rubbery.
so here you have it a very, very simple dish.
sauteed , calamari, with garlic and extra virgin olive, oils i 'm randy rabney of the conscious plate dot com, and this is how you make a healthy calamari, yum.
