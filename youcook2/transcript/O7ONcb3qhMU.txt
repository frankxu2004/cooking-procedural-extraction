hi guys, and learn italian on this episode of lowering the kitchen.
i 'm so excited to bring you my recipe for onion rings.
now everyone loves onion rings, and it 's been requested almost on every single video, especially all my mozzarella sticks video.
everybody was like great.
let me now on your rings and rings, onion, rings, onion rings that everyone loves them.
there 's so many different ways of making them and i myself made them a few different ways and do like a breadcrumb coding beer battered or this is more like a classic , battered.
it 's what i 'm showing you today.
it 's so easy.
simple to put together the ingredients for them, or very few you 'll just need some all purpose flour hot sauce of your choice buttermilk.
you 'll need some granular onion.
garlic dried parsley, paprika baking powder celery salt and egg, a bit more salt, and pepper your onion and some vegetable oil and the ovens preheated for a different recipe.
so you 're going to stick around to see what that is.
now in here.
i 've got some peanut oil and you can use peanut.
or you can use vegetable oil.
i 've colored oil that can come up to high temperature without smoking a lot.
so you would want to use olive oil for this because it was smoking up the house and it turns brown and bitter very quickly.
so any light colored oil will do i 'm using peanut oil today because in a little bit, i plan on making some fried chikin.
and i have to have my fried chicken fried in peanut oil to sign the onion is a big, delicious, sweet, yellow onion.
and what i 'm going to do to this is i 'm just going to take off the very first layer cut the bottom and cut the top take off.
the very first layer maybe even two depending if you really need, to like, i 'm going to take off this layer as well it 's got a lot of brown on it, it 's pretty thin, it 's just going to cut this into big pieces of that, and.
now you can, you know up to you.
if you want them really thick, bacon cut them really think if you want some really thin, you can cut them thinner.
does n't really matter it.
really , sometimes just depends on my mood.
sometimes i get really fake.
sometimes , like, within just going to separate them, and it 's going to put this on my plate, so let me so good.
i 'm so excited, you know, a lot of people ask, oh, can you show us some healthier recipes healthy recipes?
but i think what most people, forget is that to upload, a new recipe, every other day you gotta do a little bit of everything and i want to please my audience and everyone asks for fried chicken and onion rings and french fries, and i want to show those recipes to you and share them with you.
but i 'm certainly not advertising that you eat them everyday.
in fact, it 's been a very long time since i 've made homemade onion rings.
because fried food around here is, we definitely do n't order when we 're out in order.
fried food on a regular basis, and i prefer to make things at home as you all know.
so from feeling up to it and make some fried chicken nothing wrong with that moderation lots of exercise or plunders alright.
this is fine.
i 'm going to save these to make a sauce, otherwise.
be little bit much.
or is it going are batter got my all purpose flour here.
and i 've got some butter milk and buttermilk is the key for a really delicious light and fluffy batter.
and , including also the baking powder is really important as well, and as far as spices, the world is your pickle.
i mean, if you like certain spices, add those, i mean, i love that combination so that 's what i use a good pinch of salt is really important.
and after freshly cracked black, black pepper, you could use white pepper here as well in a little bit of hot sauce.
i love saracho.
so that 's what i 'm using you could use tabasco.
you can use any kind of hot sauce.
you want it, so now i 'm just going to make this up until it 's pretty lump, free, so give it a good minute that looks great.
it 's really nice and smooth, now.
i 've got my oil up to temperature, i can kind of already gauge what temperature should be at an onion in there.
if it 's got color right away, and if it, if it 's bubbling up for it away and then it 's good using a thermometer you want this to be about three seventy five.
so this is all this is what i 'm going to do with them.
dip my onion ring in my batter.
that 's what you 're looking for.
and i 'm just going to continue to do this.
and then cook them for just a couple of minutes until the developer.
good golden brown color.
and then i 've got a baking pan here just some paper towels on it.
because i want to put the cooked on your rings, all not to drain any excess oil and do it in batches.
because you do n't want to overcrowd the pan otherwise it 's going to defeat the purpose of being nice and crispy.
because you 'll drop the temperature of the oil and do n't get really soggy to be patient my friend, so you gonna last two off, off, ah.
i know, i know it 's killing me too, because i know i ca n't eat the whole thing to look at them.
this one actually want this one little tiny ones like this are my favorite who is my account going from one.
more recently i do n't like on your ring stepped in anything.
my husband would probably choose catch up.
let me know what your favorite thing is to dip on your rings in.
but that 's it and they 're very simple and easy to put together, i do n't know much more going to come get the recipe as always.
i 'll see you next time.
