i 'm going to show you a recipe for the most fantastic cottage pie.
you 're going to absolutely love it, it 's full of veggies super healthy.
not only with the kids enjoy it, it 'll be really good for them to over here.
i 've got potatoes and pass them both come up together.
and i 'm going to stick that in some boiling water, OK.
so not just potatoes is a mix of potatoes, M partner, well, that comes up to the boil, which is going to be out, shopping for the pie.
i 'm going to prepare the filling, so into a really hot pan.
i 've got some beef mince i 'm going to go ahead and spread that in they can hear how hot japan was OK.
so i 'm just going to break that up bunch of beef has had a couple of minutes to get nice and brown.
what you do is you take it out.
we 're going to strain it, and then take a little bit of the fat offered the pen back onto the heat.
we 're going to let the heat buildup in there again.
and so it 's nice and hot.
and take my onions with medallic, and my timer give it a good story.
i have a whole lot of butternut pumpkin, and i also have some carrots.
so we 're going to add this now to the onions.
and that 's going to cook down, so the pies got plenty of veggies both inside and in the crust right.
so , once you carrots, and pumpkin have had about five minutes to start sweating down and, and soften up a little bit.
i 've got some tomato paste here and what this is going to do is bring a real richness to my price.
so , throw that in.
and it 's important that you sort of cook this out a little bit before you add your beef stock.
OK , what you 're going to do is you 're going to roast it.
and it 's going to take a little bit of that natural bitterness that is in that.
some are OK, so let 's get that little girl student, i love this dish is so special to me.
my mom used to make a beautiful shepherds pie, and i could always remember when i walk into other house.
and i 'd smell that she 'd bring cooking now.
i was so happy and i still am today when i make it myself, so, once you tomato paste, is roasted out just for a minute or two and you know that you can sort of see it 's starting to stick to the pan, a little bit, just how you want it, the.
next thing you do is grab your beef stock.
add that to your pants.
and then add you brief back in.
if you pull that off without just dumping at all in you 'll see what juice is left now if it 's very oily.
you might want to discard it if it 's not too bad.
you might be happy just to add it back in.
there 's not too much oil on that, so i 'm going to pull the whole thing back is lots of flavor there.
so now that you 've got your beef and beef broth back in there you want to get yourself a lid and cover it, you 're going to simmer it.
so you can turn it down just a little for about fifteen to twenty minutes.
so i 'll be from vegetable mixes, got about ten, fifteen minutes to, to go.
but our potatoes and parsnips are now done.
so i 'm going to send those off strain the water live that back up, so, while there potatoes and pasta steaming dry here i have just a little butter and some milk in a saucepan.
i 'm going to warm that up.
and we go ahead and add all of your bitch back into the pan.
now if you want to do something, fancy like they do in restaurants.
you can get one of these food rice is push it through little become really smooth and perfect.
and that 's how i love to do my mashed potato from serving it with a steak or something like that.
but for a dish like this, a couple of lumps are absolutely fine.
so i 'm going for the old conventional potato masher, just getting there.
and give it a quick open knock up together right.
so , once you 've given that a good old mashup, let 's season it.
plenty of salt and then grab that milk and butter and then i 'm just going to slowly add that OK little bit of elbow grease.
i have a little taste, young tiny bit muscle.
you notice i season the top salt because i do n't want those little flexor pepper in there that i season the base with lots of pepper.
let 's have a look at it.
look at that delicious and rich, beautiful.
so just a little bit of salt in there and then planning a pepper rights we are.
so once this has a beautiful consistency, make sure you have a taste.
so over here i 'm going to pull up my full little dishes and literally just come on over spoon.
this straight Y divided evenly between the four ramekins, auditions, so the next thing we do is get our mashed potato and parsnip.
and we just sort of add that for the top of each of their pie dishes brewery full.
now , of course, you can do this.
so many different ways, piping bag.
and pipe it in and make it look all fancy where you can keep the super rustic.
he can make it nice and smooth.
this is the way i like it.
what i do is i just get a little bit on top of each one and then i kind of just push it around spread out like that.
i quite like it.
when there 's a little bit of text jacket.
so , actually just go over the top there.
because then you get all these little crispy bits potato which i just love brush with just a little melted butter.
the beautiful thing about making college prize or shepherds.
price for that matter is you can make them up in a batch, you might only want to serve one or two tonight, and then you can probably others in the fridge the perfect meal, served your family comes home a different times.
OK , i 'm going to put these in the oven, one hundred ninety degrees for about fifteen to twenty look at these little beauties there 's.
so delicious, and i love it.
when those potatoes go so delicious and crispy.
likely it is, you put all that tomato paste into the actual base of deploy.
you really do n't need to service tomorrow source as a kid and i used to love with travis or not going to lie.
but i think these runs just fine as they are for, for, for piping hot.
