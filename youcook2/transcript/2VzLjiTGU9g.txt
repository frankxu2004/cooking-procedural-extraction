to start make sure all of your ingredients already you 'll want to have.
oregano , basil crushed tomatoes crushed red pepper.
heavy whipping cream, romano cheese grated garlic penne butter and pursuit.
then turn the heat on the water and let that come to a nice boil.
it 'll be awhile so you have plenty of time to get your source ready to cut up your pursuit.
just make a bunch of slices through it kind of crisscross kind of like cutting up waffles, you get a nice little square chunks, like this, got the pursuit into little squares, kind of like you 're cutting up pancakes this way and this way there.
we are all our pursuit is nice and chopped up an shredded.
that 's the way we want.
i used a half a pound, you can use a quarter pound.
all depends how much you want if you have you want to use a large and deep saucepan and see that 's nice and, nice and deep, and you.
gonna put in about two tablespoons really hard to do this with one hand and you 're going to put that in there over my shit and.

and you got to put that in.
and you 're going to melt that, OK, a little bit of garlic open up OK, and the presume.
and then brown that up can crushed tomatoes, crushed red pepper basil and oregano and let that simmer for awhile.
