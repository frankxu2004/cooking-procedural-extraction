welcome to clean eating with claudia and has fits.
i 'm going to kitchen demonstrating how to make baked keenwah, falafel, patties.
these falafels are wonderful because they 're packed full of fiber protein and are low.
calorie do n't write down any of the directions are ingredients just click on this link that 's available in the video description this will send you to has fit dot com.
we have everything laid out for you.
let 's get started begin by preheating your oven to three hundred and fifty degrees i 'm taking one fifteen ounce.
can of chickpeas that i 've drained and imputing them directly into the food processor and to the chick, peas were going to add one clove of finely chopped garlic?
just add that right on into the food processor with your chick peace, and i 'm going to blend these together for about ten to fifteen seconds in the food.
processor your blended chick peas and garlic should look a little something, like this.
let 's combine all of our falafel ingredients together.
i 'm going to start with the chick peas that i blended in the food processor and will add them into a separate bowl.
just make sure you scrape all of the chick peas out of your food processor bowl.
next i 'm going to add one quarter of a cup of finely, chopped red onion.
next i 'm going to add two tablespoons of finely chopped fresh.
and then i 'm going to add one eighth of a teaspoon to a quarter of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, just for a little extra heat, you can omit this ingredient if heat is not what you want for your falafels.
i 'll go ahead and give all of these ingredients.
quick mix and next.
i 'm going to add one third of a cup of cooked quinoa, and i 'm also going to add one whisked egg to the mixture as well, now, if you want to make this a vegan recipe you can certainly just add one tablespoon of an egg replacer.
next i 'm going to add a liberal amount of pink himalayan sea salt and cracked black pepper about a quarter of a teaspoon of each.
i 'm going to mix all of the ingredients together until we get the consistency of a thick taste, and this is what it should look like when you 're all done.
you can use a baking sheet.
but i 'm going to be using a shallow skillet now.
whatever it is that you decide to use just be sure that you 've given a generous spray with a non stick cooking spray.
now to form our falafel, patties.
i 'm going to take about two tablespoons of the falafel mixture into my hands, and i 'm going to form it into the shape of a traditional falafel patty as you see here.
place it on your baking sheet and continue until all of the mixture is gone.
this recipe will yield about nine to twelve falafel, patties just depending on the size that you make them, i 'm going to pop the falafels into the oven for approximately thirty minutes, halfway through i 'm going to take the falafels out and flip them over a place.
he 's back into the oven for an additional fifteen minutes to finish baking, and this is what you 're keen.
wah falafel, patties will look like when they 're all done.
these falafel, patties are delicious on their own.
they also make a great addition to any salad, but taste even better.
when they 're paired with my greek yogurt sauce be on the lookout because i 'll be posting this recipe rule soon.
