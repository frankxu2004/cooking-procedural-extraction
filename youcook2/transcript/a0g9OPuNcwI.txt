this week i made a vegan version of one of my favorite korean dishes.
this is bibimbap or in this case, vegan, bap.
i 'm going to show you how to do it right now on the aimless cook B bim, BAP takes a lot of prep.
but you can make extra ahead of time and have enough for whenever you get a craving.
we 're going to start with about ten to twelve dried.
she talkies and reconstitute them in a bowl with boiling water to cover when there done drain and squeeze out the excess moisture with a kitchen paper, then slice them discarding the woody stems put the slices in a small sauce pan with oil, two tablespoons, each of soy sauce shaoxing cooking wine in brown sugar add a splash of hot water and stir it up to get things going on medium heat and simmer until the liquid is absorbed, when that 's done, take it off the heat and set aside and take a bunch of fresh spinach washed and rinsed, and blanch in boiling salted water for both thirty seconds my shock.
it in cold water drain and squeeze out the access moisture put into a large mixing bowl and season with soy and sesame E oil at a pinch of salt to taste garnish with sesame E, seeds and then set aside OK.
let 's start with our gochujang sauce.
in a mixing bowl combine a teaspoon of sesame E oil with a tablespoon of gochujang and a teaspoon of soy sauce to that.
add a teaspoon and half of honey and a splash of hot water whisk together.
combine in, give it a taste.
it should be spicy at this point, but will balance out when combined with all of the other ingredients.
add some sesame E seeds mix well, and then let 's make our cilantro garlic sauce.
normally , this sauce is n't in a traditional bibimbap, but i like it.
so in a food processor blender at a half a bunch of fresh cilantro in a tablespoon of roasted garlic puree, and i can check out how i made this by clicking on the link in the annotation that put in the juice of one lime and blend too, and i spaced when you have your paste, keep blending on low speed and slowly drizzle in a quarter cup of canola oil till you have yourself a nice emulsion season with a pinch of salt and then set aside, we just need to lightly stir fry some julian carrots and fresh sprouts, separately in a little bit of sesame E oil, you only need to cook them for about thirty seconds.
now you can easily make this with either ground pork or beef but today.
we 're going to use some smoked tofu to make it vegan.
now , simply you dice it in stir fry briefly to heat through now.
let 's move on to the assembly, start with a nice big bull.
you 're going to need room to mix everything together when you serve.
put in a couple scoops of steamed rice and then drizzle, but go to jenn sauce and cilantro garlic sauce on each side.
after that assembled of vegetables on top arranging neatly like o'clock, keep an eye on your colors and keep everything vibrant.
lastly , put your protein in this case are tofu in the center.
and , then top with more gochujang sauce and sesame E seeds.
now when you 're ready to eat simply mix everything together and enjoy very hardy incredibly colorful delicious.
