hello , folks today we are sharing our recipe for sauerkraut, sauerkraut is an essential condiment in german cuisine.
it 's something that we prepare quite often here at the RAF in-house sauerkraut is composed of two things salt, and cabbage.
and they are pickled and fermented for about a week at a time in large batches, and it 's a great way to preserve cabbage and to have a nice condiment to use for hot dogs or hamburgers or whatever you like.
and here 's how we make it, i have two cabbages.
i 've got a red one and a green one.
i 've also got carrots, onion, garlic, and our flavoring agents, which are red, chili flakes little bit of dried dill and two tablespoons of sea salt.
i 'm using one tablespoon per cabbage that 's basically how it works out.
and it 's quite simple.
all we do is we take these ingredients.
we chop them up, toss them together, and we put them in a big crock, and we weigh them down until we get an ice brine and it ferments for about a week and after that, you 're blessed with a brilliant, brilliantly colored sauerkraut and it keeps quite well, so.
let 's get started.
OK , i like to prepare my salt.
first two tablespoons of sea salt as i said before kosher salt is another good choice for this kosher salt has unique abilities to draw out moisture from vegetables or meats and that could be used also.
so i 'm going to add some of my chili flakes.
and then i 'll add a little bit of my dried.
dill , and remember the herbs and spices that you use for this are up to you.
i take this and i just crunch it all up together.
creature , and if you like sauerkraut, you might want to try kimchi recipes as well, because there 're kimchi recipes.
that call for all kinds of ingredients.
really exotic stuff.
we do n't deviate too much from the two basic ingredients, which are salt and cabbage.
OK , so i 've got that mixed up set that aside now if we use two heads of green cabbage will end up with green sauerkraut.
two heads of the red cabbage will have a nice deep purple sauerkraut.
but you combine, you combine the two together, and you get something that 's just lightly pink and it 's really quite gorgeous.
and so, as far as chopping this stuff it 's really quite simple.
we 're going to chop into big chunks, discarding the core.
we 're going to process these in the food processor.
so we have that coarsely chopped going to transfer these to a handy dandy food processor.
but and that 's what we 're looking for, and all of our ingredients are going to go into this big bowl we 're going to mix them in the bowl before we transfer them to our big crock to ferment jesus.
so again, coarsely chopped into the food processor.
not too much.
we do n't want to overcrowd.
it does not look nice.
so cabbages all chopped it 's in our big bowl.
we move on to the carrots.
gorgeous , gorgeous organic carrots so that 's what we 're looking for.
and we will add are diced onion.
not a lot.
and are diced, garlic again.
maybe a clove onion and garlic are rather powerful ingredients, so we only use just a little bit just to add that little underlying flavor which i like.
and toss it altogether.
so the salt is going to draw some of that moisture, out of the cabbage, cabbage does have a lot of moisture.
so does the onion carats do as well.
so the salt will draw out that moisture, and as it sits, in that croc will put a little bit of weight on it, and a brian will start to form, and we want that brian to rise above the vegetables here.
and when it 's, it 's there 's just enough salt that it will prevent any nasty bacteria from growing.
but not so much that it will prevent lactic acid from being produced and.
so the wild airborne bacteria and yeasts will start to work away at the cabbage and it 'll ferment for about a week and after that, you 've got gold sauerkraut another pickled things are often presented in a crock like this ceramic crock, and these are nice.
i like these, but what i actually prefer is this clear pyrex dish.
cool thing about the pyrex is that as this thing is sitting you can check on it every day, only have to do is look right through that clear pyrex.
and you can see how your crowd is doing.
so it 's a nice way to check up on your pickles now with our handy potato masher.
we match this down and by doing this.
we 're also helping to release some of the moisture from these, or just vegetables you 'll notice as you press down.
see some of that liquid coming up.
that 's when you know, you 've done a good job here.
and what you want to do is you want to find a plate that 's just, just barely going to fit inside your container.
OK will put that down press in you see, that you see that brian coming up.
that 's exactly what we 're looking for gotta press, kind of hard, on that and to keep this way down a mason jar seems to do the trick filled with water and to keep bugs from getting in.
i like to use a pillow case to cover this with will put that pillow case over just like.
so , and in winter months we like to leave this at room temperature.
because it 's a little bit cool in winter months will leave this at room temperature for all maybe eight or nine days, and that usually is enough time for this thing to prevent properly and pickle as it should in summer months when it 's warmer.
if you leave it out at room temperature, it might be done in five or six days, but will probably leave this for about eight.
maybe nine days check on it periodically like this, this is again why i like using the clear dish and the pillow case.
i can just kind of peek underneath it and just see how everything is going.
so when windows eight days are up will check on it, it should be finished there might be a little bit of mold on the top.
but we can just scrape that off, and we can store them in large glass containers like this, they will stay in the fridge for about a year.
typically , you 'll eat it before then, but this is a great way to preserve vegetables.
they really do last a long time when your sauerkraut is finished.
the , the possibilities again are endless.
you can put the sauerkraut on just about anything.
hot dogs are nice.
anything , anything barbecue hot dogs hamburgers steak.
it 's all fair game, but we like to do is take a loaf of whole grain.
sourdough take your bread, which we may toast, we may not take a little bit of mayonnaise, or maybe a little bit more mannings and on top of the mayonnaise.
we add our finished sauerkraut and this my friends is a delicious, delicious, little snack.
this is how we do it at the RAF in the house.
we hope you try, and we hope you like it.
