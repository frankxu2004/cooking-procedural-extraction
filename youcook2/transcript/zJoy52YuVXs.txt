so let 's start with the sort of almost the simplest pizza that everybody loves called pizza margherita, which is just you are very simple.
tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, some parmesan and a few basil leaves, you know, there are a lot of charred sauces on the market.
i do n't particularly like them.
i think they 're too sweet and too heavy and too heavily season.
so all i do is i take a can of tomatoes.
this cost, two dollars and twenty.
five cents add some salt and put it through this gizmo, which is a food mill.
if you do n't have a food mill, you can just crush them with your hands.
so we just put our food mill over a bowl during the tank.
this is a great activity for kids, actually turning the crank on this, or even better crushing with their hands just have a towel ready.
so see, we 've broken up the tomatoes.
but we have n't pureed them, so then two teaspoons of kosher salt and just mix that are for a pizza this size.
i would say a third of a cup of sauce.
is the most you want to use.
an the first time you do it and measure, or you 're going to end up using too much just only about that much and spread it around, leaving a border in about an inch to a half inch on the side.
it does n't seem like enough, but trust me, it is then the parmesan again.
about a third of a cup just sort of a nice handful and then mozzarella.
but just a few slices.
and you do n't want to cover the whole surface in the pizza, you know, that 's really enough.
a few basil leaves four five is enough.
so simple, delicious beautiful, the colors of the italian flag so then we put it into our very hot oven.
i use a pizza stone on the oven.
but if you do n't have one again just turn a baking sheet upside down and put it in the oven and get it.
nice and hot you want this to go immediately on to a hot surface.
so will just slide it in here.
and cook for six to eight minutes, so here we go our pizza margherita.
this looks good.
the crust is nice and brown.
the cheese is melted has running all over the pizza and will just dress it with just a little olive oil.
