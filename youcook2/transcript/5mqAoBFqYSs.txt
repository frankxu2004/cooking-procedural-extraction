aloha and welcome to caitie, kitchens.
i 'm chef michi.
and today i 'm going to show you how to make vietnamese style, pork patty pita sandwiches let 's start with the ingredients for our ingredients today.
the pork patties we 're going to use ground pork some ginger.
garlic , sweet chilli sauce minced water chestnuts.
some sliced green onion and cilantro or chinese parsley, and then we 're going to make a really nice sauce with fat free greek yogurt, some low fat mayonnaise she ra cha sweet chilli sauce, an again green onions, then when we make our PDF sandwiches, we 're going to use some japanese cucumber, shallots shredded cabbage and fresh mint leaves and these are all going to go in our whole wheat.
pita pockets, so, let 's get started.
we 're going to start off by making the pork patties were just going to combine all these ingredients together.
you got the pork this fresh ginger, and garlic just adds such a nice flavor in there, sweet chili sauce.
it all just goes together.
and we 're going to blend it, and then we 're going to make the patties.
the water chestnuts at a nice little crunch in there.
the green onions and cilantro, they add green as well as some flavor.
so all we do.
now actually is just want to kind of mix it around, you can mix it for a bit with your spoon.
but to be honest, you really do need to get in there.
and , because it 's rob pork.
i am going to put some gloves on that.
i 'll just give me a good chance to blend all of that together.
if you do n't have gloves again, you can use your bare hands.
just make sure after to wash your hands very thoroughly with warm water and soap.
so you do n't want to over, over mix this just kind of lightly mix everything together, there.
and we 're going to make little patties.
you want to grab about the size of a walnut and roll it into a ball.
i 've already pre sprayed this pan right here with some cooking spray, and that will allow the patties to not stick.
also , helps them to brown a little bit.
so we 're going to create a lot of these little patties, and then we 're going to put him into a three hundred and fifty degree oven will be baking them for fifteen minutes on one side, then we 're going to just flip him over for another ten minutes.
so both sides will get nice and brown.
so now that the patties are all portioned out i 'm going to put them in the oven, now, while the pork patties are cooking we 're going to make our sauce for our pita sandwiches.
i like to use the fat free greek yogurt.
this is a really nice way to make a beautiful sauce.
it does n't have all the calories of mayonnaise.
i mix the yogurt with mayonnaise.
all that flavor does permeates into the yogurt and you 've got a lighter sauce is just a little trick that i like to use going to add some si racha.
i do like that spicy goodness.
some sweet chili and green onions.
this adds color flavor just mix this sauce together.
these are going to go into the P.
does it gives it a little moisture and a lot of flavor.
it 's going to go perfect with those vietnamese pork patties.
so we 've just taken the vietnamese pork patties out of the oven there beautifully brown on both sides.
because we did flip them partway through that.
just helps both sides to get nicely brand.
so for the assembly of these pita sandwiches you just take a peter and i like to layer it.
so that it 's easy to eat, and all the flavors are going to kind of meld together, if you want to start off with a little cabbage that 's kind of the bed it 's going to hold that pork patty in there.
we want to put about two per porpita, open this up along more, then you 're going to put some sauce radon to that patty amazing, fairly quick to make.
so it 's a quick meal super crunchy and healthy some cucumber.
the fresh mint is just beautiful.
anna little bit of shallots and then, we 're going to keep assembling all these sandwiches, and i ca n't wait to try one.
now is my favorite part.
i 'm just going to take a little taste that is delicious.
the pork patty with the sauce the crunchy cucumber in them.
it all goes so well , together.
this would pair really great with a sparkling rozee for this recipe and more, please visit KT a superstores dot com slash recipes thank you for joining me at katie, a kitchens i 'm chef michi , aloha.
