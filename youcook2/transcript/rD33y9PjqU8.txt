we 're going to do a very, very traditional dish of ireland, an it 's cool cotton and there 's as many ways as there is mothers to make cool clan and this is the way my grandmother made it for maine.
so you start with a warm pan with butter.
he had some potato.
some cabbage, some onion and traditionally they, you scale.
