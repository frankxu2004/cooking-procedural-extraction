hey guys hallelujah, my legs in today i 'm showing you a very iconic dish from ponce, the cock, miss you i will show you the full crack classics.
the first afterwards, maybe a little twist on it, please show some surprise, at least the cosmos is on which is crispy outside.
and melt inside, and, you know, what it can be done in under ten minutes, which is quite phenomenal for french dish.
you want to do it now.
you do n't want to do it.
i do it.
let 's do it, test stuff grab two thick slices of sandwich bread lay them flat in front of yuan better them on one side only for the first slice, plays the better side down at a slice of cheese.
i 'm using contain here to keep it really french, but feel free to go for chatter material.
are you name it, then goes a slice of hub?
i will use higher westerpark.
i will use higher welfare pop.
but this is the autosuggestion method.
i think it will work.
i believe so afterwards another slice of cheese.
you see, the cheese is the glue of this sandwich, finishing with the other slice of bread this time better side to stateless equally grilled cheese sandwich in a pan and not in a toaster like i did in the past with some fast success.
but do n't get me wrong.
i still believe that the two star method is the less chaotic one unless your kitchen starts to build, and left your kitchen starts to burn right, and it starts to spread and let your kitchen starts to burn right, and it starts to spread and let your kitchen starts to burn right, and it starts to spread frying pan on medium heat.
sandwich goes in and simply cover it loosely, with aluminium foil.
but check at the end, it should be golden and crispy.
do n't rush it, meaning do not set the heat too high, otherwise it will burn?
so , personally, i do like the cognition as it is nothing more but sometimes people find it to dry so.
let 's make a white and creamy sauce to go with it in french.
we call it bechamel sauce, but do n't be scared really.
be cause i do have the perfect cheats on it to microwave safe cups.
one tablespoon better in the first one and a good dash of milk in the second one.
put them in the microwave for one minute and a half afterwards.
one tablespoon flour goes in the batter mix, well, an add the hot milk, then pop this mix twenty to thirty seconds in the microwave to thicken up at the end.
it 's eighty percent similar to a fancy french bishamon source.
but for only twenty percent of the original time OK.
so how to play this up well in paris it 's often done like.
so spread with bechamel sauce and broil until golden, uh, well, i 'm afraid this is idiot , well.
there are many issues with it, i mean, we made a crispy and golden sandwich and now all you end up with is a soggy and burned edge sandwich.
so , instead i will share with you, the only way to get the best of both worlds.
his penis london monster world, get the kokam assuming two fingers and put some bishamon source in an egg cup.
boiled egg and soldiers.
this is the inspiration right before eating.
it did the soldier in the source and my word on it most jerannchris, penis guaranteed each time, so guys.
i told you cognition is nothing complex, and, you know, it might even looks a bit simplistic in a way.
but keep in mind that simplicity is the your teammates sophistication.
i really hope you enjoy this recipe, so like comment, share and subscribe, people bye, bye sorry.
