hey guys and welcome back to crouton, crackerjacks today.
i 'm going to show you how to make your very own pepperoni, cheesy bites pizza, the pizza hut way at home.
this pizza is super easy to make, do n't be fooled by thinking of super hard?
it 's very easy.
if you can make a regular pepperoni pizza, you can make this.
so for this recipe, you 're going to need some homemade pizza dough, you could also use store, bought refrigerated, if you like.
but i have a separate video that shows how i make my pizza dough.
i will put a link to that down below need some shredded mozzarella cheese.
you 're also going to need pizza sauce, of course again.
you could use homemade, or prevod, you 're also going to need pepperoni or toppings of your choice, some string cheese melted butter and garlic powder.
so let 's get started.
i 've only got ahead and made up my pizza to an.
i 've covered that let it rise for an hour until it was doubled in size and.
now i 'm going to place this onto a sixteen inch pizza pan lot of people have asked me on my previous pizza videos where i get my pizza pans.
this is just two dollar, walmart pizza pan.
it 's made of aluminum.
it 's super thin and lightweight which is exactly what you want for pizza.
let 's the heat go right through the piano right to the crust.
so you get a nice evenly done.
but you want to put your pizza dough all the way out, to the edges of your pan, and i 'm just using my fingertips to do this work around the dough.
evenly , so it stays circular.
and you just want to get this out until it goes about a half inch or.
so beyond the edge of the pan.
because we 're actually going to be folding the edges up and over around, cheese you get your crust spread all the way out.
you want to take some string cheese.
this is just the regular old, individually wrapped string cheese that you can buy it for like a quarter apiece.
go ahead and unwrap those.
i 'm using eight pieces for this sixteen inch pizza going to place those evenly around the edge of the crust and then you want to take the very edge of the crust and fold that up and over your cheese sticks and caps, lighting them completely.
and once you get those completely encapsulated, go around and press down the crust make sure that those edges are sealed no air pockets or anything in there you want the dough wrapped tightly around the cheese tags, then i 'm going to take a knife and you can actually see where the individual sticks are.
you want to cut between the sticks and then cut each stick into three equal pieces.
it does not have to be perfect, just eyeball.
this there 's no need to get out of ruler and measure anything.
just eyeball it close enough is good enough for this, and then to actually form the crown of cheesy bites if you will.
you just want to take each piece.
here what up and flip it ninety degrees.
when you turn these over make sure that, that sealed side where the seam is of the dough stays on the bottom.
so that way when you bake it sealed that they do n't come undone and just go around and turn each of these pieces.
they do n't have to be touching.
it 's perfectly fine.
if there 's space between them.
that 's actually preferable because this dough will kind of rise and spread out as it bakes and now.
we can go ahead and build the toppings on our pizza just take my pizza sauce here again.
i will put a link that shows how i make that down below, it 's super simple.
it 's tomato paste.
water basil oregano onion powder, garlic powder salt.
i think, but i 'll put the recipe down below for that.
i 'm using about a half a cup or so of sauce and just using the back of the spoon.
i 'm going to spread an even layer of this all the way across the bottom of my pizza dough.
you want to make sure that, that sauce goes all the way up to the edges of the pizza bites.
but do n't go real heavy on those pizza sauce too.
much sauce ends up making like a soggy crust.
and that 's not good.
so just use a thin layer.
and then i 'm going to top this with some shredded mozzarella cheese.
now a lot of people ask me how i get my cheese with a melting.
the secret is, i great my own mozzarella cheese.
just by the block of low moisture, mozzarella cheese grated on a greater pre.
shredded stuff has cellulose on it, which kind of impedes the melty, ness of the cheese.
so whenever you can, if you are going to melt cheese by the block of cheese and shred it yourself i ended up using about six ounces of cheese here.
you just want to spread that evenly again all the way to the edges of the cheesy bites, and then i 'm going to stop my pizza with pepperoni, you could use whatever toppings that you wish i 'm just keeping it simple and using pepperoni when you do use pepperoni.
because pepperoni shrinks up in the oven, when you bake it place your pepperoni slices close together almost overlapping them a little bit, and go as heavy on the pepperoni as you bought this.
is your pizza your time to make it?
how you want pizza in a preheated four hundred and fifty degree fahrenheit oven, and you want to bake this for about twelve minutes, or so, you want to make it until the crust is nicely golden brown, the cheese is nicely melted, and it just starts to brown a little bit on the top.
and once everything is nicely golden brown, you can go ahead and remove it from your oven and.
because i like softon, squishy bread, especially with cheesy bites, i 'm just going to take a little bit of melted butter and using a pastry brush just brush the tops of these with butter that 's going to make these cheesy bites and softap.
you do n't have to do this, if you do n't want to, but this is how i 'm doing it.
but once i got that covered with the melted butter.
i 'm just going to sprinkle a little bit of garlic powder right on top.
now if you were smart, you would have mixed.
the garlic powder with the.
butter , but i was not thinking when i made this.
so i 'm just going to bring a little garlic powder right on top.
but then, go ahead and cut this into slices and serve it up, but there you go.
that is how you make a cheesy.
bites pepperoni pizza, the pizza hut way, and if you wanted to you could substitute for the cheese, and you can make yourself a hot dog, bites pizza works the exact same way here 's a picture of that for you and there you go.
impress your husband or wife, impress your children.
make yourself a pizza at home from scratch.
it 's super easy super delicious, definitely worth it.
