hello , and happy holidays.
i 'm at least in the B team and today, i 'm going to give you a tiny peek into my family 's christmas eve traditions.
so we often celebrate some polish traditions on christmas eve like sharing oplatky an cristicchi and of course who rogez, who does n't look for hoagies they are a polish dumpling often stuff with potatoes or with meat or sauerkraut and today, we 're making potato perogies from scratch.
i 'm going to start by mixing the wet ingredients together in this large bowl.
i have egg yolks.
three quarters of a cup of sour cream.
we actually strained it to get any excess moisture out.
so we put in a strainer over a bowl and put it in the fridge for maybe twenty minutes, little longer.
if you can, and one stick of softened butter mix it all together.
now a little bit at a time going to start to add in the flour here on the side i have two cups of flower that i sucked it.
and you do n't want to add it all in at once.
because you may not have to use all of it getting to the point where i can really get rid of the spatula, and i need to get in there with my hands.
so the perogy dough was come together.
i formed it into a disk, and i 'm going to cut it in half and wrap up each individual piece with saran wrap and put them in the fridge.
well , our joe is made, it 's in the fridge.
it should be in there for at least two hours.
it can be in there for as long as two days.
luckily i made some last night, so i 'm ready to go this often enough a little bit.
always rotate now we 're just rolling the dough out, and we 're looking for it to be about an eighth of an inch think.
next step we 're cutting circles into the dough to make our pro geese.
so try to get all the air out of there and finally work it this entire perogy recipe, including the potato filling is available on bobby flay dot com the pro keys are together they are ready to go into this pot of boiling water will put a few at a time after doing some testing, we discovered that once you put them into the water and they rise to the top after time exactly four minutes, and then get them out just.
so they do n't overcook try to keep them away from each other and also from the sides of the pot.
now we 're just going to lightly brown each side in a pin with some butter in salt and pepper little.
so let 's stop them with some karma lies onions in some fresh, chopped parsley.
so there you have it forget those frozen perogies at the store and make your own.
it taste so much better and it 's really pretty simple, too, as you saw.
