hi , guys alarm italian, on this episode of lori indication i want to share with you a recipe for what i call like french fried onions, or just fried onion strings now, i know.
i made onion rings here.
not too long ago.
but i wanted to share this recipe with you because it 's really, really easy.
an because thanksgiving is right around the corner no that in america here, we love our green bean casserole.
and most people topic with those french fried onions that come in a, can i think it 's my control freak?
nis that comes out when i have to make them from scratch.
because i do n't like using a lot of things that have cans and french fried onions are one of those things i love to make it home.
and there 's so easy.
you 'll need some onions.
of course, you 'll need some whole milk and then just some flower with some salt, black pepper granite onion.
paprika and some vegetable oil for frying lowes and bought the really easy for us to share it, with you.
because i am going to be showing you a recipe for my green bean casserole here very soon.
and i 'm going to top it with homemade french fried onions, and i know a lot of people, ask me for the recipes.
i figured mine is well now.
normally you use one or two really big onions i do n't have any really big onion, so i 'm just using the biggest onions.
i have and what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to cut the top and bottom and then just get rid of the very first layer, and.
now i know, most people use buttermilk.
can i use buttermilk?
when i make my onion rings for the point about these for me is that there 's.
so thin, and they hardly had any real thick coding on them, keeping them super, super crispy.
and i find buttermilk is to thicken.
it coats the onions too much.
just my thinking what i 'm going to do is thinly slice these onions.
i want these onions to be as thin as i possibly can manage.
they do n't have to be perfectly round that you just wanted to be as thin as you can manage.
i do n't really use amanda links.
i really find main ones to be really dangerous.
i did cut myself once i cut off a good chunk of my thumb, so i have n't really used one since so.
i just say get it as soon as you can with your knife.
do you best as you can see?
i went kind of an angle here a little bit to get some thinner strips.
i 'm only going to do one for today is because there 's not really upset right now, onions.
always make me cry i ca n't help it.
the key is to really get them instant as you can.
and then i just take my little rounds and i kind of make a little slit in them like this.
so that when they fries just a whole lovely thin string of goodness and.
now i 'm going to cover these with some milk just whole milk and these are going to sit in the milk for about an hour or.
so and then when there 's already, i will show you the.
next step, my onions have been soaking for about an hour.
i 've got some vegetable oil up to three hundred and seventy five degrees in a little pot here, and.
now i want to do is just are my flower together with my pep rica in my onion powder.
now i wanted to add onion powder, especially in this.
because i feel like when you taste those french fried onion soup really taste like onions, and i want to kind of get, you know, it 's like a hum on the back of the back of your mouth when you 're tasting this.
because there 's something.
so a lot of the onion flavored does come out but trust me when i tell you.
these are going to be fantastic.
so now i 'm going to do now as i 'm going to do this a few other time.
i also have a plate here with some paper towel just to catch when i put them on.
i do n't want any of the oil and i just take a few out of time and as you can see there.
not sort of heavily, heavily coated they 're just lightly coated, put that into my hot oil and let those cook for a few minutes until the really nice and crispy and then when they are done that will take no time and when they are ready, just put him on your paper towel lines plate, and just keep on going last batch and of course, i know, i do n't have to tell you that we 've already been snacking on number.
so good that 's the thing about when you 're working with fried food, which is why i do not do it very often, at all you tend to never leave the scene of the crime i mean, you just stand right here into the pick and, pick, and pick is at its best when i have it comes out of the fryer 's with a frying oil, wanna make sure you season them.
so , as soon as they come out at the oil, i can tease this one down here.
come on for nominal.
they 're delicious chris peter.
max , so do n't have a very strong onion flavor or just fabulous, if we do n't really like that strong flavor.
but these are going to be perfect as is to munch on, on top of my home in green bean casserole.
it is out of this world.
delicious to laura in the kitchen dot com.
get this recipe.
i feel giving very funny stomach pains, and i will see you next time.
