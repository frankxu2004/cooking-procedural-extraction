here with the tannery, cookery school, i always emphasize how easy it is to cook good proper simple food.
i want to introduce a recipe.
that 's a particular favor of mind, it 's cottage pie.
but i wanted to cook with my way i have some lovely ingredients here at the best of irish mincemeat.
i have some lovely tomato ketchup.
i have some marinade.
this is a beautiful, beautiful marinade, just because it says marinade.
it does n't mean you have to use it as a marinade only use it as a seasoning for food, so i 'm just going to chop an onion.
and put it into this pan.
also , on imputing in as well, are some bacon lardons, i 've always telling people that let somebody do the work for you, if possible.
and this is a classic example of that is abuse free card smoked.
bacon lardons that i use with pasta sort of things.
but in here unusually i 'm adding these into the courage to given lovely flavor to cook, good food, you, gotta have good projects.
it 's as simple as that, and this beef, it 's a hundred percent irish because you ca n't get better than that.
the secret mashed potatoes in my view, this generosity.
i 'm in fairness, OK, half the time, i worry about my waistline on nearly all the time, but butter and milk make beautiful mashed potatoes.
it 's up to how much water, do you use if you 're feeling naughty, you 've had a bad day at the office.
add a little bit extra, so hot, an irish butter, you can piece is the classic car.
is part of course is mash.
but i wanted to make a different type of mesh, and i also love having an emphasis in irish food and was really irish parishoners?
i 'm going to make a para slip mash topped with cheddar cheese and the depth of flavor that 's in.
here , because of all my lovely ingredients it 'll make a really wild dish.
it would surprise people.
these persons are just going to be put in with the potatoes, and i 'm going to cook everything together, boil them up, and then match them now.
i 'm going to surprise you.
this stuff is really, really brilliant.
i tasted it.
and it was looking for something to use it in.
and that 's quite often what i do anything that you can use in your cooking that you keep in the covered.
this ketchup is fantastic stuff.
it 's smooth not too vinegary.
they 've done taste tests with this ketchup, and it is one.
all around it taste it and see it is really beautiful.
so some salt and pepper in here.
and we nearly done.
hello , mom, i love mash was lovely now to taste, which is hugely important love little bit of water there.
just smiling at me bobby pudding it together.
it 's really easy.
anybody can do it all i 'm going to do is put the minutes into the bottom of the dish, put the match on top and then top it with beautiful, mature irish cheddar, the color will be lovely simply that into a nice hot oven for about fifteen twenty minutes.
and you 're done.
i 'm getting hungry there.
you have it my college page with parsnip mash and lovely melty, cheddar cheese.
