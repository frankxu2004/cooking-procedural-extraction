and along with that there 's some other ingredients like tomatoes and lemon dressing.
however , part of being creative in the kitchen and trying out how amazing wholesome plant foods can be, is to get creative with different versions of certain recipes or certain dishes and.
so when it comes to tabouli, you can really make it in.
i invite you to try a plane to bully, without any of the bulgur or keen wah or any other seat or grain.
i invite you to try the quinoa, tabbouleh that i 'm going to be showing you how to make today, and once you get the hang of how easy and fun it can be, try it with the traditional bulger, you can also try it with something like hemp seeds like buckwheat.
so there 's many variations.
and it 's all up to you as to how creative you want to be, and what suits your taste buds, given time.
so when it comes to this keyword, tabouli salad it is going to be nutrient dense, foley plant.
based or vegan, it is going to be raw aside from the keenwah, which is going to be cooked so you have a choice.
if you want to adhere to a strict raw meal.
then you can use sprouted quinoa or all make the quinoa and or use something like hemp seeds or another sprouted grain like the vulgar are solid is going to be high in fiber extremely high.
in all the nutrients high in our healthy fats, excellent source of protein.
it is going to be high in the right types of carbohydrates pretty much nonexistent when it comes to sugars, but very high when it comes to fiber.
it is also going to be anti oxidant and vital, nutrient rich as are all of our wonderful plant foods.

one of the top features of any leafy green, including the parsley, is that they are.
so upstanding at balancing our internal PH and providing a nice acid alkaline balance in our environment for best help weight loss?
weight maintenance healing and prevention parsley is a nutritional powerhouse, and parsley is usually a leafy green that we use very sparingly, if at all.
so this is where we get through this salad , really.
a high dose of parsley for about of cup of parsley you 're getting just about twenty calories and in that there is no fat.
but two grams some protein above two grams.
but lots and, lots, and lots of minerals and vitamins pretty much minerals from iron to magnesium, to manganese two copper, etc.
really , really high on iron and vitamins.
and it is again packed with pretty much every vitamin, but especially specially dense in vitamins eight C, and K also have some B vitamins.
and some folders so really just a wonderful addition to our diet, and because parsley has a very strong flavor, some people really like it.
but many do not.
and so the tabouli salad allows us to enjoy the amazing nutritional benefits of parsley along some other flavors and in a dish that sort of mellows out that strong parsley flavor, while also bringing out its best, parsley, of course is also very cleansing and detoxifying really amazing all around for healing and prevention, our.
next main ingredient in our kemba, tabouli salad, today is going to be.
of course keen one even though it 's considered a grain really and treated like a grain it 's really a seed that is extremely nutrient dense very high in minerals pretty much again.
every single mineral that we would want to have as part of our diet, and that includes the magnesium and, manganese and the copper and the iron, etc.
also , an excellent source of the B vitamins and that, again helps to promote optimal health with especially our nervous system.
but also, so many other aspects of our health.
so very great for healing and prevention about a cup of keene was going to give us about two hundred calories, and in that is about five grams fiber in about eight grams of protein.
now , some people get very excited about keenwah because they 've heard.
it 's a complete protein and really while it is a fantastic source of plant proteins today as i helped to teach and dispel the myth really.
all plants are excellent sources of protein in an evolving wellness dot com, you can read and S air wrote about the plant protein myths, and when it comes to this idea of still thinking in terms of plant foods, being a complete or incomplete.
so really a wonderful addition to our diet, anytime.
but a great addition also to the quinoa, tabouli salad, another main an traditional ingredient to any tabouli salad, is the tomato the tomatoes of course also full of vitamins, different antioxidants and fire nutrients and very, very rich.
again in vitamin C the.
different B, vitamins, and most of the different minerals another main ingredient in a traditional tabouli salad, is the onion and when it comes to onions we 've heard that they have a lot of antibacterial and antiviral properties and absolutely all that is wonderful.
but onions are also very potent medicinally for us in many ways due to the phyto nutrients that they contain.
so it 's smart to eat them.
but we also have to know when and how much not necessarily overdo it when it comes to onions, of course, high in many of the minerals vitamins as well, including vitamin C, when it comes to emphasizing those amazing flavors and the tabouli salad it is all about the type of dressings that we 're going to be using an.
we 're not talking about any process dressings here.
it 's as simple as using lemon and olive oil, which i 'll talk about in a moment, so i lemon more highly alkalizing properties here, so again.
fantastic to have a tabouli salad.
really anytime you want to boost your alkalinity boost that PH balance boost your cleansing and detoxification stick in the spring and summer, and of course, high in different minerals vitamins, we know lemons are famous for the vitamin C.
so much more in terms of the antioxidants, they provide the phyto nutrients and all the other benefits that come with being a pole plant food and the other part is of course going to be our olive oil and when it comes to all of oil, we know that it is extremely healthy when it comes to providing us with the right healthy fats.
but we want to make sure that our olive oil to provide us with those benefits quality.
this means organic and extra virgin and the more, you know, about your olive oil and your olive oil company the higher quality that you can choose and the better.
the decision that you can make once you get the hang of making the tabouli salad again, you can stick to a more traditional recipe, or you can really experiment.
and this is what i always try to promote through the health batarian living videos is rather than having rigorous recipes play with your food.
creative , in the kitchen, and what you have on hand, adjust your quantities and different ingredients so a tabouli salad can also include cucumbers.
it can also include some bell peppers.
it can also include garlic.
some sea salt some black pepper.
you can use some human you can use some cayenne pepper so again.
play with the recipe, how fun work with whole plant foods to create amazing, healthy and nutritious meals.
the tools you 're going to need for this recipe include a measuring cup, some kind of a large bowl or dish, where you can mix all of your ingredients and some kind of a big spoon or a simple tablespoon, will do, you 're going to need a pot in which to cook your queue up.
you 're going to need a sip, or some kind of a strainer.
but a very fine that you can rinse your quinoa and, you 're going to need a typical cutting board and a good knife.
so that you can cut up your ingredients.
something like a lemon reamer or a lemon juice squeezer is optional in terms of increasing quantities, i 'm going to show you the demonstration of a typical salad that could serve two people for two good servings, or also just to provide a few side servings.
it all depends again if you 're using this as a side as an appetizer or as a whole meal.
so today we 're going to be using one cup of dry quinoa about a bunch of parsley.
now if you get a really big bunch, you can have it, or you can just use a corner of it.
remember it all depends here on your personal preferences.
one onion and your onion can be typical white onion.
it could be a red onion silicon.
play with, what 's available, if you have a really large onion unless you want your key.
once ability to be really oniony.
you can use perhaps half and two tomatoes size wise.
if you use one really large tomato to smaller tomatoes, you could even use three or four tomatoes adjust quantities to your personal needs.
a few tablespoons of olive oil and a dash of our different herbs, spices and sea salt.
we are sourcing out organic ingredients as much as possible as much as available for you in your grocery store at your farmers market or in your area and again local as much as possible.
so when tomatoes and parsley are in season in your area, definitely make use of local sources.
the time it takes to make the skin.
what tabouli salad is about fifteen to twenty minutes.
we 're going to start by cooking are, keen, wah for which takes about fifteen minutes to cook while you 're keen what is cooking.
you 'll be preparing all of the other ingredients and then adding the keyword in when it is ready, so, once you measure out one cup of your keen wah the way to cook quinoa is really to use about one to two in terms of ratios of keen want to water or even sometimes one cup of quinoa to one and a half cups of water.
first step is to rinse the keyword really, really, well.
sometimes people notice that there 's a little bitter taste or flavor to quinoa, i can be remedied by simply rinsing the keyword really, really, well.
next measure of two cups of water place.
it into your pot and begin to heat the water on high until it comes to a boil.
once it comes to a boil simply add the chemo in stir.
it around cover and reduce the heat down to simmer and set your timer for fifteen minutes, while you 're keno is cooking.
we need to finally chop the parsley dice.
the tomatoes and onion and pretty much mixed together with our lemon oil, the final, you chop the parsley.
i tend to find the better the experience.
usually for most people, especially if they 're not a big fan of parsley.
now you can do this by hand, or sometimes, depending on the type of food processor you have you can also try doing it that way.
just be sure to start with all of your vegetables being thoroughly washed and to start with the parsley.
i make sure that all of my ends here outside of the leafy parts are exposed.
and i will cut that off this is generally the part that i will just put in my composter.
this part of the typically recipe to grab, the bunch as tightly as possible, squeezing and squeezing it all together and then guiding as much with your hand.
just the part.
and of course be mindful of where your fingers are and how you 're using your knife mindfully, just starting to chop an moving your fingers ever.
so slightly back while still squeezing the entire bunch of person and we better be nice fine chopping action , going.
so continue with chopping your parsley until it is fully and transfer to your main bull.
next proceed with either the onion or the tomatoes.
the order really does n't matter simply slice the onion into discs.
and once you 've got, these discs of onion usually what i do is layer them in choose.
for example, or threes and then cut both vertically and horizontally in this gives me a nice diced effect.
so now transfer the onions to the parsley bowl.
finally , proceed with the tomatoes.
you can use my method of coring from the top and simply removing the corp.
or i know, sometimes people like to cut into the tomato first and then remove the core and here again.
just like with the onion, i 'm going to slice the tomato and then simply layer them again.
one or two slices, and cut vertically and horizontally to achieve a deist affect.
once you tomatoes or diced, simply transfer them to the bowl and now we are ready to go ahead with our dressing, so with a washed lemon.
what you want to do too for best squeezing or basically to get the most juice out of it is roll the lemon on your cutting board by playing some good pressure to it.
not too much but basically just roll it around then cut the lemon in half and you can remove any seeds manually with a knife or a fork.
now , what i recommend.
because sometimes there are some hidden seeds is to squeeze the juice into a little cup or bowl rather than directly into the salad, if you squeeze your lemon juice into another container, simply transfer it over a surf.
again we any of the pits next will be adding in the olive oil.
and we typically recommend for this type of portion to add about two to four tablespoons and what it may depend on.
is simply if you are interested in increasing the fats and healthy fats that is of course in your diet, or if you are actually looking, at decreasing the amount of oils in your diet.
so today, here, i 'm going to go for the read tablespoons with respect to the sea salt start with less.
because it 's much easier to add more and much harder to cover up.
if we 've gone too much.
so usually i will just sprinkle a few times into the tabouli, we can leave it at that as a traditional tabouli release very simple, based on the olive oil, lemon juice, and sea salt, or we can add a few other herbs and spices and again here i invite you to get creative and play and see what works best for your personal taste buds so, i 'm going to be adding today some black pepper and if you would like to make your tabouli a little more flavorful in terms of spiciness, then i also recommend some cayenne pepper.
and by now when you have finished with your chopping in your adding of your spices, you 're keen.
what should be ready so remove the keyboard from the stove?
and if you do n't mind a warmer tabouli, which i find is actually really nice, sometimes, if you are eating it especially during the colder months then you can add to keenwah immediately.
otherwise , you can wait until the quinoa, cools off or the next day let 's say you cooked your quinoa.
the one evening to use for a different dish, you can use the leftover cooked quinoa when it 's cold the.
next day for a tabouli salad.
so one cup of keyboard that we started with will yield about three cups of cooked quinoa.
we definitely do n't need all of it.
so here again it depends on how much did you make in terms of the ingredients that we 've been using.
how much do you need and what are your preferences.
do you want a heartier salad where you want to use more, or do you want an later salad where you want to use less teamwork to be adding in a boat a cup and a half years about a half of what i have in the pot, and then the final step is really just to store all of the ingredients thoroughly together?
making sure that the lemon juice, the olive oil and all of our herbs or spices that we added mix thoroughly together, and that 's it our beautiful keenwah to belief salad, is all done.
now you are ready to enjoy this highly, highly nutritious and alkalizing cleansing and just health enhancing meal anytime it stores well for a few days i would n't keep it too long.
but usually two days is just fine.
if you wanted to make yourself a bigger portion, and then divide it up into a few meals over the.
next two or three days.
but remembering that fresh is always best to maintain the integrity of our vitamins, including are enzymes etc and just the nutritional life giving power of our food, especially is ryan why we want to eat as many foods in their whole natural raw form, as possible.
now just before you transfer the desired amount into your dish i would give it a quick taste and see if everything is in alignment to your personal preferences and enjoy the many variations of the keyword, tabouli salad.
see you on another episode of health batarian living.
