this is the way forward for mushroom.
this is moon marion year or mussels in white wine, and it 's so simple start with need fresh mussels, so they gotta still be alive.
so , if you take the muscle, just check it with the special possible and alive is going much fresh in there, and you can actually see.
there 's still react, well, yeah, actually react to, to that need to see that actually close up.
so what we need to do if you guys can just clean through this get rid of any of this, or beard.
we stuck in there.
something just needs just need that pulling out the deafness, including just check that also live sleep.
so we 're just going to boil diesel.
i 've always explore them alive and muscles and i think this side.
i 'm going to start making white wine source which means onion, you 're going to find the dice an instant garlic.
so , if this is so easy and quick why do n't people ever do this at home.
i think people are scared of the month.
they said they might have them when they 're out in a restaurant, but they wo n't bother doing it at home.
and you see how quick this is effectively this is french fast food.
both are onion diced up there that 's going to go into a pan with a little bit of oil and another butter.
you should not.
onions can go in there and i stopped in.
wait , wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait and with that, some garbage.
so why is it might be you 're.
so scared of seafood, and i think a lot of it is to do with people, do n't other texture of certain foods and or cold stone spokeswoman, yeah, i bashed called stand for the text reason.
yeah , and i love salmon with ginger.
darlex very french, is that they wear around their necks and stuff that he did have a lot of employers in france is that the reason.
now they 're just big fan of garlic and so, my, it should go in a lot of especially or white wine stores i 'm not going, i 'm not friends.
but i 'm a big fan of garlic, using that have you ever been to france people i 've got a couple times.
i did take a girl at the eiffel tower once.
yes , she like it how we doing that all about there.
i think they 're beardless, so onion and garlic and pretty much set it off i 'm going to add a squeeze of lemon juice.
i think we 've tapped as many as we can beautiful with a nearly really scaring the pan.
i just need to add white wine.
obviously , the key element in our white wine source somebody goes in more fish you can just bring that up to boil, and then our muscles which tries to kindly prepared or going to go in there, stretches for pants lid, on and that is, more mone.
yeah , pretty much there, to leave it for a couple minutes just to steam and work.
i 've heard the french alright if they need to turn up is, well, i 've got to lose.
i think aside from that we should be about their muscles have opened up now.
you see how the old open up with anna open.
if they 're not open at this stage then i 'm good at all.
we just get rid of them.
did you get food poisoning from which is why people scared?
if there open before you cook them or closed afterwards do n't eat them.
so will take all the muscles out here and then will use the source in the juices are left to make a source and what 's lesson.
here we can add a little bit of cream, too.
i know the tradition is wo n't like that.
but i think a treat so from cream and some fresh parsley there we go.
so we later.
source , source, all the cooking juices over muscles view couche, avec, mosses.
well , alamo lumber, we 've seen issues i can meet somewhere nice shower garnish with parsley there, we have the idol dish that reminds me of holiday.
most it 's more marinir.
no reason to be scared.
