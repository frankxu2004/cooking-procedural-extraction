hello , friends with those effects racial.
i come back to this kitchen today.
i 'm going to show you guys how to make onion samosa, which must be a very, very favorite for everyone so let 's get started.
you go something to begin in a mixing bowl ad hoc, up off all purpose flour, that is my love fuck couple or wheat flour salt to date and just give it to meh and then brazil at least pull off oil into this, and then make this oil with this floor.
so you will get a light crumble texture.
it helps to give your summer self a super, super crispy texture, so, whatever snack you prefer if you want them to be a very crispy, you can follow this method of adding oil into the floor, slightly crumble them, and then you can make a dope.
so now going to add some water and make it into a soft or just like the way we prepare for a lo TR, chapati, and always add water little by little.
otherwise , you might end up with very loose to.
so you should get proper find softap dope like this.
so now need the door for at least two three minutes till they get soft end and then cover it with a damp cotton cloth for at least twenty minutes.
so why did this resting, we will proceed with making stopping for the summer song.
so this, this is the only in.
some , as i 'm going to use a lot of onion for the stuffing.
so in another mixing boat at one audience, which is medium size to finally chopped and here.
i have some galatyn been which i had shop.
then finally so you could also use any of your favorite stuffing like bunny or green peas, or, also, some cauliflower or scrambled egg whatever stuff we you now, you can have even chicken anything and then i 'm adding a finely chopped coriander leaves just one tablespoon and then for spicer, for spiciness.
i 'm adding a teaspoon of gamma style up.
order you can add gramma, celek over depending on how spicy you want, you know, add salt to taste.
so adding thought right remote is very important for the stuffing.
otherwise , the dish may not taste good.
so add right amount of sod, it should not be too much.
but it 's not below.
so just mix all the ingredients until, well, combined can your stuffing is ready.
so now we will proceed worth of making stuff.
so now the door has been rested for around twenty minutes and they are soft enough.
now make up a small a balls, i mean, are not very small bars like a medium sized aboard just the way you prefer for latter tea or chapati and also remember to shave them perfectly like this.
now we have to roll them into a sheet for that just a test some dry flower.
so that it will not require, you know, them and start rolling them into a very, very thin sheet more than euro them more crispy and tasty summer cells you work, it.
so ensure that you are rolling them into one very thin sheet.
so if you feel that it is kind of stinky you ca n't just some more dry plot, anderko them interval very thin sheet i know, you had to slightly heat the some, ocean seat over after work to reduce the marcher or not be cause the battles anymore.
it is really hard to shape them into a perfect promotion states.
so here i have a tower which is already a preheater so your double should be at medium hot and add those rolled sheet into this.
and you do n't need to cook this for long time just cook both side for a five to six seconds.
that 's all not more than that.
once you see the moisture was gone and there is no stickiness immediately.
take it on talk with hour.
so justify seconds or six second on both side and then take it off, you know, your sheets already, and i 'm going to dream of the ages to get a perfect square shape.
so if you have enough practice you can even roll it into a square shape, that way you can avoid a lot of doe ray stage.
so now you can see it looks perfect square.
and i 'm going to cut the sheet into three.
so each, each sheet should have at least three inches worth and eight inches height.
that way you will get a perfect medium sized triangles.
so three inches worth anything just height.
and i have got around to three sheets with one rolled parodia hot chocolaty.
so we had to do the same with the rest of your dough, and if you have any leftover, or if you want to make them in a bank prepare it and at this point of time, you can roll them in aluminium foil sheet and freeze it for one month or.
so and now take another small mixing bowl and into it add two teaspoons of all purpose flour and two tablespoon of water to make it into work based.
but this one, we need to stick the samosas.
so if it 's just ready and.
now take one sheet an applying based on two sides and then take one page and pasted opposite side and take that waste your sight and out pasted to the opposite side, like this, and whenever you 're pasting make sure you 're pasting it without any gap and you will get a small packet at the center like this and put those stuffing inside in.
now just take it and currently, actors and you will get a perfect triangle like this.
so whenever you or basting it there should not be any gap in the joints and also in the corners.
so , if that is any gap, you may also use some more based to a based it properly without any gap becaus, if there is any gap there stopping me come off while you find that.
so i will show you guys one more and first take a sheet and applied based on both sides and then take one end paste it to the other end, like this, do the same once again and then you will get a small packet at the center and every time you 're wasting make sure there is no cap and then put those stuffing inside this packet, then just cover it up like this, and you will get a perfect triangle shape.
so just use some more paste to stick it without any cap.
and that 's all your son was already.
so i had just preferred one lee for some muscles as of now, or the recipe shad you could prefer around attend samosa.
but i just prefer one lee ford.
and if you prefer you may also freeze this stuff to some authors in the freezer for one month and make sure you thaw them properly before deep frying, and otherwise you can refrigerate for two days also to use it later.
so now we 'll see how to deep fry them.
so here i have oil which is already pre heater.
make sure your oil is hot that way you will get very crispy take shelter.
and i 'm going to drop them one by one into this for doyle.
so , as soon as i drop them, you could notice that, that picture of the summer has got.
a beautiful, bubbly texture over it.
and that gives your summer sauce very good happy tising.
look make sure that you are flipping it to the.
next side to ensure that your summer cells are cooking on both side with the perfect code and color, and i always prefer to defray the stamos after i see three corners autismo sauce or dark brown.
