hey , everybody and welcome to the wolfpit hate going to make some barbeque pork fried rice and these are the breastbone, trimmings that did from the saint louis ribs over the weekend and.
so i pulled him out of the freezer and go ahead and just pull all this meat.
often hear an use.
this , since i do n't have any char sue to make the pork fried rice with.
but this is actually probably a pretty good substitution.
OK , we 're ready to go ahead and get our fried rice going.
so we have a hot medium hot walk here.
heat we 're going to add about two tablespoons of oil in here and go ahead and start off scrambling three eggs.
one egg per cup of rice or using three cuts, rights.
that 's just not really scramble.
she 's up i think.
i mentioned it before, but the whole point in scrambled eggs prior to the prime rice is that way.
the eggs do n't clump around, your rice.
make big balls and rice and your, your fried rice.
we 're going to move these from the walk.
all right now, we 're going to go ahead and add a little bit more oil about another tablespoon or two.
not two tablespoons there alright.
once are oils heated up go ahead and add in one large yellow onion.
you do n't use this much onion, but i like a lot of onion in my fried rice.
i know, add in four cloves roughly chopped garlic.
do n't know now we 're going to add in our barbecue port stir fry?
this just to keep the pork back through all right.
now we 're going to add in three cups of cooked rice are napa radnor rice were added about teaspoon.
maybe two teaspoons of sesame E oil more or less, i do n't know how much you like we 're going to add about two tablespoons of soy sauce again.
this is all preference.
there 's no direct recipe for this overhand.
we 're going to add two cups of frozen mixed vegetables, peas, carrots and corn tell me more in green beans.
all right, after the right stir fry for a few minutes we 're going to go ahead.
and that, or eggs back, yet barbecue pork fried, rice is done.
see if we get a little close up here real quick looks almost good enough to eat, does n't it worlds dig into this, with a spoon.
i 'm not going to be himself in with chopsticks in front of you guys trying to eat rice.
so let 's get in here in the middle and.
so we 've got there a little port care peas rice could just try and see how it turns out hum you immediately taste the smokiness from the port in assessment.
well , huh, look at their port looks kind of just like char sue dot net.
get some egg on this one D licious.
sometimes i think i 'm asian.
take one more bite here absolutely perfect, well, and i forgot to mention to the rice.
i used i cook the early this morning just let sit on stove all day.
and you do n't want to cook rice right immediately when you 're ready to make fried rice here.
they wo n't do it day before or little bit in time advance, they have time to dry out and separate a little bit and as you can see this is not sticky at all, not clumpy the eggs are loose in this everything is loose is delicious.
great flavor, well, thank you guys very much for watching and we 'll see you next time.
