well , everybody loves buffalo wings party wings, hot wings there.
so popular now that they are actually more expensive than boneless, skinless chicken breasts and that 's why you see boneless, skinless wings at a lot of places all the bars and restaurants and fast food, places are selling chicken wings.
and they have become one of the most expensive parts of the chicken.
obviously you 've heard me before i 'm going to tell you.
go to costco they 're the cheapest wings interesting.
lee you may find frozen wings in the bag.
uncooked broken down completely ready for you to cook for less expensive than the fresh wings, which is interesting, is usually the more process?
something is the more expensive.
it is in this case.
we found a great deal on the whole uncooked wings and first thing.
you need to do is take these things apart.
so it 's really pretty easy one cut down by the skin.
pop it open.
and you can see the joint and then straight through the joint you 're never ever cutting through bone the wingtip same thing here.
you do sort of have to go right through it.
save those wing tips for soup, they are very, very valuable OK so there.
i got the wings that was about fifteen of them that i cut up sort of laborious in a bit of a pain.
but it 's always better if you do this stuff yourself now, we 're going to season them.
and , here 's the thing we 're not going to deep fry.
these , the way traditional buffalo wings are those are the best.
and there 's no denying.
that 's the way to do 'em.
but if a lot of people do n't have deep fryers, we 're going to try to do these in the oven, the problem with doing them in the oven, is, they do n't get.
well , if you read around the internet and all those other cool places, where they have recipes, they 've come up with a way to keep these things crispy in the oven.
we 're going to test it out and see if it works so.
first , we need to make a seasoning mix and for the seasoning mix, i 'm gonna make.
i 'm going to use a couple of tablespoons of my season salt mix, which again as i 've said before the recipes on the web if you do n't feel like making it yourself will be happy to sell you some couple of tablespoons of the pepper and instead of a lot of other seasonings.
they tell you to put baking powder is baking.
powder they say, crisps up the wings.
i do n't know if it does.
but we 're going to add about two tablespoons to the mix and mixed up thoroughly.
and really, get it into the wings, sort of rub it in all the wings of thoroughly coated with this mixture it looked fantastic.
but there 's one more thing we need to do before we make them.
and this is why i hope you 're not watching this the morning of super bowl sunday, these things have to sit and dry in the refrigerator for a day that 's going to help keep the skin very, very crispy.
we 're going to set him out on a tray put him in the fridge and let him dry overnight.
well , you can see the things have been drawing overnight.
they 've got a nice dry texture of the skin is dried out.
alot , we rubbed him with the seasonings in the baking powder to make him get crispy at least in theory.
and now we 're going to put.
him , in a four hundred degree oven total cooking time is going to be probably about forty five minutes.
but i 'm going to check him after about twenty, twenty five minutes and flip him over the other thing to know, is that i put the oven rack all the way up as high as it will go.
so that i can get a lot of radiated heat from the top of the oven.
so it 's almost more like a broiler will see if that works.
so now into the oven for the first twenty.
well , i 've got these out of the oven now.
and they 're actually turning a rather nice color.
so they get a chance to sort of based themselves with whatever fat they have under the skin that 's rendering out.
these may stick a little bit, just move him a little bit on the rack and they should come off fairly.
easy , well, i will say they look pretty good.
and they 're smelling really, really good.
but now back into the oven for another twenty, twenty five minutes, well spent about twenty five extra minutes.
i gotta, say these things look really, really good.
they 're not tremendously dark in color, but they do have a very firm crispy feeling skin.
so , i think we may have accomplished our goal of getting crispy wings out of the oven.
instead of deep, frying them, i have here the most typical brand of hot sauce that 's used for these wings.
it 's probably the most authentic, and i have a bat in this little cup.
i have about a quarter cup of melted butter to which i 'm going to add about a half a cup of hot sauce.
i 've got a nice big bowl here.
i 'm going to put my sauce into it and i 'm not going to solve, solve the wings 'cause the boys are going to come home.
and they 're not going to want sauce probably but let 's take.
i do n't know it does n't.
and a half horse and just shake him through the sauce you can hear how crispy they are there.
you have it some very crispy, very tasty oven fried buffalo wings.
