hey guys things stop by ballistic barbeque today.
let 's get going.
so the inspiration for creating a cajun burger actually came from a variety of sauces and seasonings that was sent to me by keith jenkins over there at frog bone.
keith is a great guy and he 's become a pretty much a good buddy to all of us.
barbecuers on the you tube.
so anyway, we 're going to start off with patty what i 've done here as i 've taken about a pound of beef short rib, and i 've grounded up with two links the sausage.
so what i did was i slice the unduly up into little pieces.
and i alternated beef and dewey beef and dewey, then i loosely toss it up just to make sure it got nice and incorporated here.
so let 's make some patties.
what i 'm going to do is take from guesstimating to be about a third of a pound.
i 'm just going to form these into fairly loose patties, sindhu smells really, really good.
and i smoke you smell going on all right there we go now.
i want layers of flavor to be in this now.
there 's a lot of flavor going on inside this beef patty.
but what i want to do is season the outside let me wash my hands, and will get to the seasoning alright.
so when i was looking at the pack of seasonings first thing it jumped out at me was the blackened seasoning put out by frog.
bone smells really, really good.
and i think it 's going to be a great compliment to this beef in the end.
so i 'm going to go ahead and give this nice get seasoning on top.
i 'll flip it get to the other side at the grill.
heating up outside, so i will meet you out there.
alright guys, so since i 'm going to be blackening the seasoning on this beef, i 'm going to be using my flat top today, got the cray court cast iron skillet insert in here through a surprise at year.
a little bit later let 's get this patty on.
so you can see beast getting cooked up along the side.
we 're going to give this a flip.
that 's what i want to see that nice kind of blackened seasoning there going to go ahead and throw on slice of sharp cheddar cheese.
can now the oil what i have here are some very thinly sliced onion mixed in with some pickled jalapeno, then i poured in a little bit of that jalapeno juice, kind of could all the onions and everything going to toss it in some seizing this is just some white flour seasoned with frog bones?
all person all purpose seasoning.
well , that 's going we 're going to go ahead and get these buns toasted nice test on the barn.
all right, as you can see beautiful color on those onions and jalapenos get these on some paper towels alright patties done.
let 's put together a cajun burger guys.
all right, the first thing we do is lay down some lettuce.
and i 'm using butter lettuce going to lay down a couple very thinly sliced pieces of tomato, you know, that beautiful season patty very hot.
right now, right now that room a lot, this is room a lot sauce that frog bone puts out and those onions and jalapenos.
now , the bread, just toasted with butter.
i love that it really brings out some great flavor in the hamburger and there.
we , go guys, let 's give it a try.
this is going to be a messy one.
there 's some heat here, but not too much that remoulade sauce is perfect for hamburger, and i knew it would be when i tried it.
so i was really excited about this burger.
you ca n't go wrong with fried onions and jalapenos and again.
that blackened seasoning, yeah, there 's some cajun, going on here, guys, anyway, thanks for stopping by definitely go check out frog bones youtube channel and website.
