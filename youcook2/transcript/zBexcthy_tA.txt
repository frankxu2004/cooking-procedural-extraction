hello , and welcome to crouton, crackerjacks today i 'm going to show you how to make this delicious chick in a parmesan.
this is one of those dishes.
it sounds a lot more complicated than it really is, but it 's really simple these degree sexual need.
so , let 's get started.
i 'm going to start off with two boneless, skinless chicken breasts here.
and these have been to thought an using.
and i 'm just going to trim off the grizzly parts and the excess fat.
maybe some of the skin that 's leftover on there just kind of trim up and clean up a little bit, then i 'm going to cut that breast right in half set those off onto a plate and then trim up and clean up my second chicken breast now.
i 've got a piece of wax paper here.
and i put that on my cutting board, and i made it long enough so i can fold it over on itself.
and i 'm just going to use a small cup here, and i 'm going to pound out my breast halves until there about a half an inch thick or so.
now you can use anything heavy that you want to use if you have a meat mallet you can use that i do n't happen to have one.
so that 's why i 'm using my small bowl.
you can also use the bottom of a skillet or frying pan, you can use a rolling pin really, whatever you have.
it could be that you can tell miss out with and when you get 'em all done it this is what they will look like this should be about a half an inch thick, or so.
maybe a little bit thinner.
and now we can start working on our brighting ingredients.
the first thing i 'm going to eat is an egg wash, so i might take two large eggs and crack those into a bowl.
and if you get any shells in there, be sure to get those out.
do n't want any little crunchy bits in your chicken parmesan and using a fork, i 'm just gonna wish these together in another bowl i 've got about one and a half cups of italian style breadcrumbs, and i 'm going to add in a quarter of a cup of grated parmesan cheese?
now i 'm using my homemade italian bread crumbs here.
i will put a link in the description box that will take you to a video that shows how i make those and then finally in a third bowl.
i 've got about a half a cup of flour.
i 'm going to add in a teaspoon of salt, but a half a teaspoon of ground, black pepper.
i 'm going to fix this together, and now we can start breading are chicken now.
the writing process is really simple on this, you just want to take one of your powdered out pieces of chicken and regit in the flour mixture shake off the excess and then put it into your eggs.
and then you want to let the excess drip off.
and then you want to go right into your bread.
crumbs you want to take your bread crumbs and kind of push him into your chicken there.
and that will make sure that you get a nice thick coating on your chicken.
and when you get that completely coded go ahead and set it off onto a plate.
and then continued reading the rest of your chicken and once all your chicken is breaded, you want to let this sit and let that coding kind of icky.
are to the chick in for about fifteen minutes or so, before you cook them up?
i 've got my small cast iron skillet on medium high heat here.
and i 'm going to put it in about a quarter of an inch, or.
so of extra virgin olive oil into the bottom of that, and, i 'm going to let that come up to temperature, and then i 'm going to start frying up my chicken pieces.
now you do n't want to crowd your pan too much.
here you want to give him a little room to breathe.
and you want to buy these for about two minutes on each side.
now frying these will not cook the chicken completely we 're going to be making these and that will finish cooking them.
so , do n't worry about cooking the chicken all the way through you just want to get the breading?
nice and golden brown and after about two minutes, they should be golden brown on the first side.
go ahead and flip them over and continue cooking for another two minutes, or so on the second side.
and once they are golden brown on the second side you want to remove them off to a plate lined with paper towels, and then you want to repeat this process with the other pieces of chick in now, that all my chicken has been pan fried.
i 'm going to put this into a glass baking dish sing a seven by eleven.
i think baking dish, you can use a nine by thirteen, you just want to put your chicken pieces in there.
make sure that they 're not overlapping at all.
and then you want to label on some marinara sauce onto each one of your chicken parmesan 's.
now this is my homemade marinara sauce.
it is my spaghetti sauce, minus the meat and i have a video that shows how i make that i will again put the link in the description box.
so you can see how i make that you could also use jcard spaghetti sauce that is perfectly fine.
you just want to put, maybe about quarter of a cup.
half a cup, or.
so of marinara sauce on each chicken parmesan.
next i 'm going to take some shredded mozzarella cheese and put a handful or.
so on top of each chicken parmesan, and you can leave it with just the mozzarella on it, and it would still be perfectly.
delicious , however, i 'm going to take it up A notch and when they are done at this is what they will look like now, you could serve these exactly as they are.
however , i like to serve mine over pasta.
so while these were in the oven, i made up a pot of spaghetti, you could also use these and make chicken parmesan sandwiches which would be absolutely amazing.
but since i did decide to serve this on spaghetti when it and put some spaghetti onto a plate there pick out one of the chicken parma johns and put it right on top.
you could add more softer this.
if you would like, and there you go how to make chicken parmesan at home from scratch.
