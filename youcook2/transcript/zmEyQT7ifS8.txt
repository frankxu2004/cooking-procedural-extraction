it 's on the bad news of most of the restaurants in the world, and it 's a popular lunchtime classic what would you say, if i told you we were going to do the ultimate version of a chicken caesar, salad attack ca n't wait and it 's not going to do good.
we 're going to make it ultimate by poaching are chick in.
we 're going to make a homemade caesar dressing.
we can do all of these things are going to tomatoes on the vine croutons season, with five different flavorings.
and i think the best part a parmesan cheese basket, this does n't sound like your ordinary chicken caesar, salad, and it starts with our chicken.
so one chicken breast.
and we 're going to put that into a pan of boiling water, but as soon as it goes in turn, the heat off why.
and then let it post about ten minutes.
be cause, then it 'll be slightly less than boiling, which keeps it really moist and succulent and just cooking attempt to get soda sally cooler, cooler by cook chicken through later on we 'll take it out, slice it and child rape case.
if you can do that over here.
i have got a chunk of parmesan, and i think this is the best part.
this is now parmesan boston, or do is great it.
nice and find great into a large disk.
and then just going to tidy up the ages for those bits will burn otherwise.
so it 's going to be a ball.
how do we get the bowl shaped that becomes later on?
so this is going to another hundred eighty degrees.
celsius for four minutes till its molten kind of bubbling and lil bit golden and as it comes out and get straight overbold upside down.
so there is an inverted bowl, and as it cools, it undergoes britain.
turn out OK, so they can go into the next up our croutons.
we 've got one ship at a loaf, and jamie.
if you can slice that into pieces, she better kind of croutons rather than square ones and to it i 'm going to add five different flavors.
salt pepper dried thyme, dried oregano and garlic powder, and mix all of those together.
sketch them over i feel better with good reason, well, and they can go into the other alongside, pompoms actress at this stage you have got, to be careful.
you also gotta be pretty quick.
this is really, really hard.
molten cheese so just lifted over bowl and give it about ten fifteen seconds.
and then hopefully we can take it off and turn it over.
we have our very own bowl to serve our caesar salad in that, that is, what makes this thing answer without dealt with a salad, we, of course need addressing.
now you can buy that.
but that 's not very old smith.
this is open to making your own going to use two different types of oil.
the egg and then flavor it with an chicken parmesan and wish your source wow, just start without.
we need just an egg, yolk to basically make a mayonnaise.
so separate out an egg.
you 're going to get all the whiskey.
it goes in their machines ultimate with skiing machine.
you are at the old whiskey machine.
so if we add a dash of white wine vinegar pinch of salt and pepper some vegetable oil and then also later on we 're going to do rapeseed oil about half beach.
so it 's not to golden.
will pay off dressing for this?
that 's already before as you travel in the oil really, really slowly, what happened, is the oil and the egg helps his kind of emulsify it.
and you get a thickening.
i love it.
when you talk all sciences figures of science, but it 's also a loved its ultimate.
but if you are looking for other healthy salads on the feel good food series we 've done once.
i have watermelon salad.
the tunas, soi, there was a lobster tail salad is amazing.
it was all just incredible.
you 're looking for healthy, i had that direction as soon as you 're happy.
you 've got consistency of mayonnaise.
it 's now time to season it pepper and vinegar.
but now wish your source a good splash off, yeah, for saltiness and cream, and S some grated parmesan.
and that is too thick to be a caesar dressing.
so a splash of warm water as you whisk, and that 's kind of thing you find the bottle from supermarket.
except this one jamie is ultimately next up our salad, and we 're going to take a little gem lettuce.
if you can just pluck the leaves, you want to keep in pretty much whole 'cause they 're beautiful.
it leaves if you can also take some of this cherry tomatoes and just put them off the vine binary to most of the volume do.
so because they have so much better flavor while you 're doing that, i 'm going to slice up a red onion keeping the peace is mostly fine.
you do n't onion to overpower the rest.
the flavor specials were keeping it raw and now to chahrour chick in so hopefully poached perfectly.
look at that in the middle of their cooked away through.
but never overcook does n't draw out there 's nothing worse when you buy a salad.
in short order grill for twenty minutes on the outside is.
so dry in order to cook at midway through that is, what 's going to happen here is good to go i can feel that heat from here.
and it, it 's already cooked.
so this is purely for decoration and for a very extra flavor.
because it 's ultimately and.
now to dress a salad.
so it looks as good.
it 's going to taste the palm is embossed on the base and plenty of our little gem lettuce on top dress that with our caesar dressing and then jamie with cherry tomatoes will actually remember, lydia is just done a video or dating divers where she said that chicken caesar, salad was the ultimate first date mill, and was that when she said it was.
because it was light it 's not messy.
it 's hey scared.
and you look good whilst.
you 're eating it rips, will always be better?
food comes first, and he does n't.
always , always why would you change yourself for somebody else.
if it 's this ultimate caesar salad, i changed.
maybe that 's different more, dressing more layers of tomato.
we put onion on there as well, now i 'm going to grab the chick in.
so , we get plenty of that on top of their, every stage of the process is better than anything you would get anywhere else.
these are fresh straight out the deli counter already marinated, but fresh anchovies.
we 've got a little bit in our dressing already, but a couple of those on top dressing grab just two croutons.
jamie plenty of seizing in spite of those five different things, but that is, i think the ultimate chicken caesar salad jamie, will have to do just checkin?
OK , it looks fresh and vibrant not going to take the healthiest anywhere without cheese basket.
but wow, is really worth the extra effort that every single pieces had their that takes incredible as we said at the start, caesar, salad you can pretty much get, everywhere and yet this one hopefully gets put down in front someone with parmesan basket, you get the well factors well mapped, well, this one 's ultimate.
