i have some shredded cabbage in this one.
i have some shredded carrots you can use any vegetables of your choice, you can use bean sprouts, beans, cauliflower, whatever you would like in your spring rolls.
and then i 'm also going to use onions.
some ginger and garlic now.
these are frozen ones, so they kind of look weird, but we 're going to try them.
then we are going to use a pastry rap here, and you can see that i had actually put them on a plate which is covered with a wet towel, and they 're going to fill our stuffing in this.
so really easy to make their going to fry are onions along with ginger garlic, paste and in this.
we are going to add.
salt bridge chili powder garam, masala.
if you want a little indian flavor, and some soy sauce give them a quick starsoft on them a little bit look at that.
so , so, all casper taste i 'm going to go ahead and add two teaspoons here, and red chili powder.
you can also add green chilies if you like starting guard onions.
ginger garlic, salt regiment, otter, and then this will go ahead and add are soy sauce.
so two tablespoons of soy sauce so, i saw simran onion to become a little soft.
will go ahead and add are veggie tables next now, you do n't have to buy them a lot?
just sorted them likely.
because if you pry them a lot, they might start leaving from water, which we do n't beyond.
so just going to start it down little bit here.
so our stuffing is ready.
will set it aside, and here i have two tablespoons of all purpose flour that 's mother ann?
i 'm just going to add few drops of water to make a fine paste.
so just makes it well, to have a smooth paste, it.
and we 're going to use this as a glue to close our spring.
rolls you just mix them together and set them aside.
so we 're using this spring roll pastry you can find it at any asian grocery store, and what, what i have done this was frozen.
i have caught it.
and you do n't want it to dry out so i had kept it in a wet cloth.
so in our pastry here we 're going to put our stuffing and you want to make it that it 's nice and tight, and we 're going to roll it out.
so take one corner and put it in, and slowly roll this.
go right in the middle and stop.
now turn the corners and.
continue , the process when you reach the very end.
what you need to do is that all purpose flour that we made just take a little bit put it at the end and close this.
so make all your rules like this, look at that beautiful hey and what i 'm going to do.

fry them you can pan fry them if you want, but it 's spring rolls so you got to deep fry them so hot all in they walk.
and we just added are spring rolls, and we going to fry them until they are brown on both sides, look at that beautiful golden on all sides.
exactly , the way we wanted so now will go head, and serve it hot and crispy look at that, so our spring roll is ready to be enjoyed.
