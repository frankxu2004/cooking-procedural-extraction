today will be making pure augie.
let 's make our pirogue dough here.
i have my flower.
i 'm going to add salt stir it in.
i 'm going to take my eggs and add them to my water.
this helps to get the eggs evenly distributed in the girl gradually add the egg mixture while stirring with a fork.
i just keep tossing to incorporate the ingredients.
makes it a little easier.
when you go to need it, i 'm going to start to bring this dough together with my hands.
and as i do so be able to tell if it 's going to be too dry or too moist.
if it feels too dry to me, this is the time to add a little extra water and if it feels too moist if he had time to add a little more flour feels pretty good after i have all the ingredients in corporate, then, i 'm going to put it on the table and need darkness on the table.
now i 'm going to need this for about a minute as i 'm needing it.
i 'll pick up the bits of flour and oat that are on the table.
we do n't need to overnight this dough just need to make sure that it 's nice and smooth and even usually a minute does it.
i just kind of pushing the door back and forth and put in my body weight, behind it helps to bring it all together.
so it feels pretty smooth.
i 'm pretty even i do n't feel any lumps in there, but now it needs to sit and rest before we roll it out.
so i 'm just going to cover this with a little flower.
put a piece of plastic over it and let it sit for about fifteen minutes, and then i 'll be ready to use our dough is ready to go.
we 've rested it and i 'm going to take about half of it.
the other half of the side.
keep it covered, so it does n't dry out.
but the little flower on my table press, the dough out with my fingertips give it a head start.
i keep flowering it to make sure that it 's not going to be sticking to my table flower, the top we can brush off the excess flour later on.
now i 'm going to roll it future role from the center out and keep checking that it 's not sticking to the counter keep putting a little flower underneath it.
OK , it 's nice and even is fairly thin about maybe an eighth of an inch or so i 'm going to take my putter service.
i 'll take my scraps of dough, which can be reused switch them together, and i 'm just going to put them on the backside of the dough that we have saved from before will begin with our potato cheese and are feeling is nice and cold that is pretty firmed up.
i 'm using a three quarter ounce, disher and i 'm going to put one scoop on each now.
we 're going to shape these i take one basically.
i 'm going to stretch the filling over the dough.
so i 'm going to push down the filling, push the dough up and over and then seal it at the top first.
and then i 'm going to see it at the sides, and i just pinch all along now that i 've got it pretty sealed.
i 'm going to make sure that it 's very good in sealed.
and i 'm going to squeeze really hard on this edge.
we just repeat that process again.
take the puro game.
one hand sort of pushed down and pull up the dough around the filling squeeze at the top making sure that i do n't have any filling in there, and then pinching.
these are ready to be boiled.
make sure you have a large pot with a lot of water.
because if the pirogi are too crowded and the water takes too long to come back to a boil they 're not going to come out is good.
so just drop your peruvian one by one.
you give it a stir once with a wooden spoon to make sure that they 're not sticking to the bottom and then it takes about three minutes for them to be done the purity.
when they 're just about done, should be offloading to the surface as they are in the water should be vigorously boiling?
so will remove these now.
i have over here.
a trade that i just put some oil on going to scoop these up and put them on the tray.
let them get coated with a thin coating of oil, which will help prevent members sticking.
even though these true, we are ready to be, you know, you could eat them, just like they are you could put some butter on them.
but we 're going to fry them up going to serve them with some sauteed onions and sour cream.
pink are butter is ready.
so when it yet are paying on cheese girl games in or sauerkraut and mushroom, i 'm loose from the bottom of pan, put this over somewhat medium gauge keep a close eye on them 'cause you do n't want to do firm.
OK , those are ground on one side, the side a little bit, and i 'm going to add some onions buy onions around a little bit too.
he 's not even working this air pergola just about a dog, are purely already now?
we just played them out.
arrange them around some sour cream that i have on his play with a little parsley on top.
no three potato and cheese and, through sauerkraut and mushroom, and i will take some of these onions that we may and they are ready to be served.
i hope you enjoy this video watching.
