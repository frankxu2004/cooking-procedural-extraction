welcome back to true treats this week.
we 're making wiener, schnitzel and noodle, wiener, schnitzel is best described as crispy thin meat.
so the first thing you 're going to need to do is pound out your protein.
we placed our pork chops in between a piece of saran wrap.
we do this.
because it protects the outside of the meat from getting mashed ambushed up when you 're pounding it flat after your done tenderizing and pounding out the meat you could take some salt and pepper and be sure to spread it evenly on both sides then it 's time to set up your batter station for four.
pork chops one angle work perfect in our battery station.
so you correct that into a pan and quickly whisk it up then, we 're going to put a flower on one plate.
and , our bread crumbs on the other, which we just use from old bread that we toasted, and ride ourselves then, we take the pork chop basket in the flower.
dunk it in the egg and make sure you get the bread crumbs spread evenly on both sides when your battery in your pork chops.
it 's going to get a little messy, so dive, right in with those fingers wiener, schnitzel is made with four common proteins on the lean side.
you 've got turkey and chicken and on the other side, you have pork and veal.
if you 're staying traditional, then you better be using veal.
because wiener, schnitzel is one of the national distance of austria, where, by law, if you 're using, that name, it must be made with veal.
now there is some debate over when wiener, schnitzel was originally created ranging from between the fifteenth and the seventeenth century.
but we do know earliest recorded record of the use of the word wiener, schnitzel was in forty five in go the pork chops into our nice hot oil, be sure to give the panis shake that you spread the oil evenly over the pork chops and avoid them from sticking to the bottom about three and a half minutes in.
and we give him a quick flip for another three and a half minutes as we make a fast salad and grab a wedge of lemon for tradition and then it 's time to eat time for canoodle.
the first thing we need to do is pilar potatoes and be sure to cut out any dark spots.
you might find there about the color of the small bruise toss.
the potatoes and some boiling water and boil them up until they 're about fork tender, then remove it from the water and allow them to cool before shredding once the potatoes are cool.
it 's time to prepare ardo grab, a potato anna greater or a rice press.
if you have one and grade up those potatoes into nice thin strips, once you do that you 're going to create a hole in the centre, or you 're going to add your flower and the egg, the whole is a nice way to keep the egg from running.
while you 're preparing your dough, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha take a spatula and start to mix the potato flour and egg want to continue to use the spatula to mix it until it begins to bind and clump together once you do that.
add your salt and then grab it with your hands and start working it together just like a loaf of bread need the dough back and forth until it continues to bind and turns into one solid ball canoodle.
are potato dumplings that can also be made with old bread there, often served as a side dish to meet?
but they can also be stuck with pumps for a yummy dessert or served inside a soup.
there are known around the world, for many different names, for instance.
in czech republic there called and hungry, there called in italy there called luxembourg.
they 're called in the united states there called overall.
i call them delicious once your dough has binded and balled up.
it 's time to make the individual dumplings grab off a small chunk of the dough and roll it back and forth in between your hands as we just showed each one of our dumplings was about an inch to an inch and a half in diameter.
ha , ha, ha, ha, ha, once you finish making your dumplings it 's time to throw them back in some boiling water, will start to float after about five to ten minutes?
and that mean, third just about done once the dumplings are all done grab a slotted spoon and be sure to drain the water from each one.
place them onto a plate and today, we seasoned ours with some crushed black pepper and a little bit of basil ha.
