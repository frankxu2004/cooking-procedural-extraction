along with the corn, beef tried making the recipe for cole cannon.
let 's dish host.
chris ketki shows us how to make a traditional irish side dish cole.
cannon is an irish side dish that 's inexpensive to prepare because it brings together cabbage and potatoes to start it off.
we cut up the cabbage by cutting through the core of the cabbage in half and then cut it into quarters like.
so all we have to do is remove the tough core and then dice up the cabbage, make a couple of cuts, turn it ninety degrees, and then a couple more cuts, and it 's ready to cook, we 're going to take the cabbage and put it into a pot along with some diced up peeled russet potatoes, cover it with water.
bring it up to a boil and cook it until are nice and tender when the potatoes and cabbage are done.
and then in the same pot melt some butter toss in some diced onions when the onions are good and software going to put some warm milk into the pot along with some green onions and then in goes that cabbage and potatoes that we cooked earlier and all we have to do at this point is just like you 're making mashed potatoes were going to smash this up and that cabbage and potatoes will soften into a puree at that point colcannon is ready to serve with your favorite meat or poultry ooh, that looks good to you can look for that recipe.
