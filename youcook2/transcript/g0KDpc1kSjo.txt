closest to maine and then working very carefully and very tightly, just roll over the spring roll pastry just like that and turn it again.
all the while keeping it nice and tight and then when you get to the middle what i want to do is stop and then i want you to fold in the sides of the pastry and then just tuck it in and again nice and tight keep rolling and then stop i 'm just getting a little bit of water on your hands just debit down on the end of that pastry and again working tightly dis roll over and there you are.
