hello , everyone and welcome today, i 'm going to show you how to make korean barbecue, or what 's called colby and we 're going to start off with is the marinade that 's where all the flavor is going to come from.
and that 's what 's going to tenderize.
are meat, so what we 're going to need for the marinade is pineapple, and i 've got some pineapple chunks here and syrup this is about half a cup?
i 've got about a quarter cup of soy sauce about a quarter cup of sugar.
i 've got two teaspoons.
john pepper, i 've got some sesame E oil about two tablespoons, and i 've got about two tablespoons of rice wine vinegar.
i 've got some fresh garlic that we 're going to crush into the marinade, and i 've got some onion.
what we actually need to do with the onion is, we 're actually going to grade it just like if we were grating cheese, and that helps infuse the flavor into the marinade and into the meaning.
so that should be enough onion for us.
so what we 're going to start with the pineapple we 're going to put the soy sauce in there going to put our sugar.
give it that nice sweet flavor that korean barbecue has nice pepper sesame E oil rice wine vinegar to give it a nice little punch.
we 're going to crush some garlic in there.
we do n't want chunks of garlic just like the end, you know, we want it fine, so that we can just infuse it.
we 're going to put three or four cloves of garlic in, here.
it 's a nice car, smells good and we do n't want to forget our onion, onion juice.
nice grated onion already smells good.
OK , we 're going to blend all this together just real quick.
really were just mixing up and kind of crushing their government.
all right, that 's good, we 're going to let our marinates it for a minute we 're going to try to tenderize.
this beef a little bit now.
the beef that we use is the short rib, and it 's cut against the bone.
so short ribs a little bit tough and that 's why we 're going to tenderize it.
we 're going to marinate it overnight, spoke a little bit.
just so that marinade kid see pin to the meat easier that marinade 's going to be enough for between one to two pounds.
so , if you 're making more you need to double or increase the marinade accordingly i 've got about a pound right there.
maybe a pound and a half i will do one more very nice.
we 're going to take a gallon plastic bag and go ahead and put our meetings in there.
and we 're going to get our marinade very nice, perfect.
we 're going to pour a marinade over our meat you 're going to get all the air out.
i will put that in the refrigerator.
let it sit overnight every once in awhile.
will flip it around to make sure all the week it 's evenly marinated and then we 'll be ready for the grill and will grill it.
soon , as the meats ready, i 'll show you how to grill it.
so yesterday we prepare the marinade for our korean beef barbecue, ribs called color, be also and today they 're ready to hit the grill.
so we 're going to take him out.
getting ready for the grill.
they smell great and we have n't even cooked him.
yet any so we 're going to take these out, we 're going to put him on the grill and give them a little taste and see how they came out.
so we 've got our fire on medium.
we 're gonna put on roots out on the fire, oh, good.
and we 're going to close them.
i 'm gonna charge for little bit and come back and check on him in about five minutes.
OK , we 're going to take a look at power.
roots are coming out.
we 're definitely cooking in eternal, got some nice charmer.
gonna move him over to spot.
it 's not quite a time weather two three minutes, and i 'll be ready.
OK , we 're going to check our ribs.
now they should be ready and i use different tongues to take a nap.
then what i did tossing and turning them from the beginning do n't want to overcook them or undercooking.
i think those are probably ready salutes.
let 's take him inside for a taste OK.
now we 've got our ribs inside.
we let him rest for about five to ten minutes so that all the juice does n't just pour out when we cut it.
the meat reabsorbs the juice smell so good.
you can smell the soy sauce.
the pineapple garlic, everything that we put in there.
let 's give it a real tests, give it a little taste.
oh , it 's so tender, oh, perfect i hope you try this recipe, you 'll enjoy it and thanks for watching.
