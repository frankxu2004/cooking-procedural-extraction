hi , there, what 's going on.
it 's lisa here for all food for kids.
hope you have an awesome day so far.
i am going to make one my favorite, favorite soup so it just came back from whole foods, and they were lining up the pumpkins.
and it got me thinking halloween little cooler temperatures, it got me in the mood for a little bit of warm soup, and normally when you eat high raw, you tend to have a lot of cold stuff and when it starts to get a little cooler out.
now it 's understandable that you want to maybe have something that 's a little more warm and comforting, if you 're coming in from the cold.
so last year became a big fan of meso soup, and i 've always loved me.
so soup and it 's very, very good for you.
and it 's totally raw, raw vegan, as well.
and it 's so easy to make this has to be probably the cheapest.
if you 're on a budget.
the least expensive so you could possibly make and it 's absolutely delicious.
and it is just the easiest thing you can make so.
let me show you doing so what you want to do is you want to start off with.
we 're going to use water.
obviously meso paste, which pickup in your health food store you want the sweet white miso paste.
organic sweet, white miso paste.
stab akashiya eight nine bucks it last in the fridge for a very, very, very long time use for salad dressings.
and use it for.
just , you know, it 's kind of a fermented salty flavor.
so , i think i used it in the caesar salad, dressing.
it 's really good stuff it will last a long time and you do n't.
need that much of it.
i 'm going to put in some green onions that i 've got the four cups of water here.
the ratio is one tablespoon of misso paste to one cup of water.
and then i 've got the tops of two green onions.
just the green part sliced really thin and then i 've got four mushrooms.
so one mushroom per cup of water and look how much mushroom for yields when you slice it like paper thin.
OK , so take your time with it.
if you 're not comfortable then i 've just slices thin as you can alright.
so that 's it three ingredients.
really , if four if you want to count the water alright.
so i have a cat, or you could do it on the stove in the pot just heat up some water.
what i did was i.
he did the water.
it was a little too hot, i put it at three cups so i could test it, and then, i added some ice cubes to make it temperature.
you want you basically, you know, i hear one fifteen one eighteen is, is kind of you do n't want to go past that before you start to actually cook stuff?
i like to be on the safe for, and i do n't know if one eighteen is fine, but one nineteen is not fine.
i do n't want to cut it that close.
so i just stick my finger in it, i mean, if i can hold my finger and if it 's something i 'd the water, i take a bath in or put my kids in.
it 's OK, if i could take my spoon.
an zam burning me were OK.
I , I had a thermometer, but i guess i need a new battery.
it 's a good thing i pulled it out.
it gets to get them auburn and see what the temperature is.
but alright so i 've got four cups of water in here and see that i 'm going to add four tablespoons of miso.
paste soup is so good love.
it more tablespoons me so peace.
i 'm doing the blender just to mix up this me so really, well.
you could do it by hand or in a whisk or something.
but usrah, footies here we love our blender.
so why not just, just mix up, you know, just make it nice and smooth.
well , it 's got a real creamy kind of vector, so now i just got a blender on super low.
i 'm just going to store in the green onion and mushrooms and the hot water.
mushrooms will kind of suck that up it 's only it 's not going to shop is going to stir.
it , it OK folks thirty seconds later, we got beautiful meso soup.
check it out asian bowl, so some little asian soup spoons give the taste.
the only thing missing here normally traditionally is a little pieces of tofu.
she wo n't miss that so good manly want me so soup beautiful lunch in the winter time.
you could eat this everyday with a nice pretty salad nice beautiful salad, and you 'll be good to go.
so check this out misso soup.
all right, so it 's getting low cool where you 're at just get these three ingredients.
so easy, and you can enjoy yourself.
