i 'm chef eric crowley, owner of the colon, every classroom in west los angeles and today, i 'm going to show you how to make eggs benedict for our eggs.
we 're going to need hollandaise sauce video of which you can find elsewhere on mahal O dot com.
we 're also going to need a little bit of ham or some kind of pork product.
here i 'd like some pro sciuto.
we warm it basically in a little skillet for a minute or two, or you can warm it in the microwave oven.
we are going to need some toasted english muffins, or any other kind of bread will wind up doing really well, english muffins are classic and by the way for this ham, canadian bacon is the classic type of ham to go on there.
but any kind of him will do just fine poached eggs.
and you can see that video elsewhere on mahala dot com as well, these eggs have been poached.
they 've been shocked in ice water, and they 've been drained.
we need to rewarm these and we wind up taking our room temperature eggs and slide him into some warm water and can be used that you could use the same water that you use to make your hollandaise sauce with basically put it into a little bit of warm water.
let him sit in there for about thirty maybe forty five seconds.
that 's all we 're looking for.
we do n't want to cook the eggs anymore.
we just want to take the chill off and warm up slightly come out of the water.
get him under some paper towels you want to dry off the eggs or else when you want to put in the hollandaise sauce on top.
it 's going to dilute the sauce, and it 's going to make it run all over so some paper towel NG blot, it dry.
they 're going to lift the egg out, lips get your warmed up bacon or in this case, some pro sciuto, on your english muffin at your egg on top of there, and then we 're going to finish it off with our hollandaise sauce right over the top.
but for all over can even get it down onto the plate and that is how you make a classic dish eggs benedict, thanks again for watching be sure to subscribe so, you can get some additional information if there 's a recipe that you would like to see me make feel free to send an email to requests at ma hollow dot com thanks again, and i 'll see you soon.
