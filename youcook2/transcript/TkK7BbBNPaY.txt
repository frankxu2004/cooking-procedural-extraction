shepherds pie, if we 're really honest with ourselves, it 's one of the nation 's favorite dishes.
it is very simple.
garlic onions fried off lammons was to source little flower water.
the secret ingredient as always is in or beef stock pot.
the loyal chopped onion again garlic.
it 's obviously as always cook your onions to remove the water content to move the acidity to allow the natural sweetness a little color libby shepherds pie lamb beef stock pot, it works fantastically well.
and if you 're making a college pi exactly the same method exact the same recipe.
no difference at the lamb and then break it up and mix it in, with the onion as you can see the water content of alanis sign to release, you have to do is continue to cook.
so that water evaporates by doing that.
it intensifies the flavor of the lamb again.
and once the waters evaporated then we can singe the lamb and then proceed in stage.
that was the source etc my lungs now being cooking with the onions in the garlic for approx ten minutes, hair is cracking now.
that 's because the water is almost gone once.
then i can start to singe my meat that little bit of fat content, which is still in the lamp will.
now render caramelize, and that 's how i 'm building my flavor lots of people do n't go to this extreme not.
because they 're lazy.
they just do n't know if you 've got the time and spend the extra ten fifteen minutes of apparating the water and working your lamp.
so there 's no big lumps in there, how many times you have a shepherds pie with big balls of list, all glued together.
that 's because our new work properly it has n't been cooked properly.
we just had a little bit of flower just for body and texture.
about ten grams for half kilo was the source again to taste.
it 's about period, beef stock pot, and then water approx half liter.
so as you can see we 're building all the layers of flavor that are required for a great shepherds pie and the little sprig of thyme now.
we cook that slowly for about an hour when you 're making something like shepherds pie.
there 's no real recipe.
it 's more method then recipe, so you allow your palate dictate.
if you do n't like what 's the source to leave it out.
you do n't like smart appealing.
leave it out in my opinion.
most people make their shepherds apply to dry.
i like my shepherds, pie quite wet, but still with texture so it 's put onto my plate.
but it still holds together rather than it being a solid block.
but again, every parent.
so a ship supply mix is.
now being brazing, surly on top of the stove for one hour as you can see.
there 's a nice richness and also start to dry is not too wet.
so what we do now is which is spoon, this into our dish so then sprinkle my carrots and my die suite.
which is being cooked already.
some people sprinkle peas with that shepherds pie.
i prefer to root veg who peas on the side.
so now and allow this to chill, and to set which will enable me to put my potato on top.
so as you can see the shows pies.
now set i have one kilo mashed potatoes.
it 's very simply spread.
there 's nothing worse.
a friend once told me when you run out of mashed potato, so there 's our basic as you can see.
i 've spread the mash over my pie dish evenly.
i created a nice seal for presentation.
tip your life into the water.
so just rides across the mesh popping.
eleven , which is very hot, put out twenty to thirty minutes.
so there we have it are shepherds pie.
it is in the oven beauty, moist inside not too wet, not too dry.
and then we have this nice crispy topping quite fluffy underneath.
