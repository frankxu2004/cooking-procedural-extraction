hello , everybody greg george here, and i 'm coming today via video.
because i want to show you how easy it is to roll your own sushi at home and today.
i 'm going to show you how to make spicy tuna roll, which is by the way, math favorite sushi on earth anyway.
with spicy tuna roll or any kind of sushi.
if the key will be to have the right ingredients and the first ingredient to make good sushi is it gotta, have the, the right rights.
gotta have sushi rice.
you can find that particular kind of rice at asian markets of upscale grocery store chains, so you gotta.
have the right, right OK, and then to make it all happen, you 're going to have a rash?
so you can have this type of rap.
i also use soy wraps to make, let me just show you a quick video of a soil rap there for maybe more health conscious people.
but anyway, you have to have the rap, and then the ingredients in the ingredients are very simple for spicy tuna, roll fresh to number one.
you gotta, have fresh tuna, then you take that to knit you chop it up into slices, which i 've already chopped up the tuner for this video.
but you chop it up, and a nice smaller chunks.
and then, you mix it, you take japanese man is not your mayonnaise in your refrigerator, japanese mayonnaise and suraci.
you take these two ingredients you put them in the chunks of tuna, and then you throw some scallions up, in, here makes the content for the spicy tuna roll.
so basically i mixed those scallions, and you can pan on down here if you like keep firing those in there to where i got a good mixture ratio of again tuna japanese mayonnaise and sarrah , cha.
and then the scallions.
and then, simply all, i do is i take that, that content.
i get my rap OK and make sure that the dole side is down.
i come over and get that rice.
i was telling you about that by the way, i put japanese vinegar in to make it taste just right, and you can find that also the asian market or the upscale grocery store chain, i 've got my rice all tiny in that rap.
i simply generally grab it with my hands.
i take my content and i evenly place it into rap.
then i throw in a little louder cucumbers there, then it all straight and basically i just started working.
and i try to tighten up that rap.
just tight it up and try to start getting it even to where i know it 'll cut.
just right now this work.
you , gotta work it.
there 's all kinds of apparatus you seen these bamboo rollers and things like that.
i 've been doing this for.
so long that basically i just worked with my bare hands and then you 've got that role, then you get a knife in those sharp makes.
nice cuts on it, OK, it 's a little spicy.
tuna roll is a little more.
i do n't know juicier than the california roll.
and it moves around.
so be careful with that facebook out, got some nice little rolls here.
and then you 're paying in this is that range product.
here i 've gotta lined up with some california roll.
i made earlier, but the bottom line is sushi is very easy to make in your own home.
it 's very inexpensive and it taste very good.
