what are you hungry for eddie carbonaro, beef stroganoff, schnitzel pork chops milanesi rack of lamb?
i like grill, yeah, magashi, quattro, formaggio steaks on the mistake, a turkish sultan boca.
other amana man i 'm getting hungry.
let 's get something to eat.
hey everyone i 'm father leo patalinghug and welcome to grace before meals dot com we are in the home of la signora, genetti, who is welcome just a few of her friends about eighty five people to comment to celebrate the closing of the most holy trinity apostle.
it and to celebrate all that we 're going to make penny ala vodka.
and we 're going to burn all of the alcohol out of the vodka.
this should be a lot of fun and let me ask everyone in the crowd here.
did you all enjoy today 's events?
there is not any five in this throughout the whole house watching it through the TV.
that 's why i have this thing on right now.
i look like i do n't know do n't, do n't tell anybody, what i look like as soon as is olive, oil gets heated up.
we 're going to hit it with the most basic of ingredients garlic olive oil and then i 'm going to actually put the parsley in as well.
because i like to get this nuttiness of the burn.
so month, senior naughty, you do n't mind helping me out my senior nulty is a great cook a great chef diocese of the archdiocese of new orleans and.
let 's see, is it hot enough will see?
AH , it is definitely hot enough you feel that little sizzle and as soon as we do this, it makes you your home smell like an italian home.
because you need a little bit of a garlic and.
now we 're going to add the onions were just going to karma, lies this up a little bit.
actually , a little bit of a saute and while we do this, i want to just ask monsieur nulty what he likes to cook.
because he 's great, what do you like to cook?
well , being from new orleans like everything the cooker local ingredients.
so local ingredients, really happy to have such great fish down in the gulf of mexico is tuna fish and last week.
but helps a nice.
do we before that?
i caught some nice redfish in those on the grill, and we call it on the half, shell.
we need the scales on one side and put it on the grill.
close the grill, and it puts it down it 's like an oyster.
oh , my gosh.
so we 've got this all sauteing up just nicely.
i 'm going to add now a little bit of tomato paste to help kind of thicken the sauce.
naturally , i 'm going to add a little bit of salt and pepper to this, and then we 're going to add the fun with the vodka.
this is a red hot chili peppers.
here just taste so good.
and it adds a nice little heat to it.
as , well, so we 've got all of these things kind of working together.
and you can see that it 's kind of turning into a little bit of a mash next we 're going to deglaze the pan.
and we 're going to like this bad boy on fire.
now when you 're cooking with alcohol, you, gotta make sure that you pay close attention and do n't get too close to it.
because something will happen.
we are working with a electric stove tonight, just a little bit of.
i hear you know what i mean, just a little bit OK, and here we go and we burn the alka hell out of it.
so and basically we 're just going to let this keep going.
and you can see i even have it in the tomato paste because it kinda adds a concentrated sweetness at caramelization and it 's just a lot of fun.
it just adds, these dimensions of flavor that you just kind of ca n't be right now.
so make sure that when you 're doing this that you kind of be very careful.
you have enough clearance and you stay away from the hairspray alright that 's kind of important.
but this will just cook out very quickly no need to worry an if you freak out a little bit just take a lid and put it on top letting a little bit burn off from the side.
so real , simple.
once that 's kind of all cooked out.
now we 're going to add the crushed tomatoes and slightly impatient, ah and all gothic nothing to be scared of this is going to just continue to, to melt its way together.
we celebrated the recognized.
the theme of hope at the holy trinity apostle, it this thing has been going on for how long is this been going on for how many twelve years and today.
we had a wonderful set of speakers on senior nolte was there to talk a little bit about the role of the eucharist and the blessid mother.
we had sister mother, mother dolores and mother know, well, and then brother elijah.
all offering, just wonderful thoughts, now a lot of times people think that italian sauces need to take a long time to cook, and that 's true.
some of them really do some of them do n't take long at all, including this one, there is one thing that we learned at the holy trinity.
posola tonight was that there are some things that need to be penetrating in us and just marinade.
and that 's obviously the presence of god in our lives.
and so what we 're doing is we 're celebrating the whole grace before meals theme by bringing everyone together.
and let me tell you, i think this is going to bring people together.
all right, so we 're adding a little bit of whipping cream to this, and then we 're going to add the POS.
i 'm going to give this a little, little bit of salt yet a little bit of salt and after we can just take some of that pasta.
now i cook the pasta in advance as well, as all the portions for eighty five people, so we 're going to place it in there.
let 's see, what can we add in?
i think we 'll be able to put it all in one senior and i think we 're good right there and you can see it makes for a nice beautiful cream and the starchy pasta water mixing with a little bit of the cream and the sauce will make it a cream oso and ice cream and it 's as well and all i need is just some people who are going to be willing to taste test this.
so let me have a few people are going to be willing to come around here and taste test come on in buddy what 's your name andrew, andrew, andrew, andrew where you from andrew, we had a seminarian, why do n't you get yourself before boy you do n't break grace before meals for goodness sakes i got what are you teaching these guys in there bless, this food bless everyone at holy trinity.
