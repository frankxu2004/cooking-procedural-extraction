i love pancakes.
you guys should love pancakes.
let 's make some pancakes.
i make the best pancakes in the world.
try to fuck with me on this you can too, alright so to make pancakes.
you need a few ingredients here.
this is everything that you need to make a perfect pancake.
you need flower.
what 's up you got some buttermilk.
if you do n't have buttermilk, you can use just milk and then add some white vinegar to it.
just like a tablespoon that 'll sour it up for you, we need that baking soda arm and hammer, then we got some baking powder.
that magic powder do n't put it in your nose that we got pam.
we got the grease lord, the OG.
we 've got blueberries for blueberry pancakes, little bananas, some beautiful eggs at room temperature, got some butter at room temperature last banalis for pancakes in canada at least i know where you guys are eating pancakes anywhere else you need some maple syrup.
someone had a pancake was about three weeks ago.
i had a pancake at work it was great.
these are all the tools you need, you need a whisk.
you need a spatula.
you need a spoon or ladle a dirty ass strainer, sifter.
we 're going to sift the dry ingredients.
so , first you always gotta remember you.
gotta separate your dry in your wet ingredients, right guys so first, well, fuck going to start with two cups of flour.
are going to sift all of the.
ingredients , you got that trap house vibe, making the fish scale.
here , get the fish scale.
you want the flower to be lumpy when you 're making pancakes.
but you do n't want the starting base to be lumpy, then we 're going to add fuck.
i like my shits, sugary so add some sugar that was about like three tablespoons, so baking powder, you always need a little bit more than baking.
soda , baking soda is like the crazy shit and baking powder is the stuff that will make it like fluffy.
so we just need a little bit like five key bumps that.
and then you got baking soda just a little bit.
and then we just sift that stuff in there, oh, also would always baking you, always gotta remember a little pinch of salt.
and then we just sift that stuff.
we got our flour baking soda.
baking powder salt sugar so there is your dry mix now to make your wet mix.
we 're going to need some eggs.
i need to melt some butter really quickly.
this is what not to do this pan is way too fucking hot this butter is now brown butter.
bush league move you gotta, start again.
you 're a fucking idiot.
so take about this much butter, that 's about like two tablespoons of butter.
you do n't want to be brown.
you wanted to be nice and yellow, so to make really good pancakes.
i 'm going to separate the eggs with the yolks in the whites to separate whites and yolks.
you can just pour it back and forth and let the shell kind of cut off the egg yolks and whites.
so for this amount of flour we 're going to need four eggs, see this yoke, see this yoke broke.
that 's no good.
can i check this out?
we take the egg whites were going to stir them up pretty much a whiskey sour, down here.
we 're going to add some buttermilk at home.
you 'll probably do about two cups, which is about that.
so then we have our yolks so we 're just going to start these guys up.
we 're going to add a little bit of sugar.
that 's a lot of sugar that 's OK, so we 're just going to start this up.
i should 've got a smaller bowl to do this idiot going to add some butter.
so when you 're pouring something like warm like this into egg yolks or any kind of eggs and stuff make sure it 's not hot, hot 'cause it 's going to turn your shit into scrambled eggs.
we go so we had our egg yolks in our sugar, and our butter and then we had her egg whites where their buttermilk.
then we can find those guys and then we had all of our dry ingredients and then we combine those, and we serve those in now.
we 're just going to pour in the flower.
the biggest way people fuck up pancakes is by oversteering pancakes, you do n't want to become flat and dense you want to just fold it in just enough to make him kind of fluffy, and those clumps of flowers that you see that you think, might be weird or really good.
because they 'll make things fluffier when you 're frying up the pancakes we put this in the fridge for a little second.
let this kind of just sit and marinate.
OK , we 're going to make classic just pancakes, and maple syrup and then we 're also going to throw some blueberries in some and we 're going to throw some little bananas in some too, is bananas are cute, are n't they?
i mean, you can just cut them up, here we got some nice local nature, right blueberries, either from product in USA so, we 're going to use those guys.
let 's start making some fucking pancakes, so you can kind of see it 's kind of set up there now.
