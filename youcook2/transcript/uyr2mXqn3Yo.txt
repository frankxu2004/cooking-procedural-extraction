if you 're looking for some healthy game day snack inspirations, and i 've got, you covered.
i hope he watched our previous video where i showed you how to make pub style sliders.
it was a collaboration between us an leave from six kids productions.
so if you have n't checked it out.
already make sure you do.
so i will leave a link for you.
so that 's why i wanted to make today.
my pita chips with roasted red pepper hummus, this recipe was in high demand when i was a caterer and today.
i 'm going to share my secrets with you, so grab your pita bread.
and i 'll show you how to make this these chips and dip.
so , easy to make that you 'll be wondering why you have n't been making them already.
and all you need for them is pita bread.
olive oil salt, pepper lemon red bell pepper chick peas tahini hot sauce and garlic before you start this recipe at all, you 're going to need one red bell pepper and put it over a gas flame.
and then all you do is just let it sit there for a few minutes until the skins blackened and blister.
when it does and use your tongs to flip it over to the other side, and you keep doing this until all sides of the pepper, including the top and bottom are nicely blistered and blackened and if you do n't have a gas stove, you can always do this under the broiler in the oven.
so just put on this sheet pan and do it that way, too once it you put it into a bowl cover.
it , with saran wrap, and let it seem so the skin can loosen away from the flesh.
after a few minutes just use your fingers to wipe away all of the black and parts ask the skin that 's just chart away.
then you can easily remove the stems and seeds and what you 're left with.
is this nice soft and sweet flesh so easy?
but if you do n't want to roast your own pepper i wo n't be mad at you if you do buy it from the jar OK.
so let 's get going.
now i have two clothes of coarsely chopped garlic going to add in your roasted red bell pepper.
this should help your garlic along work with a spatula, nearby so you can help yourself out.
now you have one fifteen and a half ounce, can of drained and rinsed, chickpeas you guys made chickpeas or garbanzo beans.
let me know in the comments.
this is the most important ingredient for hummus, tahini OK, and tahini is just a sesame E paste three tablespoons OK three tablespoons of lemon juice four to five dashes of hot sauce, depending on how you like it, the heat and then you 're going to start off with half a teaspoon of kosher salt, and if you wanted, a little bit more season, then added at the end.
but this is a good start some, pepper, and i have one to two tablespoons of water.
so if i need it, i 'm going to add it, you know, i think i like my hummus a little chunky, if you did n't add the roasted red bell pepper, you might need it.
because it 'll be too thick.
but the bell pepper kind of add a little liquid on its own.
so i 'm going to leave it out alright come on guys that was super easy right and just to make things a little bit prettier from presentation.
i 'm just going to do a little scooby scoops, and then drizzle with some olive oil perfect set this aside, you could n't even make this a day in advance and keep it in your fridge.
dip , let 's move on to the pita chips.
now this is just for two.
so i 'm only going to use two pieces of pita bread and this will make about sixteen little peter points or triangles.
so cut your bread into quarters and then cut each quarter in half and trust me, these are thick chips of a little goes a long way.
and then i just placed them on a tray.
can you imagine how many of these, i had to make when i was catering that was no joke?
now i will admit in my catering days.
i did split the pitas in half see.
how they open up like a beak.
i did split them in half if they were thinner and you can do that too.
if you 're kind of like bread conscious, you can just make them thinner and then cook them for less time.
now all you need is olive oil salt and pepper.
if you want to be more fancy go ahead add garlic powder.
i 've done it with garlic powder and crushed.
oregano dried oregano, you can also add spices on top such as cumin and chili.
so really go nuts, and then you just sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper flip them over and repeat make sure you give them a good.
even brushing because you want them to crisp up nicely for you.
these taste best on the same day that they 're made.
sometimes you have luck with having them good the next day.
two depending on how chris you made the pitas, the oven is set to three hundred and seventy five degrees.
and you 're just going to pop these into the oven for about ten minutes.
so after five minutes, you 're just going to rotate the chips if they get crisp on the other side, as well, too brown and crispy to the touch then, you know, they 're good.
you do n't want them really to be chewy in the middle because they have a tendency to do that, too.
so just watch it make sure they 're nice and dry, are you ready to chip and dip?
nice consistency, i was thinking the exact same thing.
oh , so crispy and crunchy what they hinted at olive oil.
the homeless is so creamy and smooth.
it is you can take that hint of garlic and a hint of sweetness from the roasted red pepper.
and if you do n't want to just munch on peter chips all day, and then you compare it with some fresh veggies it goes great with celery.
once you give it a try, he had really goes, well together nice, refreshing crunch.
this is just great cinnamon and TV, enjoy the game kind of snack about pre game coverage.
a three hour coverage and the post coverage for substitutions.
obviously you can eat veggies.
instead of pita chips and for the hummus if you do n't want to use roasted red pepper whether it 's from a jar or roasting it yourself you can also give it a twist by adding in some marinated, artichokes for a little bit of a tangy , zing.
you could also use pesto for a little brightness of herbaceous flavor and you could always.
