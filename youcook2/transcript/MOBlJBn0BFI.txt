hi , yeah, i 'm sure tom welcome to fortune cooking today.
i 'm going to show you a really popular dish in the asian family.
it 's called mapo tofu.
you can make vegetarian, or you can have shrimp or pork or any other mapleton with find the main ingredient is this black bean paste alright.
they have, garlic ginger, an black, bean and hot pepper, and another ingredient that i like to introduce, is samba a lot of people know?
is vegetarian hot chili with bunch of vegetable an pepper, ann lime everything, go together?
there 's a really good one.
i feel like very spicy today, so we have cilantro cooking wine soy sauce, and we 're going to guarantee some ginger couple of slides.
we want to have a find chart, OK.
and then come across, or you can greater ginger ground ginger.
or you can buy it at ginger, uh, in the jar alright, then just done put on the site and.
now the garlic smash it really good and cut it really fine those are the basic ingredient and is a very popular dish.
go really good with the rice and some people like to put it in the different version, they can do some vegetable peppers.
those are good and mushroom and i have half of the sweet onion.
and you kind of redefined two OK just like this and the next thing is i have this green onion for the garnishing.
i like to cut it.
usually like to cut with a diagonally, like this, just end up this way and just give them a really fine shop.
and i usually save the white part of the green onion, which is a scallion.
this is for the garnishing.
so i put it aside.
an what happened, is that i can use that to salted with my onion with garlic when the ginger will give them a really nice flavor OK?
all right now we have to take care, our tofu.
this is part of the main ingredient too, as well, so this tofu is kind of like a medium firm alright.
you can get soft or really firm.
ann we love to full, i mean, if you just take the plain tofu is no flavor to it.
but if, you know, how to cook it and take care of it, it will give you really great flavor.
so what i 'm going to do is i usually cutting between split into half alright.
this , and then in the middle and then two more cut here.
so we have four section now, and here i go to the middle two and the same thing alright that 's total we ready to cook keoua on medium one tablespoon of the high smoke point, cooking oil.
the mother this world like this, and then i will put the onion ginger garlic in the green onion first.
so OK until fragrant, pick up our minute though about minutes is what they look like smells.
so good is the black bean paste and there 's a somber hot sauce very easy to make, go really good with the rice so delicious.
no so good, if you do n't want to spicy this reduce the hot sauce, but you can have a little spicy to it, anna is your great dish.
with shrimp of course here we go.
so people are not a minute, so after minutes for some wine, but the alcohol would reduce a little bit, skies are and let them cook for another minute.
medium heat about minute.
you got all the hot sauce and the black bean and all the onion and everything.
garlic ginger let them cook little bit, get the flavor out.
and you can add vegetable stock.
oh , i just used turn water OK, and.
now there a little bit, and put your lips on it, it 's nice to have a walk with the lids.
because it 's hard to cook at home.
because the temperature user is not as hot as powerful at a restaurant unless you have a commercial stove at home, which is really nice.
but i always get a lot with that will help to raise up your temperature in the walk after you bring up to the boil and the sauce is nice and happy.
all cook together, and you just put a tofu him gently just like this.
you do n't want to disturb that over too much alright just like this an tofu will absorb the sauce.
an you need to let them cook a little bit, so i 'm going to turn into higher.
then i put my lip back on and let them slowly cook once you bring up to the boil again, and just let them cook medium high, and just let the source code for like i would say five to ten minutes and just let all the ingredients all the spices came in through the tofu an you do n't need to start a to fool just keep control on the temperature, of course, make sure they 're not over burn by just go like this and let them cook until you can see the source start ticking little bit, it 's about four minutes occasionally, you go like this you see the source they kind of, like fill over cover up the tofu.
because you 're not going to, you know, stir fry the tofu right.
now you just gotta let them slow cook an.
now is the time to get to try your sauce or nice flavor, spicy powerful boy spicy, good, some people want to add some sweetness to it.
little bit sugar, or just the way it is.
leave , it just like this, if you want, you can have a touch of the half teaspoon of the brown sugar.
it will be good so right now at this point is resources dry out pretty good.
so , some people were not touch anything just like this.
i finish up and they can serve.
but i 'd like to add it.
but , uh, i have a potato starch not much maybe one teaspoon potato starch because i had a little bit thicker just how you do it.
you do n't flip the talk with too much.
you just count like more like this.
OK , i have like maybe just a little bit tiny potato starch, not even.
like one third teaspoon with some cold water and the end very important is sesame E oil like this is done does mapo tofu is done smell.
so , good, happy.
