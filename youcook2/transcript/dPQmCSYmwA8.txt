membranes , this breakfast, come from island and more the pancakes made from potato, potato rolls.
so explain more about this, this is an irish potato kate going to make our very own using potato flour and chive , again.
we can use that to sandwich between roasted tomatoes, black pudding, and some streaky bacon and awesome brunch dish that we can make easy peasy.
no trouble tool starts with potato.
so a couple large potatoes just peeled quartered put into cold salted water and brought up to the board for about fifteen minutes or so.
and you end up with that, so there we go we just jump that step just drain the potatoes and put them back into our pan and now mash.
so we just want to completely dry matter the potatoes to know added butter or anything like that.
so just seeing that off at this point plenty of salt and pepper.
so this republican violent, or north an item when i was in pacific island in place called dead in hotel, i worked there for years and they used to use these all the time.
but you can point them pre.
made me buy them in supermarkets.
but you see how simply tower.
you can actually make a poem.
it 'll just take some chives to give those equipped sliced up.
and if your potato is well matched which i think it is masha and adding our flower.
so , this seems like potato bread.
really i suppose you 're going to roll out.
we 're going to cook it and use it to sandwich two things together.
so they often either using fried with a brunch or with breakfast once you got all that flower combined, i 'm going to put the chimes in.
we 're now quick hands.
and then get some states are going to stop mold in this is going to be quite hot, but, you know, i have weekends a good dusting of flour on our board, and then we take what is.
now this kind of mashed potato bread almost though.
because the flower producer and will put enough just to make the base of our frying pan.
so we want to write back i think we just kind of passed out to a nice circle that 's fairly thick keep it nice and round as you go and kind of level all over, and i 'm going to put a plug of oil into while frying pan and we.
now need to do is fry this off.
so nice and thin all over this is similar to naki potato sense or thicken, with flour difference being is not enriched with egg or cheese or anything like that and we 're going to try it instead of, buying it.
so at this stage we take our potato for nice flowery bottom noise around and that 's going to go in here taking fall it, and then they call it up with your potato pancake content or fire the ark and see how it works so, we just throw it on that side for a couple of minutes, then we 'll turn it over and do the same on the other while we 're waiting for that to do will make our middle OK we 're going to sandwich in between.
so some streaky bacon, if you can just learn i can do and i 've got some black pudding here, which i 'm going to do is take off the kind of plasticky membrane could we explain a bit more about black pudding.
because i have a bad about it that 's awesome, awesome pork based product that uses pigs blood.
so that people are very concerned.
by and, they know, it 's got blood in it but it 's just a really good kind of sausage blood sausage what worth.
it right you have n't already tried it black pudding bacon trip, they come from the same animal.
exactly the same animal.
so faking street is going to come from the back of the back of the pig down there and this is a whole number of variety, different bits of pig.
but we need to find K without sore thing.
so if you happen to be they can keep that queen game, well, the bacon black pudding explosive grill under there, we can actually flip a potato fall over that you got a nice kind of crispy bottom that is another couple of minutes in the other side.
what 's under the grill needs couple minutes as well to finish cooking through and then we can show you how to pile up our breakfast.
if you can grab our grilled stuff out of little look at our potato file, which we can just slide out onto the table there and then cut into quarters.
traditionally , i do n't know why.
but ted files, always serving triangles now what we need is something to place it up on i 'm sorry sometimes.
the places up on this is definitely a leprechauns stool now.
and i was the one being generalistic, it 's nice chopping board, and we 're going to do is play store potato file on the bottom there, layer up everything in the middle.
so some strips of bacon.
but about pudding roasted tomatoes and then other one that you 've got plenty more to make another one on top of the loads and, loads, and loads going on to there, we go it 's our irish potato cake breakfast.
sorted and i think it needs a good splodge of sorts, as well, so dig into that.
i 'm generally looking forward to this policy graham, not on my nelly did i think it would taste this good potato black pudding now.
that is, an irish breakfast.
i would definitely have this for the west.
my life if i could you have bewitched me cause it is good lots of people have done since we do n't have any girls minutes 'cause this is definitely a voice like enough with the irish musicians , already.
