hey dudes on hila welcome to hilah cooking, so you 'll know that i love tacos and tex, mex and mexican food.
but today, i 'm going to show you the mother of all tex, mex dishes.
and , that is decrease the beef tagoo.
anne , i 'm super excited about it.
this is aligned favorite thing in the world to eat, and i 've got a cool little trick to show you to make your own shells cook crispy.
taco , the crisper, tackled the cripple beatles, first step is we 're going to saute or onions until they are translucent 's.
let 's give these about five minutes, or so, OK, now it 's time to add my human seed, and i do n't know.
lazy to grind it up making his ground.
whatever , but i 'm put these in, in the hot pan and kind of let them get a little bit toasty.
it 's going to really bring out their aromatic oils, and then i 've got my chili powder, and this is just like a hancho chili powder.
but whatever you got on hand will do just fine.
and then the jalapeno and garlic an three peppers going to put in a little bit of crushed red chili flakes to leave that out if you want to keep it a little milder, and you can also see the jalapenos if you want to keep it mild.
and now i 'm going to show you the trick to get like super fine little ground, beef crumbles like they have at taco bell, which i used to love crispy taco bell tacos, when i was a kid or having not had one in years.
but i can make him at home.
now so screw you.
taco bell, we 're just going to have some water maybe half a cup invidious beer also or broth, but water works just fine.
so kind of get this all mixed up.
water is just going to help, help you be able to kind of like break it into smaller pieces, and it keeps it real moist 'cause i 'm using a lean ground beef here.
ninety percent lean.
see how this is already starting to look a little bit like taco bell, OK not really right now it looks a little bit gross.
i know, but just give it about five or ten minutes.
and i 'm going to add some salts and tomato paste.
and actually if you wanted to just use tomato sauce instead of the water that would take the place for the tomato paste and water both, and i 'll give it a little nice color little depth of flavor.
cool , so i 'm just going to let this simmer for about ten minutes, keep an eye on it, store it once in awhile.
keep it moving around.
so it stays in a little tiny pieces, and then we go in and make some crisp attack goes cruise, but taco cook.
i 'll stop singing that song.
so the meats actually cooked now.
there 's still a lot of liquid left now.
i 'm going to add the oregano just wanna crumble it up when you throw it in to bring out more info flavors, and then we 're just going to let this cook for maybe another five minutes until the water has evaporated out.
and then we 're going to make jogos.
so i 've got these shells here that i baked an.
all i did was sprinkle.
some corn tortillas with a little bit of water stick 'em in the microwave for like, thirty seconds just to steam and soften them up, and then spray them down with some non stick cooking spray or whatever.
or you could use a little basting brushes and then throw in the oven lane over the rack bars like that and bake them for like nine minutes, and then pull them off of the racks and put it on a cookie sheet and then turn the oven off and left him in there, just while the oven cooled off.
and that 's just make sure that they get extra crispy and kind of like crisp and not just like chili and weird.
so anyway, you could totally buy shells.
but i do n't know i thought.
this was a pretty cute little idea, an and their low fat, too, so excellent, my little taco shell guy killa.
but am i.
the fun thing is there, so messy and then you can put whatever you want.
but i like cheese and tomato and i put the cheese sound first.
so it gets a little melty and some lettuce or in this case, i 'm actually using shredded cabbage 'cause that 's what i had on hand, and i like to put a little bit of my homemade green salsa.
now post the link for that , too.
if you want to make that it 's delish OK here.
i go worlds, messiest food is about to get all over my dress.
i think probably hopefully not alright.
well , i hope you try this recipe.
if you have any questions in the comments below, and i will get to him as soon as i can.
thanks so much for watching, and i hope you enjoy these crispy beef tacos.
