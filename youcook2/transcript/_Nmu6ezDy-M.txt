hi , i 'm john coletta.
and the executive chef and managing partner of cortino, dies tirante was located on the corner.
of , of ontario and state here in chicago, illinois.
i 've also got a pasta cookbook that 's called two hundred and fifty, true italian pasta dishes, which hopefully you get the opportunity to experience and give me some feedback as to what we 've prepared for you today we 're going to make an authentic penela vodka and we 're going to start off by using some extra virgin olive oil.
some garlic cloves.
and we 're just going to get the flavors into the olive oil, some diced tomatoes.
some canned peeled tomatoes a little bit of cream.
and then we 're going to add the pen at the end and some basil, and it 's going to be amazing, come over with me to the stove.
OK , we 've added some oil now.
we 're going to add some garlic going to get that going.
we 've got some boiling water going to add dependent.
that 's about three quarters of a pound and we 're going to add about an ounce and a half of salt.
and we 're going to.
now we 're getting all the flavors from the garlic into the olive oil, and that 's going to take us a moment out, once we 've got all of the flavors out of the garlic.
now , we add diced tomatoes and a little bit of vodka.
now we 're going to take a little bit of the pasta water.
and we 're going to let that simmer going to check the pasta in just a moment to make sure that it 's at the al dente stage.
it 's got another two minutes to go OK.
and you know, when it 's firm, that 's when we want to remove it, it 's a little bit too hard right.
now and you can see all the flavors coming together here.
now we 're going to add a little bit of cream ever so gently.
OK , we 're going to bring these OK now.
this was a dish that was happened to be created in rome, where the vodka came from nobody knows.
but we know this much it 's a lot of fun to cook, and it 's certainly a lot of fun to eat.
also , so now we 're going to get all these flavors working, and this takes about a good twenty minutes.
but it 's worth the time in the wider.
the pan, the faster the cooking.
so we want to make sure that we 've got all these flavors working together and will lower the heat.
now we want to get it to a medium flame, and we want to time the cooking of the pasta, and the finishing of the sauce.
so once we can get that together, we 're ready for an incredible penela vodka.
we 're going to add the by al dente panda.
here we go.
now you guys, you can see the pen that have been cooked al dente, there was enough sauce to coat the pendant.
the flavors from dependent from the vodka and the tomatoes have been transferred to the pasta and this is going to be roughly about a three ounce portion of pasta, which i believe to be an adequate amount going to add some grandpa dano nicely graded in a couple of sprigs of torn basil, and we have a very simple.
and delicious vanilla vodka, thank you for giving me the opportunity to bring these great preparations to you.
i can be contacted for any feedback at WWW dot quartino chicago dot com.
