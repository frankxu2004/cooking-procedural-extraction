there 's a small bakery in san francisco, called tartine, and it 's famous for its bread and pastries, one of my favorite things to order is the croak, monsour.
it 's an open faced sandwich layered with a creamy, béchamel sauce and topped with smoked ham and gree air.
it 's so seemingly simple to make and when the flavor combinations are perfect.
the result is this cheesy french sandwich that 's perfect for breakfast or lunch for the basha mel sauce.
i 'm using two tablespoons of unsalted butter things have all purpose flour when and a quarter cup of warmed whole milk, half a teaspoon of nat may and some salt and pepper for the crook.
once you 're i 'm going to use two slices of day old bread about an inch thick.
i 'm using this round country loaf, two big slices of smoked ham and four slices of gruyere cheese.
first , i 'm starting with the béchamel sauce.
i melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat for about a minute.
now i 'm adding in a flower and whisking it until the mixture bubbles a bit per minute.
what i 'm doing here is cooking out that raw flour taste, but doing it just enough so that it does n't brown.
then i whisk in the milk and just let it boil to pick it up.
then i 'll just sprinkle in my nutmeg because that 's essential to a besham L sauce and then season it with some salt and pepper.
and then i 'll set it aside now to make my crook once you 're.
i start by preheating the oven to four hundred and twenty, five degrees.
i spread a quarter cup of béchamel sauce onto each slice of bread and then i top it with a slice of ham and two slices of cheese.
then i 'll bake it on a sheet until the cheese is bubbling and brown.
this will take ten to twelve minutes.
if you 're ever in san francisco be sure to stop by tartine and give their croque-monsieur, try another personal favorite.
is there banana cream pie?
and also, there bread, now i 'll take it out of the oven and let it cool for about a minute.
i 'll pair it with some salad, and then it 's fun a petite and there, you have it the croak, monsour.
