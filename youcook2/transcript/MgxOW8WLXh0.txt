we 're making up some chicken curry, which is a dish really popular in many parts of southeast asia in india.
it contains some of the ingredients that i really love such as curry ginger coconut milk, etc.
it 's relatively easy to make, i know you 're going to love it.
so let 's get started.
what i have here some boneless, skinless chicken breasts you can use just about any cuts.
you want i just find these are a little bit healthier.
and i 'm just going to cut these into cubes.
the size is really entirely up to you, but this is about the size.
i like next, i 'm going to add some cooking oil to a preheated pain.
add the onions in followed by the ginger the garlic, and i 'm just going to stir and saute these for a minute or two.
just until the onions begin to turn translucent and everything becomes fragrant.
now what i 'm going to do is add in the chicken.
add up going to stir and fry it for about six to seven minutes just until it begins to turn light brown.
now the chicken is light brown.
we 're going to add in the curry powder.
the hot pepper flakes some solve a dusting of freshly ground pepper.
the freshly chopped tomatoes, and i 'm just going to stir in fry.
this , until the chicken is nicely coated with the curry and the tomatoes had begun to turn.
softon , wilt, a little bit, now what i 'm going to do is add in the coconut milk.
if you wanted a little bit healthier you can always use yogurt.
but i love the taste of coconut milk, and of course, we 're going to give this a slight stir.
bring it to a boil.
and we 're just going to slip a lid over this and let us simmer over medium.
low heat for about thirty minutes after thirty minutes.
the chicken is fully cooked.
so we 're going to add in the cilantro and some lemon juice to balance out the taste at this point in time you can give it a taste test and add any additional spices that you feel it needs, and believe me, the smell of curry is filled the air in.
it smells absolutely incredible.
and you 're ready to serve and here it is our delicious chicken curry.
