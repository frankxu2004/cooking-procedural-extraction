hi guys, i 'm laura vitali, another physical sort of learning kitchen.
i want to share with you.
my avocado, hummus, which is.
so easy and simple.
but perfect for the summer time, and it 's just a really great dip to have whether you 've got people coming around.
or it 's a really great thing to have.
if you 're anything like my husband, and i and we love that kind of dinner when you can pick it things will make it like a biscuit dough and make a little bit of humason just pick here and there.
and this is incredibly easy and simple and great to use up those avocado trees that are just too send it to slice, and you.
so that you know, really pretty in salads, this is perfect, the ingredients will need are few and very simple, and you 're going to start off with a can of chickpeas, which i have drained and rinsed well an avocado lots of parsley, garlic pinch, a hot pepper flakes this is n't tahini paste, this is just on sesame E seed paste that i 've made myself, which is gorgeous olive oil salt pepper, some lemon juice dented, could n't be any easier.
now this by no means is like an authentic hummus recipe.
but it is authentically delicious i can promise you that i 'm going to add pretty much everything in my food processor my avocado?
my , my parsley, my garlic that this is tahini, which is really just sesame E seed paste.
and i really enjoy making my own once in awhile because i can to stop the sesame E seeds and really bring out there.
gorgeous flavor, and also i delete some of it.
i like to leave it chunky side that way, do sesame E seeds sort of really come through?
you can still sit a sesame E seeds all over the spooning the little brown bits or the sesame E seeds that are toasted when you really get that really beautiful flavor and then i 'm going to just add the juice of one lemon you might want to do half a lemon.
but i really like quite a bit of tang here.
especially with the avocado, i feel like it 's really needs it.
so i 'm just giving it a good squeeze.
good grading of salt pepper and a good pinch of salt.
now do n't be shy.
but the salts.
because the avocado really needs it.
because avocados are rich in texture quite bland.
so the salt really brings up beautiful flavors of an avocado.
but the top bone i 'm just going to post this.
now that it 's nice and chunky.
i 'm going to start to drizzle in my olive oil and blend until it 's nice poop.
just going to taste us for seasoning that 's perfect, that is perfection.
it 's so creamy and absolutely lovely and i can really smell the garlic.
but because of the avocado, it 's not as strong as you think it might be.
you can also, of course just use one close of two is a bit much for you, but look at that beautiful color.
i love that there 's still specs of green, from the parsley, and it 's just a beautiful color from the avocado.
i love this and then of course, you need to serve this with some good dipping things or whatever you want to call him.
pita bread pita chips is always great.
i really prefer like nice cars vegetables, they wanna do really quickly, is just sort of smooth?
the top, and then i love this look at the color of that is that not gorgeous drizzle on just a touch more olive oil and then a pinch of hot pepper flakes.
so lovely to get a little hint of heat without cool, creamy guacamole, guacamole hummus.
well , really is like a hybrid between a remarkable in hummus and then the vegetables i love or some beautiful router should look at these pink ones.
these red wines little baby white, one, i 've got some carrots i 've got lovely baby grape tomatoes strips of red bell pepper flakes and some snap peas look at the color of this call.
beautiful forgot, so one and got a slight hundred feet from the hot pepper flakes but it 's so creamy.
garlic comes through D lightful warren, next nakama had the recipe waiting for you and i hope we enjoy spending time with me.
and if you do recreate this recipe, do n't forget to share with me on social media and going back for second because no one else is here?
we can just bring some with me.
and i said next time.
