hi , seth roberts from the willow room today.
we 're going to make potato lochees.
is very simple recipe?
it 's very good what we have his potatoes.
i 've already pilled these you need, five large potatoes and what we 're going to do is great.
these , this is a box grater.
if you have a food processor at home with a greater grading attachment that 'll work also so i 'm going to do is great to five potatoes.
OK , we have our potatoes, graded, this is what they should look like they 're going to start turning oxidizing.
but that 's perfectly fine.
we have an onion we 're going to create this also.
this is perfectly acceptable to have that much of the onion left, so you do n't break your fingers off, uh, and there 's our grated onion.
we just throw this into the potatoes, give it a little toss.
OK , now we 're going to try to squeeze some of the moisture out of these, you can press it through a kolander.
i find it this is better this way squeezed all the moisture out of this, you can see there 's quite a lot of moisture in there would n't be good.
if we did n't squeeze it so our next step is to crack are eggs not three eights here.
we 're going to throw our garlic in here which is one teaspoon of garlic.
and we 're going to look for a job or this over our potatoes, season, with salt and pepper.
and we need a third of a cup of flour.
i like to do is.
mix this first incorporate the flour that 's basically it.
i 'd like to sit for about five minutes, and will activate the storage and a flower and some of the stars from the potatoes will come back and talk to home together.
OK , are oil was hot?
it took a little bit of our mix forming into a, a little cake like that.
we 're a job come into the world.
some people prefer these to be flatter.
i like my speed.
i guess it 's called a medium thickness, OK, i have this on medium heat.
you want to cook a money side for about two to three minutes.
if you 're if you 're doing these ahead of time and you have a lot of company you can have the oven hot and just hold him in the oven, works fine OK these have been cooking, about six to seven minutes to pull him out and let him drain on this paper towels i have a paper towel you can pass some of the excess oil off, all right we 're going to do.
now is just put it on this place and with a little sour cream and chives here, you can serve it on the side or want to take a pancake and can also use applesauce, which is very good, too.
so that said i hope you enjoy it until.
he well, thanks.
