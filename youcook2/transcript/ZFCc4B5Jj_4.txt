it 's julie today will be making general so and now.
this recipe was given to me by my friend, jacques kafani, from the cooking with jack show, jack already made a video for this, and you might think well, wait a minute.
why would you make it if you already made it well, before i recommend another?
you tuber to you guys.

so now let 's get started.
so in soboli through anything cornstarch soy sauce and two eggs i follow this recipe exactly how jack made it except the only difference is that i decided to use two eggs instead of one julie.
there 's just one egg in there.
my camera did n't catch me adding the extra egg, but trust me, he got in there.
this texture was perfect for me and very easy to dip the chicken, and i used three pounds of chicken breast, and i just cut them into bite size pieces, make sure to coat each piece of chicken, well and shake off any excess.
i fried my chicken in batches.
i use vegetable oil, cook the chicken for about four to five minutes.
chicken came out super juicy, and crispy on the outside, and from.
now on, a plan on frying all of my chick in this way i think all fried chicken should look like this color is beautiful and to be honest, i could have stopped right here 'cause these little chicken bites were.
so delicious, but no worries i did n't stop by continued with the recipe, i threw in some cornstarch water soy sauce, mince, garlic, sugar chicken stock white vinegar and some white wine give everything a whisk, and i will say that you should not eat this everyday.
also , this dish is meant for sharing that looks like my morning coffee by.
and do n't think i 'm lecturing you guys for the most part.
i get really sweet positive comments.
thank you for that.
however , once in a while a member of the you tube culinary police likes to stop by and make sure that everything is healthy in clean in a skillet with some olive oil i saute some green onions and some dried chili peppers jack remove the seeds i left them in that is, completely optional i like really spicy food.
however , the finished result was not spicy.
although general so chicken is normally not supposed to be spicy i would say has a sweet and salty taste, which is what makes it.
i poured in the corn starch and soy sauce mixture and let it cook over medium high heat for about five to six minutes and, before you know, it, it will be thick and velvety.
you want to toss in your chick in give it a stir.
let it cook for an additional five minutes on low heat, and then it 's ready to serve.
i serve this with white rice, i did n't season the rice because the sauce from the chicken will give the rice all the flavor.
it means i hope you guys give this recipe a try.
