hi , guys alarm italian, on this opposite of laura in the kitchen i want to show you how to make some ground, beef.
top goes really simple.
yet it 's been interested here for so long and since cinco, tamayo is quickly approaching.
i figured it be a perfect time for do with him tonight at your house 'cause this is what we 're doing in the battalion castle this year.
and i 'm really excited to share the recipe with you now.
i make tons of different variations of tacos.
i make pulled pork tacos.
i make grilled tacos tons, basic ground beef that everyone knows.
it 's really simple.
the ingredients do n't need to.
just some ground beef.
you need some finely chopped onion.
this is one small onion and for spices, and you 're going to need some ground.
chili onion, garlic paprika, oregano cumin ground coriander, some cornstarch, black pepper tomato sauce water, some light to olive oil, or you could use some vegetable oil and some salt that said you could also, of course, this is a packet of taco, seasoning.
but police often i 'm always advising people against it.
because if you 've got spices inner heat in your couple words in your pantry, you could make your very own taco seasoning one which is what i do.
so let 's get started.
i 've gotta still here with high size.
with a few tablespoons a couple tablespoons of light out of order preheating it, says that i 'm going to add in my ground beef.
so i 'm just going to break it up as much as i can with my one spoon.
and , this is alexis cook for about five to six minutes.
one such mostly cooked through, ask looking, good, i 'm gonna add in my onion.
now if your beef, you know, you take, get a lot of fat vendors out from it, then by all means just get rid of him.
but mine really did in is you can see it 's going to whole lot in there at all or whatever, then there it 's going to be just enough to cook the onions i 've just turned the heat down to that medium halfway between medium and medium, low and it 's going to let my onions cook for about five to six minutes or until they have cooked down quite a bit you 're still going to break up my me as much as possible.
but that 's about it and i looks great.
now at this point i 'm going to see them this with some salts and.
now this is why i prefer making my own taco seasoning.
because i 'd like to be able to control how much salt was into my food OK.
so this is really turn this back up while i actually have n't turned it back up the medium.
it was n't about medium low.
now i 'm going to take my water.
my tomato sauce and i just say to mater.
wow , call nuha, cabul airy.
they are and then just take all my spices, and my cornstarch to cornstarch is what thickens the sauce so that 's key.
here makes this up just like you would regular taco seasonings.
your taco seasoning packet just pour it in boo, and i 'm gonna do now is like the simmer for about ten minutes or until the liquid has reduced.
a big an assault a stick and then we 'll be ready to serve.
and i 'll show you how i license service where it 's like all my little fixins that is done an look at that now.
just so you know, this recipe works just as well with ground turkey or ground chick.
in still has delicious now, this is done.
and these are some of my must have toppings you need your pico.
i got some black bean salsa here that i adore some guacamole.
i 've got some shredded lettuce.
of course, we need to tackle shelves that can be hard, soft, you name it, whatever tickles your fancy and then optional.
well , i always on the table.
anyway , some sour cream.
and shredded cheddar.
i do n't gravitate towards the sour cream and shredded cheddar.
i like the creaminess to come from the guacamole.
and i like, i mean, i 'm not a big fan of the cheddar, but whatever get tickles your fancy like i said, you can do whatever topping.
you want now.
i 'm going to get mine started, and i 'm going to warn you that this is probably going to look ridiculous, just because, while the taco meats and like the taco, filling itself is delicious involve, the toppings.
i love like mounting on toppings.
i do n't know why i just precious that 's probably why, oh, yes, god, i had my guac that 's got that creaminess, the line, oh, yeah, and then just a little bit of lettuce right over the top this is going to look embarrassing.
so do not judge me.
because i 'm sure that you have looks like this once or twice eating taco satellite will beat your success in your house.
if you make this recipe hum incredibly simple and easy, you can use any top, and you want it makes a feast for everyone.
