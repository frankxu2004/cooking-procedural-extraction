hey guys, thanks for stuff, buy ballistic barbeque, another edition of grand theft burger.
today 's victim fuddruckers the hangover burger, let 's get going alright, so one of the things that makes record such a good burger is simply the meat.
they grind their meat in house, which is what i did.
i got a really good deal on some decent rib eye and makes the best hamburgers.
it 's one of my favorite meats and the price i paid for these.
it was about the same as i would have paid for her sirloin or check, so ca n't beat it.
really good marbling, you want some nice fat content in a good hamburger now.
fuddruckers , they sell their burgers in one quarter, one third and one half pound sizes, i 'm not going to wear mine.
but i 'm probably going to go for right around the third between a third and a half now, there patties are perfectly shaped there 's nothing your regular.
but the shape at all, which is why i 'm using this form here when i try to come as close as i can to the way their burgers look.
now i am obviously packing this.
but i 'm paying close attention are not packing it, too hard, there we go looks like a thug director, patty i 'm pretty happy with this we 're going to go ahead and set this aside and move on to the.
next step, which is their seasoning salt alright.
now fuddruckers seasons, there patties with the seasoning salt that they actually brand is pretty good stuff and i found a really good copycat recipe on top secret recipes, dot com thank you guys.
so we 're going to start off with two teaspoons of paprika one and a half teaspoons black pepper one and a quarter teaspoon salt one half teaspoon brown sugar, one quarter teaspoon, garlic powder, one quarter, teaspoon onion powder in one quarter teaspoon, cayenne pepper, is going to give that a good mix and there we go it 's top grills almost ready.
so much out of patty right guys.
so fuddruckers cook their burgers on a flat top we 're going to be using the mojo, griddle today, love cooking on this thing it really replicates the type of cooking surface that you get, in those restaurants season at patty with that seasoning salt we made get it down here is hot.
now this hangover burger has bacon on it and we 're going to go ahead and start scripting up to bacon right.
because looking pretty good, we 're going to go ahead and take this off at his side for as soon as you can see, i 'm getting some nice color up the side of this burger we 're going to go ahead and flip it score just crust we go ahead and put on some cheddar cheese right, that 's what i 'm looking for now.
what i 'm going to do is move this burger up to the cooler side here.
and we 're going to do something again.
defines this burger.
this hangover burger now just so you guys know.
i only have charcoal on one side of my grill on this half the grill.
this side is strictly radiant heat which is what i want is you 're going to see in a minute.
here they have a fried egg on top of this burger little water.
now the buns are also another signature thing for fuddruckers they take their own buns.
i have some bunch here.
i actually bought at fuddruckers right here going to give these just a little bit of a toast things coming along.
fine , we 're going to go ahead and give us a flip.
gorgeous toast on the bread, try guys eggs, done.
let 's go ahead and make us a hangover burger right now when you buy a burger at fuddruckers.
even one of their signature burgers, they have this unbelievable produce bar where you can build the burger how you want it different types of lettuce.
tomato sauces you name it, onion good stuff.
so this is one of their signature burgers to hangover burger.
but it does n't come with any lettuce or tomato or anything on it.
so i 'm going to go ahead and do it as i would do at the restaurant going to lay down some nice green leaf.
lettuce couple thin slices of tomato, then that burger is going to go down.
and the slices of bacon in that egg on top no, of course, you have the options of mustard ketchup barbecue sauce whatever the preferred condiment for the hangover burger is good old, A one steak sauce.
that 's the way I like to have it top.
it , without beautiful, fresh mcbaine, there he go guys.
skip the shot.
this is going to be yet another messy.
one can tell you that right.
now so good guys that steak sauce just really does the beef well, and that egg i did n't really used to be into eggs on burgers until just recently.
anyway guys, thanks for stopping by.
keep the suggestions coming.
see you in the next video chairs.
