but of those old great british classics cottage pie very simple good ments onions, garlic bay, leaf little time was the source, tomato puri and of course to stop.
so again hot pan.
their loyal when hot and with the beef to cook the beef.
get a bit of color, lee sin je extract, the fat out trade off, then, we add the fried onions and the fried garlic and together they go was to source use that down stop pump tiny bit of tomato puri, sterritt round cook it a little bit little water.
approx half a liter very simple and cooked about an hour, an hour, and a half.
so it really cooks them with a lot of people is, they do n't cook their minutes enough.
and we go limit and as you can see i 've just put it in the pan.
i have n't moved it white because the more i move it, the more i take the heat out of the pan.
if i keep on stirring and mixing a mixing it back in by allowing it just to stay still having confidence in my pan to do the work for me each is, releases batteries.
i cannot get a true caramelization into moment until i got the water out of it.
and then i can start to break it all up a lot of people would have strained the water off.
but my straying off what are you doing, you 're pulling away a certain percentage of flavor by leaving the pan on the heat, allowing the water to evaporate by reduction are intensifying the flavor.
so now it 's hard to break it up release that lasted of water, and then we can start to singit cameras in orbiting filson.
currently , say you 're cooking minced lamb for shepherds pie.
exactly the same method, same principles applied so as you can see now all the water being evaporated.
and there 's just a little bit of caramelization on some of the meat that 's enough transfer payments into the calendar to drain off the excess oil, the loyal half onion, the low garlic just cut coarsely.
i think the secret of shepherds pie cottage pie is method and perfection is lots of little things, done, well, it 's as simple as that question why we 're doing what we 're doing is like.
now were cooking the onions and the guy with a little bit of color, when that 's got to that stage of cooking.
i think you have to question what you 're trying to create.
i think whenever i cook i always think about what i 'm cooking always think what do i want to achieve at the end of it.
so i have a picture in my mind, i can almost see it before i have cooked.
it , yeah, there 's a taste which i want.
and so that might work.
i achieving that taste tiny bit of flower.
just gives it that little bit of body when i said, tiny bit is just a pinch talking with the minutes was the source is used that down tablespoon.
tomato puri and the last thing to do is approx half liter water, stop pump one bay leaf.
certain so it dissolve the stock pot in the water and then into the casserole pan, and if we cook slowly.
now for approx an hour, an hour fifteen in the oven.
but the one thing you 'll notice.
but we did everything in stages nice and slowly even when it comes to finish the cooking it 's nice and slowly in a low oven, that one forty.
for an hour, hour fifteen and if it needs another fifteen minutes, then give another fifty minutes never allow time to dictate, it 's time to finish the minutes which is good for about an hour.
fifteen , an hour, and a half and how he finishes.
we had some branch weed and some blanch carrots.
these are blanks for about twelve minutes, and to top it all delicious creamed.
mashed potato, if you want you could put some peas in perfect gently stir in the carrots and again.
there 's no recipes, what you want to put inside take out the bay leaf.
when you find it and root vegetables work very well with a shepherds pie with a cottage pie again.
this would feed a good six people.
the carrots in as you can see it 's not too well, it 's not too dry.
so we put the potato on it, does n't sync a lot of people tend to make the minced two wet.
i think a kilo meat to a half a liter of stock is a good balance.
OK , so nice easy way of doing this.
you could pipe it.
that 's our basic.
so now what we have to do is build it across it looks like a pipe little milk with a fork finish with a fork to a pattern of your choice, there 's your college pie.
i would say approx ten minutes maybe twelve.
maybe fifteen, depending on your oven.
but i 'm going to put this into another of about one eighteen fifteen minutes in the oven, not to brown very nice, beautiful.
so anything left to do.
now part for meat.
it is just painted in some clarified butter or little oil.
your choice, and then we have the traditional cottage pie.
