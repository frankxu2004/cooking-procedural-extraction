hi , welcome to today 's episode of in the kitchen, keeping it.
real , i 'm your host ariel and today.
we 're making sauerkraut and naturally fermented vegetable, that is, phenomenal for you.
the program equality through the roof when i say, sauerkraut, i meant to say carrot cumin coriander crowd so it 's quite special.
all we 're going to do is take one head of cabbage, which is gigantically large.
a few carrot sticks get some ground down our food processor with using the shred blade so you get a nice.
yeah , per vegetable, which will really help create a yummy brine, boo baby.
you look at so good you look at the right sauerkraut and or all fermented vegetables that are naturally fermented at home.
nice and wildly like we 're doing right now are so good for your digestion.
the natural probiotic content is something that traditional people for a long, long time, knew was good for them and always eight and it 's an amazing way of keeping your vegetables preserved for abzan ads in a day.
so do you see that this was started dry.
and you see how wet it is.
let me see if i squeeze it.
if we can see any water come out.
OK , do you see that, that water is going to turn into the brine that our crowd will soak in an become fermented.
so you 've got your crowd in there, your seeds are on top, so this is a nice clean pyrex filled with water.
and i 've got my plastic lid on there.
and what i 'm going to do is use this to push down my crowd OK what that 's going to do is make the water rise up.
and that 's what we want that liquid overtime in the crock covered is what 's going to keep the veggies growing.
the east end.
fermenting , you do n't need to fuss over it every day for five days minimum.
you 're going to check it and make sure that the water is coming to the surface.
if you need to push your thing down again to draw the water up.
and i 'll check in five days.
we 're back five days minimum later.
we 've got our crowd.
i can see all those seeds are in there, and you can smell, is all fermented would be perfect with some brought worst, yeah, and i 'm going to keep it in the fridge it will just get better with time, it is, good with every meal to have at least something fermented in old school times that there was like a no brainer in our culture in our country today, we do n't really do, that i do n't know too.
and a day ago it was like da, you always, that 's why i mean, that 's why wine is so common with generate.
that 's a fermented drink kimchi in asia, and crowd, and eastern europe, and hot sauce used to always be naturally fermented you could n't go to the supermarket and buy it, and so, yeah, with every meal.
you want to have about two tablespoons of something fermented.
it just super, super great for digestion and then when you 're done packing your crowd down, you can save the brian.
and for your.
next batch, if you wanted to add a little bit of juice and brian from your last one boom i 'm going to finish packing this guy down.
and then we 're going to try some.
so guys really special thing that happened when we got this all package down and ready to try one of my awesome film crew members of digital moon peter who is from the czech republic, got.
so animated about sauerkraut and started trying to tell me a story that i was like sap, come on , camera.
so you 're from the czech republic, you grew up eating this stuff.
tell me how did your family make crowd, you know, i was fortunately are doing something.
new SKS do, and all the sudden my grand father, you know, draw up the U haul full of cabbage and brother big park.
and we just started chopping it and grand in it.
and i had to just stand up in apart and you know, well, you use your feet.
oh , my gosh.
that 's old school.
that 's the way we used to do it.
that 's the way it used to be done.
and after that, my mom sent me to the basement and i just grab it with my hand.
while then, she put it on a stuff and cooked.
it was great wow.
i 'm terrified to have peter try this.
because it sounds like he 's got some real deal crowd history.
but let 's see what he thinks is that the is it.
