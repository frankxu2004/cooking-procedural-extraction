hi , everyone, welcome back today.
i 'm gonna show, you.
how to make this absolutely delicious tabbouleh, which is raw, vegan and low.
fat , it 's so yummy and just has so much flavor.
it 's a great dish to try, if you want to incorporate more raw food into your diet, you could serve this up as a meal by itself or you could have it as a side dish as well.
i hope that you guys enjoy this video and let 's get started.
so for this dish, you will need about one medium, sized cucumber.
you will need two large tomatoes about three fourths of a red onion, two cloves of garlic, you will also need about one cup of lemon juice and approximately half a cup of quinoa.
typically is traditionally made, using bulgur wheat, but i just prefer quinoa.
and i like that you can eat this raw by simply soaking it and sprouting it for a few hours, beforehand.
and of course for one of the main and most nutritious ingredients you will need about two bunches of fresh parsley, and here i have two different varieties.
i have the curly leaf parsley on the left and the flat leaf parsley on the right.
i personally enjoy mixing them.
but most people prefer it just to use the flat leaf parsley and for a nice sweet, little fresh touch, you will also need a few mint leaves, and if you want to serve these in cute little rock, taco shells you will also need a few romaine lettuce leaves.
so the first step is to go ahead and ice up your cucumbers , onions.
tomato and garlic and then pour all of those ingredients together in a big bowl.
make sure that it 's big because you 're going to be doing a lot of mixing and then go ahead and add your keen wah.
and your lemon juice.
so we 're going to give that a nice store.
and we 're just going to set that on this side, well, we prepare the parsley just going to allow time for all the flavors to mix together really nicely.
and the lemon juice will help to give the keen wah a really nice and soft and fluffy texture.
so go ahead and set that to the side, and we 're going to get started with the parsley.
so the first step is to separate the leaves from the stems.
this does take a little bit of time, but this is just a labor of love, because this herb is so good for you, and it taste really amazing.
so i do n't mind spending a few minutes doing this.
so you just want to continue this process until you 've separated all the leaves from the stems and eventually you 'll have a nice big bowl of all the parsley leaves, which will look something like this, and then you can go ahead and throw in your mint.
and i 'm just going to put this into a strainer and give it a nice wash just to get any leftover debris or dirt off the leaves, and then i 'm going to use this, rounded knife.
i believe it 's called an herb chopper.
but you could just use a regular knife as well.
i 'm going to take about a handful of the parsley put it on a wooden board and just go ahead and chop that up parsley is very rich in essential vitamins like vitamin C B, twelve K N, A which means it 's really great for our skin, plus it 's also a natural deodoriser inside, out and even though this does take a little bit of time it 's one of my favorite parts.
because it just makes the whole kitchen smell.
so good and also, i just kind of like doing things like this sometimes i just feel like it 's quite relaxing and calming almost, so, i do n't know thumbs up if you agree with me.
so , once you chopped up all the parsley it should look something like this.
next step is to go ahead and mix that in, with the dice, step vegetables in the key one lemon juice that we put aside earlier, just blend, blend, blend and of course, you can always alternate the quantities of the ingredients to suit your preference for final touches.
i 'm just adding in about half a cup of chopped peanuts, which i really love.
i went to placed, the keen wah with just pine nuts, and it tasted.
so good, but if you want to keep this on the low fat side, i recommend only adding about half a cup.
you could also go ahead and add a little bit of olive oil and salt and pepper.
but i think that this is just perfect on its own, because of all the flavors, but go ahead.
and tailor, it to your preference and now all that 's left to do is to serve this and eat it all up.
but this in some romaine lettuce leaves, which are just the perfect shape because they 're like little boats, and they hold the tabouli really.
well , so you could either set this out on the table for people to do by themselves, which i 'm sure kids would especially love or you can just go ahead and prepare a few and serve like.
so even if you 're not a raw vegan this is just a great recipe to have as a side dish.
and , for those of you who are raw vegan.
this just makes such a perfect dish to have, i love making a big batch of this for myself about once a week.
and it stays good for up to three or four days.
the longer you let it silk and all the juices the better it gets so i hope that you guys enjoy this video.
