sausages with onion gravy would have to be an absolute family classic.
it 's easy to do specially, get home late at night, and you just wanna get something on quick the secret to major successes.
your timing so happy potatoes, ready of the gravy.
we 're going to use.
is just a common variety off the shelf.
gravy , but to make it S really nice instead of using water, you some beef stock and that just gives it another local flavor.
i 've got the butter melted for my mashed potato when it happens.
you need an onion.
so step one a couple of highlights.
tron is because of the same size.
because they gonna cook at the same time, and i 'll just cut them into quarters.
now with the sausages get some really good quality ones.
these ones are angus plate and a paper, was sure, as so that 'll be good.
i print them.
but we 'll talk about that in mind.
let 's get out tires on.
first , so, grab ron always remember a cold war stock.
i never which squads in hot water, bugs out the starch, and you 'll end up ugly mess of the oral OK.
we got them on quality from hawaii.
maybe five penn rating i start on high heat first just give that a moment just along a little bit and then put the hate that it 's too hard.
and it 's going to be in the outside of the sausage, and it 's not quite through.
so i slowed.
is the better with snags also you probably split, the skins, which is not the little data it 's calling for their sausages and then we 'll just keep turning them to the cook through account, turn the heat down to medium amateur surveys quietly cause i probably take about ten or.
so minutes, to firstly?
OK , what are sausages are cooking, and fighters are cooking.
let 's get out onion ready to peel goes always run away broad.
best way to cut your onions is that way done so they 'll be ready to pop into the pan.
and we 're almost done.
macaso seed is a damn now what we 're gonna.
do is cooker onions in the pan and use all these delicious curries in flavors from sausages.
so when they get to take the snags out and put them to one side you want to keep them on signal to cover them in foil, will just pop them in the oven until already planning papa millions, not too much space?
and we 'll just for these ram and brown them to the nice and soft and this every, so often shaky potatoes to make sure they 're ready here.
if they already done the commission will check them out, OK, i mean saddam a beautiful caramelised now is good, is proper gravy?
yeah , and just do it until it begins.
she stand clutch now.
now that 's going to be just a little too thick.
so what i 'll do horse cave little bit of stock on hand and it just got a little bit thick on it, you can just pop some more in and just back it up a little bit that looks about right.
now will set this aside, mashed potatoes.
and we 're ready to put the meal together like appetite has done.
this thing that 's dryness and what we want to do is get sorry that all the moisture ever it 's pretty good.
but then skip the mesh.
now if you want to get really spectacularly good.
as i said you gotta, have your bottom with grab an egg?
get rid of the watch, just, well, we want to go drop that in butter in, and you 'll end up with a much more creamy luxurious result.
it 's an old trick.
the people doing the on the farms and in the country that most people forgotten now, but you can drop a maybe i can.
it makes all the difference remember that clips just fabulous.
navarrette ready to assemble, yeah.
