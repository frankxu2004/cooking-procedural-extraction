hey party people, it 's me DD, welcome back to cooking with DD.
i am so excited today is a great day.
we 're going to make my famous fried chick in an.
let me tell you this fried chikin is very easy to make it 's so simple.
however , it is so good.
that 's going to knock the socks off any when you make it for.
if you have a boyfriend, it 's going to make a put a ring, on it, or if you make it for your family, there going to be.
like , oh, my gosh.
this girl is just or boy.
i have to there to the boys out there who are cooking as well, it 's going to knock everyone socks off actually.
my son made this a couple weeks ago for some friends, they went to a party and he made it.
and they said it was the best chicken they 'd ever had.
is teach them.
how to cook, especially your boys because a lot of those girls are n't cooking these days.
so anyway, i 'm going to run through the ingredients were going to make this chick in and let 's go OK.
let 's run through the very easy ingredients.
you 're going to need about four pounds of chick in today.
i 'm using drumsticks, thighs and wings.
i have one pound of drumsticks one pound of thighs and about two pounds of wings, then i will need about one and a half to two cups of buttermilk, and this is three cups of flour.
i have garlic salt, black pepper, seasoning salt and paprika that 's it.
if you miss the ingredients, which i hope you did n't it so easy, i 'm going to show him to you now.
alright let 's season the chicken i usually start with my seasoning salts.
and this is all to taste.
i do n't really use measurements here.
so , i guess just try to follow along with how much i 'm putting in here.
so i just put a layer of seasoning salt over the top of the chick in an.
i 'm going to repeat this, a couple times.
i 'm also then going to add some pepper over the top and since you 're sticking this in oil, a lot of this kind of cooks off the chick in.
so feel free to be a little heavy handed on the seasoning.
then i have some garlic salts and again just delight layer an now.
i 'm adding some pep.
rica alright, now that the top layer is covered washed hands i 'm just going to run my hands through this and try to get the seasoning on all the chick in all right and.
now we 're going to add more seasoning just wipe off my hands here a little bit.
you do n't want the raw chicken on the seasoning bottle.
so i 'm going to repeat this time.
i 'm just going to start with the pep rica, then.
the garlic salt then the pepper, then the seasoning salt.
all right, so i 'm just going to run my hands through this again, make sure the seasoning covers all the chick in all the pieces here.
and you want to make sure before you start seasoning that your chicken is washed thoroughly.
i like to cut a little bit of the extra skin.
offen the fat alright so it looks like it 's season pretty well, the last step to this.
i take the chicken wing and i make it kind of one little piece.
i wrapped the leg behind the back part of the drum.
it that way when you 're frying it, it just stays kind of like one piece.
instead of like the wing and the everything flying all over the place, makes it easier to fry alright find all my wings in here.
now i did a little more wings than normal.
because my husband loves chicken wings.
alright almost finished here look for those wings that ones being a little testy alright looks like i got all the wings, and i tucked those little suckers back.
here 's one alright looks like we 're good to go.
all right now that you have the seasoning on it, like my hands off, you want to let the seasoning sit in for about.
i do n't know ten fifteen minutes prior to frying, and you also want to pour some buttermilk over the season chicken.
now the butter in the chick in when it fries, it 's going to make a big difference going to be.
so tender and juicy alright.
so this little bugger did n't want to stay back.
so again in the seasoning with the buttermilk.
you want to mix it around and make sure that every piece of chicken is soaking in that buttermilk there alright that looks pretty good and just going to wipe my hands and at this point you 're going to want to heat your oil , an.
i like to heat it to about three fifty three eighty, and right.
now i 'm going to start at about three sixty, and i 'm going to preheat the oil while all of the seasoning in the buttermilk soaks into the chick in an we will start frying probably in about ten minutes after the oil is, warm season OK, it 's been, about ten minutes are oil has been heating up an.
now it 's time to get the chicken ready to fry so, in a zip lock, baggie i have some flower what you want to do, i do n't know like five six seven eight pieces of chick in how many ever will fit into the bag i 'm going to do a combo of wings, legs, and thighs just kind of rolling the chicken around in the buttermilk here, here 's a nice little leg mean myself i like the thighs my daughter, likes the drumsticks, and my husband likes the wings.
so that 's why i choose these pieces of chick in that one came apart.
so i 'm not going to use that alright once you have a few pieces of chicken in here.
they 're going to want to seal it like so get the air out.
and then you 're going to want to shake it up.
make sure that flower covers all of the chicken in your bag.
if you just take it up just go back and forth upside down should cook the chicken wall with the flower.
now what you want to do is check and make sure that your oil is hot enough.
i like the temperature to be about three sixty.
so , you know, when your oil is ready, if you insert the end of a wooden spoon, and it starts to sizzle, let 's check it out.
see if it 's ready wooden spoon into the oil.
oh , yeah, there we go starts to sizzle your oil is ready.
the temperature of the oil is very important in frying chicken.
it has to be hot enough, but not too hot, so that it burns a chick in right now.
we 're at three hundred and sixty degrees.
so the chicken that i put into the flower i 'm now going to transfer from my bag into the pan who look at that sizzle right away.
you do n't want to burn yourself the secret to great chick in is making sure that you turn it frequently.
that gets the ultimate christmas and color on the chickens, you 'll see this is already turning a little bit brown.
honestly you 're going to turn this chick in over probably about twenty times before you 're finished with the chick in, well, this is browning on this side.
i 'm going to go ahead and add some more chick in to my flour mixture over here it smells so good number.
that 's prepared with paper towel.
so what you wanna do kind of shake that grease off of there and stick it on your pan to drain the excess oil.
see the wings are nice and golden, brown and very crispy.
so we 're almost finished.
i just wanted to show you what your chicken should look like as it 's coming out at this excess oil.
come on, stick it on your prepared pan.
nice and golden and crispy.
what it should look like.
