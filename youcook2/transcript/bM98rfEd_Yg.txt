hi , every wine i like california rolls.
because it 's tasty and healthy every.
now and then i like to do DIY kelly rolls.
because all i have to do is a little prep and everyone can assemble their own.
it 's great for summer, get togethers or whenever you feel lazy.
but one a light and healthy meal just be sure to serve it with hot rice and meso soup.
so let 's get started.
start by dry roasting, unseasoned, nori sheets in a pan over medium high heat.
it 's toasted when it turns to either a light fluorescent, green or reddish in color, then cut into force now prep the imitation crab.
mine comes in long states, you can use to sticks as is.
but i like to flake it into strips.
because it gives a better mouth, feel like biting into layers of acausal, then cut into the same length as tanori traditionally mannys is mixed with the imitation crab to impart creaminess and to keep it together, however, i like mine plain.
but at a generous amount of avocado later, instead.
now onto the vegetables.
i know it 's common sense to wash them well, prepped.
the radish sprouts by cutting at the base of the stem then cut the cucumbers and too long thin diagonals.
so he saw some wishabi as he must, for california rolls to assemble at hot rice onto dhanori add all the prepped ingredients in top with masago and spoon on some soy sauce and wassabi, slurry things for watching happy days.
