welcome to japanese.
cooking one, oh one today.
we 're gonna make california roll to make california roll, or any sushi.
we need sushi rice, which is quite easy to make you can see our sushi rice recipe and a how to video on japanese, cooking one, oh, one dot com.
let 's take a look at the ingredients we have one recipe of sushi rice two sheets of roasted seaweed or sushi nollie in japanese cutting to have one can of crap me lightly seasoned with lemon juice and salt one avocado cut into sticks.
one cucumber cut into sticks and some roasted white sesame E seeds to make a roll.
you need a bamboo rolling mat called mikisew.
we put a plastic wrap on top of the bamboo mat.
an place a seaweed, this is a half a size of a regular side seat, then spread some rice on top.
you should wet your hands to do that.
so the rice wo n't get stuck on your fingers spread the rice on the seaweed by pushing it down lightly.
but not, too hard.
you can find this bamboo rolling mat at asian grocery stores, if you have one nearby or you can order one online, and sprinkle.
some toasted white sesame E seeds on top.
a price now lift one side up and flip it over rice side down on the plastic wrap.
now put some craft meat mixture horizontally on one side of the seaweed, giving about a one inch space from the end.
it 's quite not in the middle, but let 's say about a third of the way closer to your side.
and some cucumber sticks and avocado, once everything gets placed on top of the seaweed grab, a bamboo mat an roll it up just like a jelly roll cake.
first , you roll to cover the fillings with the rice and CV squeezed, lightly and rolled the rest of the way just like that and squeeze again.
after you finish rolling all the way, and maybe one more time to roll a little bit further and squeeze one last time.
it does n't look.
so bad, do n't worry if you make a mistake and get messy you will get used to it fairly quickly and remove it from the plastic wrap and cut it into six to eight?
it 's not that hard is it california roll, she.
