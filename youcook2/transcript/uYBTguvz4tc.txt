and why, why is this a favorite comfort.
so this is at my dad love to cook for us my dad passed away about three years.
but he loves to cook, and this is one of his favorite meals to make especially when my sister and i were living in california.
we would come all the way across the country, come home.
there 's my dad with my husband.
david that was at our wedding shower in.
atlanta , which is where he brought us a copy of the new york times cookbook and that for him that recipe, in the book was always the basis for his beef.
burgundy errors, he preferred to say both bugging yawn, because he like to say it in french.
there is cooking in my, in my kitchen in san francisco.
the red cabinets, so in honor of my JAD, both bourguignon.
this morning, winter meal good winter party, and you are you friendly, active.
some french in me, and i do speak french and my sister lives in france very, well.
so we have a big love for all things french in my family.
places got french wine.
so you ca n't go which is why we 're each starting out with a glass of wine.
because my dad would also recommend perhaps having a glass of something as you 're cooking.
it should certainly.
ca n't hear them from max there.
we go so, something as we would say in france, first.
i want to start with your meets.
the first thing that you 're going to do tom.
sorry , i 'm giving you the wine to make you put it down.
you want, you want to solve right on both sides and one little trick.
i learned from our good friend, bobby flay.
do it by pi?
you want to get high when you felt it to your salt and pepper.
this liberally, you would do it on both sides in the interest of time on television.
then you take it, you 're going to put it in a bag with about a third of a cup of flaps.
huber , a bunch i would have been several at a time.
otherwise it would take you all day to get him in there.
what you 're going to do is shake it around.
coat them really well.
and then what you would do what lectures already involved in over here.
have been doing?
we looked a little bit of bacon in the pan and one of my well loved red flag actually take the bacon out in that bacon grease, where the little extra olive oil you start browning the meat so.
we 've got some brown here so let 's for once it gets around.
you want to start to take it out.
so we 'll take it out, and put it and put it in here and you want to try to leave some of the juice in here as you take the meat out and that 's.
because we 're going to use that to get a little bit more flavor from the, from the rest of this.
i 'm just moving in here my current area.
please give them too slow.
i do n't know.
i hear wherever how things work on television.
twenty minutes late have a lot of time so we take all the meat out.
and then you 're going to take some brandy here.
OK , almost this goes into the pot and you 're going to deglaze the pot, supporting kind of slowly, and then the whole time, the brand is in there you just want to scrape up.
those yummy brown.
and , so this will take you a couple of minutes, and this will actually turn into a nice, lovely, sort of creamy, concoction in all these bits together.
little bit apologetic.
it 's going to burn off a little bit, yeah, so what we would do then.
is we put some make some of that, in with the meat.
but we 're going to do.
now is an then what would be left in the pan did kind of cleanup analytic, modify it for TV?
add some butter and olive oil.
we 've got onions and carrots, well.
let 's put it all in what is it.
tomato paste tomato pieces, coming after so we 're going to put our vegetables for a little bit.
then you would add in the tomato paste leeks and garlic leeks and garlic, you 're going to cook it all down, till it 's really soft, then we would put the meat and the bacon back end along with a number of different herbs and spices.
so we had.
i used ground cloves.
bay leaves a lot of time a lot of parsley, then we would put it out of obama, the wine put in beef stock.
yes , but, you know, we 're actually going to move down here in the interest of time.
so we put all these things in cooking for twenty minutes, throw in the oven for about an hour.
you saute some onions and some mushroom.
stealing we throw those mushrooms in adam in at the end, give it a good mix.
i 'm going to steal this spoon, and voila you have beef.
it 's a party.
it 's a very pretty meal and one of the best things you can do is make it ahead.
i actually made mine on tuesday.
i froze it for friends were coming over for dinner.
tonight freezes beautifully supposed to show up for that if you could be there around six because my kids have to go to bed early last week.
so we 're going to take a test and just to let, you know, you can find the recipes on line along with a little bit more about my awesome dad speed at today dot com, up next.
