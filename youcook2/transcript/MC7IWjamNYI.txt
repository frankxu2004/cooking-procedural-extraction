hey , everybody is rosie, and in this video, i want to share my recipe for my cheddar, garlic mashed potatoes.
so i 'm starting off with my peeled and chopped russet potatoes.
i have them in a large part and now i am going to pour in some cold water.
we want enough water to cover all of our potatoes.
so now i 'm going to bring my water to a boil, an we want it, well, are potatoes until they are fork?
tender schreiner potatoes, and set them aside.
my next step will be melting down two to three tablespoons of salted butter, and i 'm going to add in one half teaspoon of minced garlic.
so at this time, my heat is on medium and.
now i 'm going to add in all of my potatoes.
next we 're going to mash potatoes until we can get as many lumps out as possible.
if you like lumpy mashed potatoes, child, you are truly different.
our next step will be adding in half and half.
if you 've been using milk, your whole life, and you do n't want to use half and half or you do n't have half and half on hand, go ahead and just use regular milk.
i love to taste of half and half with my mashed potatoes so that 's what i 'm using.
see i 'm adding a little bit more.
i just want to make sure my potatoes are nice and creamy.
so now i 'm going to add in some salt in a little bit of ground, black pepper followed by some shredded sharp cheddar cheese.
so now let 's just take a kitchen utensil.
and we want to make sure everything is nicely folded so we do n't just have the cheese on top of the potatoes.
and , once the cheese starts to melt, it 's going to look nice and delicious and creamy.
just like this and baby, we are ready to serve.
