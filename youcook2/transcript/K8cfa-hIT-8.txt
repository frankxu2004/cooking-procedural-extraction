no , hi, this is sister to funky coming to you live at cafe seven, oh, at the museum of uncut funk today.
i 'm going to prepare for you.
my version of boudin, noodle soup, so what i have here before me are my ingredients.
i have one sliced carrot and what i have.
here are broccoli leaf.
stems now views the leaves for another recipe.
but i 've always saved my broccoli stems.
because they 're filled with a lot of nutrients and why throw them out when you could use them for stews and soups and flavor vote to whatever dish that you 're cooking.
i have here a sliced red pepper.
some chop shit talky mushrooms mike who don noodles, i have a tablespoon of ginger, an four garlic cloves.
i also have a roasted turkey breast that i have sliced and i 'm going to add to my soup, and for my base, the flavoring, i 'm going to use a chicken stuff towards the end of my meal when i place it in the bowl i 'm going to chat scallions and put them on top.
and i have here some low sodium soy sauce just to add more flavoring.
so what i 'm going to do is put my base in a pot of boiling water.
then , i 'm going to start to add my ingredients OK.
i have my pot of boiling water.
i 'm going to add two packets of chicken stock to my water, an i actually have in here four cups of water, and i 'm adding two packets of chicken stock now, while that is boiling and the chicken starts, starts to dissolve.
i 'm going to add my four shop.
karlik garlic cloves and my one tablespoon of ginger.
i 'm going to mix that around, OK.
now i 'm going to start to add my vegetables to this mixture.
because i 'm not going to let them cook very long they 're going to cook for about two to three minutes.
i want them to be fork tender, but i do n't want them to be mushy.
so i 'm going to take my carrots, and i 'm going to add those into this mix going to take my broccoli.
leaf stems and i 'm going to add that going to mix this around from there.
i 'm going to add my red pepper sliced bread, pepper.
an my chuck shit talking mushrooms.
OK , now i 'm going to put a cover on this.
let this come to a boil and come back in two to three minutes.
and now that i have all of my vegetables in the pot, i 'm going to let this boil for about a minute or two again.
i want my vegetables to be fork tender, and i 'm going to get a cover.
let this boil, and then when i come back, i 'm going to add my noodles an my roasted turkey and let that get warmed in the broth with the vegetables and will have lunch.
OK , so our soup has been boiling for about two minutes, and i want to take the cover off.
i 'm going to reduce the heat under there.
so it could be atomize simmer now, what i 'm getting ready to do.
is i 'm going to add my boudin noodles to this mixture?
just put him in just like that now, once the noodles go, in this is not going to take long to cook.
because the noodles are already cooked for you.
so basically you 're just warming them up in your stock and vegetables.
so i 'm going to mix the vegetables around, make sure the noodles get covered with the bra, and then i 'm going to take my slice, roasted turkey, and i 'm going to place that right on top like this and allow the turkey to get warm.
you can push some of those pieces down like that, and you can add more turkey or less turkey more vegetables less vegetables whatever you choose to do.
so i 'm going to let this simmer for about another minute.
and then when we come back, i 'm going to put some in a bowl.
and we 're going to have.
lunch , boudin, noodle soup, for lunch today.
OK , our soup has been simmering, i 'm going to turn this out and as you can see it 's nice and hot.
so i am going to take my tongues and put some of these noodles mix this up a little bit.
put some of these noodles in my bowl, be very careful taking.
this out because, you know, they 're thick noodles and you want to be able to get everything in the bowl.
so i got my noodles in the bowl, i mean, get some vegetables.
some of the carrots.
some of the broccoli stems and some of the mushrooms in all their goodness in here and put some of the roasted turkey right on top.
and then i 'm going to get my ladle and make sure i get some of the broth in here.
and when you getting the broth and also scoop up some of those vegetables that are on the side fantastic, you know, if i did n't mention it before you can get good on noodles from your local asian supermarket if you have one in your community.
so as i 've got my soup in here i 'm going to come over here and get some of these scallions and sprinkled on right on top.
let me cover my soup to make sure it stays nice and warm.
and i have my spoon here.
now you can add a little soy sauce on top of this, if you 'd like it 's not necessary.
i personally think there 's enough flavor going on in here where i for myself will not add any soy sauce.
so i 'm going to taste this broad.
you get the hint of the shit, talking mushrooms.
you can taste the ginger garlic and this is just really a really good light and easy to make anytime of the year.
so i hope you try this recipe.
i 'm going to finish having my lunch here.
an i 'll see you next time.
