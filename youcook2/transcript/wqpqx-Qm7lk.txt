OK , for those of you who asked and for my kids here, it is preheat your oven to three fifty, and then go start chopping your garlic and your onions.
if you 're going to add them now, if you have, finicky children, like mine were, they may not like onion and garlic.
so you can just leave this first two steps out, if you wish.
but i decided to trick my children, and i started adding to the little bit of onion in a little bit of garlic, out of time, and i chopped it up very, very good, the smaller it is the less likely to notice it.
but they will notice the flavor and just think it 's yummy.
so i just chop and, chop, and chop until i feel like i just ca n't chop anymore, and as you 'll see these pieces are very, very tiny.
next step is the eggs and i like to use eggs from free roaming hens, and i, gotta, tell you one time, my daughter.
and i were in the grocery store in the produce section.
and we were n't sure where the eggs were, so he asked the produce man, we said do you have any free roaming eggs.
an he was standing next to a cooler any and he put his arms, he stretched his arms out and put it around the cooler he said, no.
i do n't have any free roaming eggs.
he said i make all my eggs.
stay right here.
it was hilarious, and we laughed about that time.
oh , yeah, you just saw me sniff those eggs.
i like to smell my eggs to make sure their fresh before adam to my meatloaf.
so just beat him up.
and then take a pack of crackers, you know, the kind of talking about those kind that are very good for you and just smash him up.
really , really good, while they 're in the package in that way you do n't have much of a mess, you know.
because all the crumbs stay right inside there.
i like to get these really, really small.
because when you get a big piece of cracker and you meatloaf it just is n't good.
so make him really, really tiny smoochum, good.
next is your tomato sauce.
i do n't have a special preference.
i like to use the lean stuff.
and there 's less grease in there, you know.
and it 's better and healthier for you and i use about a half a can of the tomato sauce in the burger.
the cold burger, make sure that burgers cold an A one sauce probably about two tablespoons.
i just eyeball it the same with what 's this year sauce about two tablespoons.
i guess just, you know, sprinkle it over the top.
but the trick is to a good meatloaf that melds together and holds together and does n't fall apart.
is the meat must be cold?
yeah , add some of this catch up in here.
now all these liquidy items they 're going to help your meatloaf hold together.
and your onions in your garlic put that in there if you 're going to.
and you 're free roaming eggs.
and of course, the crackers and you pour the crackers in now you 're going to mix this up.
you 're not going to mix too long.
that 's the key to, if you overwork the meatloaf, it 's going to get warm from your hands, and it will fall apart when you cut it.
so , so a little bit of garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste then if you 're superstitious like i am.
but have a bad memory, and you spill the salt.
i just pick a little up and throw a little over each shoulder 'cause i could never remember which shoulder to throw it over.
so anyway, mix your meatloaf and like i said, do n't play around in there, too long, just to get it.
so that all the crackers are wet an mixed in there real good and then shape it up and put it in the pan.
just think patty cake, OK, when i 'm shaping the meatloaf into the pan i like to make a little.
well , i press down with my hands to make a little well, on the top of the meatloaf for later.
OK , so now it 's time to put your meatloaf in the oven, and i like to cover a cookie sheet with aluminum.
foil that way if there 's any grease splatters, it 'll make for easier cleanup later.
and less chance for a fire.
so we set our timer to forty five minutes, and then we go on an prepare, the rest of our meal while we 're waiting for meatloaf to cook and today we 're going to have dollies famous potato pancakes, OK, some yummy garlic and onions chopped ann lawry salt and then we 're going to put in some james crazy, mixed up salt.
i do n't know if you can get this in your town.
because when i first moved to florida i had to talk my grocery end of ordering this for me.
we have n't in ohio.
but one, seven years ago, when i came to florida they did n't have it.
but this is it an essential ingredient for potato pancakes, and of course more garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste and the key again.
folks is cold potatoes very cold that holds them together when they 're cooking and they wo n't fall apart on you OK.
but again, your potatoes must be very cold.
so if you have leftover mashed potatoes from last night 's meal get him out, and make some potato pancakes with them.
do n't mess around?
in there, too, long.
just like with the meatloaf, hurry up and make your patties and remember the temperature of your oil is very important.
and i like to use extra virgin.
olive oil, just like rachel ray gotta have something healthy going on in this meal and like i said, the temperature is very important.
i try to cook mine medium heat OK.
so i just take a little bit of the potato.
the cold potato.
and i put.
it , in the pan, and when that starts sizzling, i know that pan is ready for my potato pancake and.
now when i start to see little crispy things growing around the outer part of the potato pancake.
i know it 's time to flip it, so be careful at this part that you do n't get that hot oil on you as it will hurt.
i just flip it over an lucky there.
nice golden brown potato pancakes, i love him there so yummy.
it 's important to cook your potato pancakes in a teflon pan and my daughter only has a small teflon pan.
so i have to cook one at a time and i like frozen corn or fresh corn.
i do n't really care for can stuff, so i 'm heating up some of that, as well.
all right now when your buzzer rings at forty five minutes then take your meatloaf out and pour.
the , the other half of that tomato sauce that you saved or that over the top and cook it for another fifteen minutes and voila, we have home-cooked comfort food do n't want to eat this very often.
because it really is n't that healthy for you.
but it sure is good and it is comforting now.
watch how this stays together as i slice it, and serve it on the plate.
it 's all because it was cold when i started.
i 'm starving, let 's go eat.
