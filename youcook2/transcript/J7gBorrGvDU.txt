everyone i 'm durando with foods, one, oh one.
today , i 'm going to show you how to make these crispy fried beer, battered onion rings and let me tell you there, absolutely fantastic and very addictive.
now i 'm using the videl, ya onions right now.
there are abundant in the grocery store this time of the year, and you 're going to use about this size of an onion.
you 're going to slice the ends all pill off the first layer into about one fourth to a half, an inch and slices once you get your slices, cut you 're going to pull him apart into these rings, and of course, the closer you get to this center of your sliced onion the smaller your onion ring is going to become.
i 've got one cup of flour.
three force of a cup of cornstarch, one teaspoon of pepper rica.
this is the smoky hungarian pepper rica.
and let me tell you folks, when you bite into this onion ring, using this smokey.
pepper rica, you 're going to get up.
they are absolutely delicious.
i 've got one teaspoon of baking powder one half teaspoon of kosher, saw one fourth teaspoon of fresh cracked pepper, and i 've got one bottle, a twelve ounce bottle of chilled beer.
now i 'm using the rolling rock today.
but if you want to use a logger or whatever you have, on hand that 's great just make sure you 've got about twelve answers a chilled beer , now.
let me show you how to get this together to the flower.
you 're going to add your baking powder.
we 're going to add your salt pepper.
rica and pepper using a whisk, you, wanna incorporate these five ingredients well, together.
next , we 're going to add the beer slowly, add your beer.
make sure it 's chilled.
it 's very important that it 's chilled.
oh , yeah, smells yummy, but these onions and this fabulous batter and over here on the stove i have three cups of vegetable oil heating on medium heat.
you want your oil about three hundred and fifty degrees fahrenheit, and now we 're going to take the cornstarch, added in there and give it a whisk.
this is what 's going to give that onion ring an extra crunch of crispiness now that your onion ring batter is well combined.
you 're going to add about a third of your onions, using a skewer.
i 'm going to go ahead and toss these around, so come on over here to the stove top.
and i 'll show you how to get these frying.
i 've got my oil heating on medium heat.
you do n't want to heat your oil.
any higher than that, a good five to eight minutes to heat it would be good but to test to make sure the oils ready.
i 'm going to drop a piece of bread in there, if it sizzles which it is.
then it 's time for the onion rings.
so i 'm going to go ahead and get this out.
and i 'm going to add the onion rings.
i find that it 's best to add the onion rings with a skewer.
that way you can shake off the excess batter on your onion and go ahead and drop it right into the oil.
and we 're going to fry this about a minute to a minute and a half on each side of the onion rings, be sure not to overcrowd your pan.
they are beginning to sizzle and smell so delicious.
the onion rings have been frying for about three and a half minutes, and i 'd like to add a little bit more batter to the onion rings.
so what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to shake my other onion rings in a little flower.
i 'm going to cut the onions before i put it in the batter now back over here in the back.
i 've lined cookie sheet with about three layers of paper towels, and i 'm going to drain my onion rings on them now as you can see.
i 've added a little flower to a plastic bag going to add few in my onion rings in there.
give him a nice little shape.
before i add it into the batter, my onion rings are holding just a little bit more better on him, an in the hot oil they go and again.
these are going to fry anywhere from three to four minutes.
that means about one and a half to two minutes on each side before we turn him.
these have been frying for about four minutes, and i love the thickness of the batter now absolutely going to be yummy and delicious.
so we 're going to liam over here.
let him during an as soon as you get him out of the oil what you 're going to do is you 're going to add a little kosher salt to the top.
because if you let him cool that salt is not going to stick to those onion rings here 's our crispy fried beer, battered onion rings.
i ca n't wait to try one taste like wow crunchy delicious.
sweet onion fried perfectly golden little him about hungarian pepper rica is coming through from that cornstarch gives it this extra delicious crunch.
you wo n't be disappointed hope.
