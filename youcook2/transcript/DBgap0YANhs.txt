beriani , becaus, the ingredient list, is so long?
what i do is.
i just block all these ingredients into one big.
bowl , and marinate the vegetables so first.
let 's get the vegetables in this bowl.
now i 'm going to add the yogurt.
the fresh cream, the cheese.
then the mint of course the most important ingredient, nice freshly chopped coriander which gives all the freshness butter teaspoon of healthy or turmeric one teaspoon of chili powder, two teaspoons of dana jira powder about one teaspoon to one and a half teaspoons of biryani, masala, some salt to taste, and of course, the tomatoes.
so now i 'm going to simply mix all these ingredients.
so that they mix and blend, well.
now last at the potatoes.
because we do n't want them to get too soggy anna bit of the onions.
maybe a tablespoon, or so OK so really, there are two ways of doing this beriani.
you can just layer these vegetables as is inaport, orapin that you 're making your biryani in, and then just layer the rise over it and let cook covered for about thirty to forty minutes on a low flame.
so you do n't have to wait and watch.
and you can simple wine while the bill ronnie is working.
just remember to place the pan underneath the cooking part.
so that the heat distributes evenly throughout so.

so now i 'm going to let these vegetables cook for a good five to six minutes, till all the flavors blend in while i prepare the rice for it.
you 're i have some salted cooked rice and in that, i put some saffron.

so that the color and the flavor spreads, evenly.
so your, i have the rice and to this, i 'm going to add some fried onions and just mix it nicely, and remember to flavor it with some salt at this point in time otherwise the beriani can get quite bland.
so now my vegetables are almost cooked here.
it does n't take much time because we already parboiled.
vegetables , before so, now, this spread it evenly in a leo just reduce the temperature to low.
and now i 'm going to simply layer the rice on top so it 's got all the goodness of vegetables you can add for cottage cheese.
you can add some chick in, i mean, whatever you like.

so why we add it right.
now the rice soaps and all the sweetness and gives it a really rich and decadent taste later on and the fried onion, and.
now i 'm going to place of foil or any type container or something on top.
