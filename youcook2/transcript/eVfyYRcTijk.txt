so it 's four thirty in the morning here in casco bay.
the suns just picking up over the atlantic ocean is absolutely beautiful.
and i 'm really excited to see what 's in store for us today on the fishing boat captain.
jim and his first made andy had been fishing mains.
casco bay, their whole lives.
they 're taking me out to one of their favorite fishing spots a couple hours off the coast where they think we can find some great fish for my recipe.
well , it 's about six AM and were steaming out into the gulf of maine.
we 're headed to the fishing grounds with a great group of hardy souls and run offshore about fifty miles today.
we 're going to get you guys on some awesome bottom.
some of my favorite fishing grounds OK bai ling, ling here.
let me give you just a little bit of a fishing lessons put a rod belt on.
and that 's going to save your hip feel a bump of the way to the jig slack.
so we 're just looking for that slack, and then pulling back up their secret spot is.
so packed with fish.
and he caught one literally thirty seconds into the day.
what do you want to do?
you want to pull the hooked up off blowfish on that rice.
hey , in about give me, kiss man.
why not first one baby that 's a fine looking ca n't do that to make a nice dinner to be some good eating nice fish and chips.
right now, can i get some more let 's get going over in the box?
you 're number one and our lock did n't stop there.
the fish were almost jumping into the boat feels good to be checking him loads out there brother, i mean, every time i catch one of these it 's like ten minutes or reeling, i mean, we 're coming from about four hundred feet.
so it 's a long fight.
this job bishop, really in card is one thing, but nothing could have prepared me for what was next year.
we got a shock on steel up my relax guys real.
get him up and get him up.
alright barn, two hands.
now i got a lot of drag on that cool hand, high up on the rod.
this is, this is intense shark fishing, is no joke?
it feels like i have a truck attached the end of this line.
you 're in for a hell of a fight here on that.
this ai n't coming in early, giving up a little bit, getting up now is that starting over starboard we want to keep it right off.
today is off, i think we dropped it.
jim , drop some alright will get another one that 's why they call it fishing and not catching.
right , well, we may have lost a sharp, but we have plenty of card for my next recipe.
all right, this is so why are n't you have fun fishing with this out in the gulf of maine today.
i had a blast.
we got some nice table fish ca n't wait to cook him up card cast.
those are beautiful fry fish, well, we got some fishing here for the crew, and i too was great to him.
so much, captain.
thank you very much.
i caught some beautiful cotton.
casco bay, with captain jim and his first made andy, and i 'm really excited about this guy up.
so the base of tartar sauce is really just this many 's just going to bind all the ingredients together here have some chopped cornerstones, has a nice briny flavor capers?
some shallots to add some parsley that 's good just a rough chop, right into the bowl to grab some taragon, and this is going to bring this licorice, flavored you 're not going to find terra gone in your traditional charter sauce.
but i just really enjoy it now.
i 'm going to add a squeeze of lemon just a tiny bit assault answer black pepper that looks good.
same go perfect with my fish set, this guys side, and now i 'm going to start on my chips grab a few potatoes.
so this is the japanese mandolin, but really it 's just a set blade, so we 're just going to slide the potato back and forth really consistent motion.
it 's a really essential tool to getting these really thin consistent slices, you know, you 're not putting too much pressure on this, you want the blade to do all the work you can get pretty close.
but i like to keep it safe just throw away this study, or you can use it in a stock or a soup.
but i do n't want to rest my fingers start new potato that should be good right there.
now i 'm going to soak them in water just to get rid of some of that starch so they do n't stick together as they fry.
so , i put this paper towel down 'cause.
i want to block some of the excess water off of these chips.
'cause you never want to add water to a hot pot oil alright.
now i 'm gonna start, frying my potato chips, but before that i want to check the temperature, have this handy dandy infrared thermometer about three fifty is good?
it 's good to keep these potato chips moving around.
you do n't want any hot spots in your oil, and you 'll start to tell when they 're done 'cause they 'll get really nice.
golden brown going to strain this, an blot it off on a paper towel get rid of any excess oil people.
these last ones out now going to chop up some herbs and toss it in with the potato chips is given a nice aroma, limited parsley.
some big time and this is just going to give a little color to the potatoes.
nice aromatic, herbaceous flavor tassies served in there.
add a little bit of salt.
give it a quick toss.
and some cracked black pepper alright.
these are done now.
i 'm going to move on to my batter for the fish, we might still out pop this guy open want to crack an egg is just going to help bind the whole batter.
just a little bit of stella.
we 're going to start with just a small amount of liquid and the carbonation is really just going to lighten the batter yielding a really crispy fish with that up, and add a little bit of flower at a time.
make sure it does n't clump up.
so you want to add this in small portions.
just keep repeating this process.
really this is just going to be very reminiscent of a pancake batter.
you want this just to coat the back of a spoon.
i 'm just going to put a little bit of salt in here.
and , that is looking good.
and now i 'm going to get on to the fish.
we caught some of these guys out in casco bay, nice and fresh probably quarter.
this , and this nice trips like that i want to cut this other guy right in half is just go straight into the batter.
so these are just lightly coded so the important thing when trying this fish is at the temperature of the oil has to be just right.
'cause you want the batter cooked a nice and golden brown.
but you also want the fish all the way through we will take about five to seven minutes there.
really you 're going to know that they 're done when the outside just gets nice, and golden, brown.
these look just absolutely fantastic.
he 's over here.
lot any excess oil off you do n't want to be too greasy little bit of salt.
when they come out how to play this just a handful of these seasoned chips.
nice stack, she is a good serving size.
and of course, my charter sauce now just go right in the basket.
now i have a taste fish is cooked perfectly and the batter is just really nice, thin and crispy when it takes one of these chips, too great.
fried foods are really salty.
and fatty so it 's nice to have the cedars.
crisp apple notes to balance it all out.
thank you so much for watching.
hopefully enjoyed my take on this classic dish, join me next week as a head down to hampton, new hampshire to check out their seafood festival.
