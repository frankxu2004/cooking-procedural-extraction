hey there welcome back everybody.
we did our fettuccine alfredo that was quickly devoured by my onsite guests.
mattanur , on our floor guys here at monadnock flooring and.
now we 're going to be making is ella vodka again, another simple dish and will go over and say hi to the guys go ahead , guys.
you have to tell everybody that we did n't just eat that no everybody.
no , it went pretty quick well, next dish is something that we make at the restaurant a lot.
but again, it 's one of those things people go how do you make it.
can i do that at home, and that 's what we 're going to do is penela vodka and luckily i found some absolute citron, which i do n't know where that came from?
but we found some absolute citron to make this with so.
let 's get back to our pen and get cooking little olive oil and heating the pan on medium high.
we 're going to add our punch.
it that first its most.
important ingredient punch.
it does a cured bacon from italy is basically or it could be made the united states.
but basically, what they do is they take the same items like a bacon or take the same thing like a bacon and cure it in salt where bacon is sometimes smoked.
this pancetta is cured insult.
you could actually looks great and people always cringe at this.
but i 'm telling you about it.
take sliced pancetta a little bit of tomato lettuce extra virgin olive oil on a sandwich.
it 's phenomenal, so if you like it 's a italian version of a BLT.
but you do n't even have to cook it what we 're doing is rendering some of the fat out of the punch.
it there, which is mostly fetches like bacon is, and we want to add that to the flavor of what we 're going to be making as far as the penela vodka.
so we get that cooking.
we 're going to go over here.
we 're going to get our roasted garlic and add that to it.
now , however, you like your punch at that to be rendered down some people really.
like it crispy like you do bacon they like that real crispiness.
i 'd like to get a little, little chewiness from it 'cause it 's going to cook a little bit more as we go.
now , the other thing that we 're going to do what you need to know about it sometimes people say to me, well, i ca n't find pancetta right.
you say that guys i ca n't find my check.
thanks , so it ca n't find punch it, but what do i use, well do n't use bacon like that smokey flavor.
what you want to use is pro shoot though, or pancetta.
those are more similar.
but they 're both cured items and they both work the same way, so we have shallots added to the dish again.
i love shout.
we 're going to do is take this away.
this is a little bit to add some of our vodka and we 're going to just bring that back.
we do n't want to get any claim.
oh , look at that i was wrong.
what do you do it at home and basically you do n't want to do that?
when you 're at home unless you know, what you 're looking for what i 'm doing, is from bang and here 's the thing?
flambe how important is it to the dish little bit.
what you want to do is cook off some of that bitterness, that alcohol has right off at the top and buy from being your helping that evaporate.
now when you 're doing it.
my recommendation is pulled away from the stove and get it back on as evenly as possible.
when you put it until to just a little bit the fat molecules pop up with the vapor spray and the alcohol is kind of pulled up with it and pow that 's where we have that excitement.
it looks great for camera though.
and nothing went off the beautiful thing that 's our little test to see if we 're going to turn on any alarms here from there.
we 're going to add a little bit of money.
not assaults, i pre make my money.
not a sauce of course, they may i like making my own.
but if you wanted to use a sauce that you pre by that 's fine also, i 'm going to let that cook in there.
so we have shallots.
you need to season.
we did n't season till this point will get a little seasoning in there.
i will let that cook down a little bit.
what do you think i so far smells great players really easy right, i mean, we really did n't do too much again?
it 's in one pan.
this will be enough for two, and then i 'm going to head our cream or magic cream.
that 's the magic part of the whole show is how it really brings together some all these flavors around it before we made a straight cream sauce and that straight cream sauce was the alfredo.
and now we 're going to use it in our penela vodka to just breakdown all the other strong flavors of pancetta strong.
the shouts are showing the gods are strong.
and then that you got this great tomato.
and now you 're just going to bring it all together with the, with the cream.
so now we 're just going to kind of move that around, in the pen, and let that come together and get our pasta ready and come back over and talk to the guys here.
and we also have a bottle of wine were going to drink with this segment.
why not, you know, can have pasta without wine, right correct can have vodka and pasta without wine.
it 's all about that, so this is a bottle of rosa V channel, which is a blended sanjo.
visit an multiple channel.
these two grapes work, well together the multiple channel, what you 're going to have on it is initially, it 's going to have that nice, nice big, big mouth, feel , right.
and then afterwards it 's going to go smooth that sounds of, is, is a smoother great?
that 's our wine segment of the day.
and we 're learning a little bit about everything here.
so you guys usually drink wine, or with your pasta or was going to ask why red, why red with pasta for me.
it 's red with cream, anything that 's heavy and rich, and has this really big body to it, whether it 's pasta whether it 's even a fish.
if i 'm doing a cream sauce around fish, sometimes i like nice smooth red wine.
so , that is a great question, too.
enjoy that, could you pass coming up soon, and in less time than it takes open a bottle of wine we started getting an ice cream.
so look at that.
as i moved away from the pan see how at least a little bit it 's like parting the pen advocacy.
so let 's turn this down, and as i did before that was good.
i come up with these on the fly as i did before what i 'm doing.
is incorporating the pasta into the sauce pan native got there?
that 's what these are pending.
we got there.
we got that just means ridge is right.
and so what we do is we take the ridges and we get the source incorporated into the whole thing that 's what it 's all about, about all these flavors coming together and just a little bit of a toss, which takes just a little practice not to dirty are beautiful stove there.
an we have the sauce incorporated, it 's nice and rich and thick.
and the only thing i need to do let 's get it over to these guys with their wine.
and he would go a little bit for you, my friend, thank you.
so this design center that we 're in right now is pretty awesome.
we have a lot of different things in here and will probably get a scan around the place.
but this was built in the set was built with the idea of displaying kitchens, but then with the idea of you eating all the time.
absolutely , then, you called me up and made me cook.
it worked out perfect it works out great for all here.
we go a little part of me.
john cheese over the top.
let 's give it a shot guys, try it out.
that 's our second pasta dish, now.
we 're going to come back and do a little bit more variety.
right now it just send tomato and cream or just straight cream and cheese, but we 're going to start adding vegetables to it.
so for those of you looking for a great vegetarian, digging guys 'cause it 's always good to eat downloads and when you thinking about a really good vegetarian dish.
now how do we finish that with cream.
you 'll see it all right after this culinary minute.
