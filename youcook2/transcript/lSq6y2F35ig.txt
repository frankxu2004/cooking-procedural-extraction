welcome to foods one oh one today.
i 'm going to show you how to make this waldorf salad.
now this salad was first presented at the new york city.
waldorf , astoria hotel between eighteen ninety three and eighteen ninety, six so it 's really classic fruit salad that 's been around for awhile to get this salad.
started you 're going to need a large red skinned apple issue can see right here.
i 've cord it.
edit , and i size pieces as you can see here.
i 've got a half of a cup of pecans now.
this recipe originally calls for walnuts.
but i 've slightly roasted a half a cup pecans because i 'm out of walnuts today.
and it 's OK to put whatever not you 'd like.
also , i have a half a cup of sliced celery and a half.
a cup of red grapes that these are slice now, if you do n't have red grapes go ahead and use about a fourth of a cup of that will do the trick i have three tablespoons of mayonnaise if you like to use yogurt, that would be great or even if you have sour cream, you may substitute yogurt or sour cream here for the mayo.
i have one tablespoon of lemon juice, one fourth of a teaspoon of fresh cracked pepper and one fourth of a teaspoon of kosher salt.
now we want to work fast.
because we do n't want these apples oxidizing.
so i 'm going to go ahead and add my diced apples here in the bow.
and i 'm going to quickly toss them with this fresh squeezed.
lemon juice, this way it 'll keep the apples from turning brown now, once we get this tossed in our lemon juice, we 're going to add the celery and the grapes.
and i 'm telling you this sell.
it is so nice and fresh and full of fabulous flavors.
i can see why it was definitely a favorite amongst.
the new yorkers back in the late eighteen hundreds.
now , to this, i 'm going to add the salt and the pepper.
now you also may add your salt and pepper into your mayo or your, you know, sour cream or yogurt.
whatever you 're going to use now.
we 're going to add, i 'm adding mayonnaise.
this is just pure mayonnaise.
the light stuff really is not going to work that, well, now if you 're going to serve this salad right away.
you want to go ahead and add your toasted walnuts or, pecans, or almonds.
whatever you want to add is your net the classic way of making this sell.
it is using the, the walnuts so that 's well incorporated.
so if you 're not going to serve your salad right away you want to wait to add your pecans.
but i 'm going to serve the salad right away.
so i 'm going to add my nuts.
given a nice little tossing and.
now this is ready to serve i, usually the waldorf, astoria salad is served on a bed of lettuce, which i 've served right here, and i 'm going to go on in get a piece of apple and celery and a little piece of grape and give it a try moo.
