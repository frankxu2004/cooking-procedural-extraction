about a year and a half ago somebody asked me make corn dogs.
and i told him, no, i would n't do it, but i changed my mind, i 'm going to use about one cup of cornmeal cup of flour.
one cup of milk some baking powder, cream style corn, do n't have to have that you can leave it out?
one fourth cup sugar, and egg and some hot dogs and salt.
and i believe that 's everything for the better.
i 'm going to use the food processor because i 'm going to use the canned corn cream corn.
otherwise , you do n't need to use one want to add the egg about four tablespoons of the cream corn, which is optional add done worth TSP assault mix.
is that very, well OK?
next , we 've had the cup of milk, the sugar, one fourth cup sugar, one cup of all purpose flour, baking powder two teaspoons of baking powder in the cornmeal one cup of cornmeal and that 's our batter can add other things to it if you like, like a little bit of red pepper cayenne pepper for jalapenos, and i need to let this rest for about fifteen minutes i 've taken my hot dogs and put a stick in there an dry him off very well, getting, really wanna, duckham get some coding on there you mean, your oil here just hold it down there yes, you can they wo n't come out perfect like what you buy in the store fit they 'll taste a lot better you are fridays for about three minutes to five minutes here have two of the corn dogs and cooled off for about three or four minutes i like mustard no.
excuse me, way better than repairs and what i bought thanks so much for watching.
