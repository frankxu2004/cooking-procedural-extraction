i 'm going to show you how to make an easy minestrone soup, and when i say easy, i mean, easy you are going to love how simple this is, you 're not going to believe it.
so all you need to do is start with a pot of water and turn it on.
get it going now the ingredients that we have over here are onions, carrots, celery and green beans.
some diced tomato, we have some kidney beans a little pasta.
these are little order.
katie parmesan and some parmesan rind, a bay leaf fresh parsley salt and pepper.
so all i 'm going to do is throw the ingredients into the boiling water or the simmering water and let him cook.
i learned this from my friend, alfredo cola, who is from naples, and i was amazed when he showed me the soup.
he said do n't know why would you saute them.
you just throw them in there, and they get all the flavors.
you 're essentially making a stock inside your soup, so onions carrots, celery and green beans can all go in together just like that.
i will also add a little bit of salt to this, as well as the tomatoes now the minestrone in general is a soup made with vegetables.
usually a being a pasta.
an and or rice not and or pasta or rice and a tomato product.
so we 're using fresh tomatoes to make it super simple on ourselves, and we 're going to, going to just let all of it vegetables simmer in there together for a little while.
and then we 're going to add well, first we 're going to add the parmesan rind.
and this is sort of a nice little trick to add some depth of flavor.
so if you have a perm piece of parm at your house, go ahead and just cut off a piece of grind, which you would normally throw away anyway and go ahead, and toss that right in your soup, and that 's only extra flavor and you 're going to get to utilize the entire hunk of cheese, which you know, you do n't want to you.
do n't want to waste any of this delicious parmesan, so that 's what we 're going to do?
OK , we 're also going to add one bay leaf and then i 'm going to put a lid on the pot and let it simmer.
now the beans.
because there already cooked.
i 'm not going to add until the end and the pasta is well the past that we 're going to add the very last ten minutes.
so that it 's not overcooked when we want to eat our soup.
so we 're just going to leave that pot there for about thirty forty five minutes and come back and check on it.
OK , so now that all of our vegetables are very tender in our minestrone, we 're going to go ahead and add the beans in the pasta.
so what i want to do first is make sure that the broth is seizing the way.
i want it because.
now , the POS is going to go in, and the pass is going to absorb the water from the broth.
so , we wanted to be properly seasoned so that the pasta in the end tastes good taste like the broth pretty good.
i 'm going to add a little tiny bit more salt.
it 's always easier to add some them to take it away so, i like to under salt first and continue to add.
so now i 'm going to go straight home with my kidney beans, you can use, any kind of being you like white beans, are often used?
i like cranberry beans, or borlotti beans as well, and.
now i 'm just going to add the pasta and pasta is, well, you can use whatever type of fossil you prefer, these are little tiny order cat that mean little ears and these are just tiny little ones.
and i like them a lot for minestrone or other brothy sauces.
because they have that little cup.
so they, they kind of scoop up the sauce in the broth of the juice, sort of.
carry it to your mouth or like your own little spoon.
so then i 'm just going to stir this up in here.
i 'm going to add a little bit of parsley as well.
now and then, i'ma save some for the end.
so you 're going to get it cooked into the sauce.
and then you 're going to get a freshness of it at the end as well.
so i 'm gonna put a lid on it and let him cook until the pasta is finished.
so the minestrone will only get better with time, so i recommend that if you have time you make it before you 're going to need it.
let it sit maybe even overnight and then heat it back up and add the pasta.
we 've already put the pasta in.
and it 's fully cooked now.
so now we 're just going to finish it off by giving it a little later right into the bowl, you can see the pasta and all of those wonderful veggies and the green beans and a little bit of parsley as well, we 're going to be a nice hearty, but.
but pretty light soup.
because we 've put it together fairly quickly it will get more intense flavor, the longer you let it sit.
so this is such a quick and easy way to do minestrone, i mean, you just throw it in a pot and let it simmer for awhile, and this is what you get this beautiful soup.
so now i 'm just going to finish it off with a little bit of graded, primary general cheese, of course, we already had the rind in, in the soup to begin an that 's going to add some depth of flavor and.
now we 're just going to give it another fresh sprinkle.
on the top it 's going to be and.
besides , that we 're going to go with a little bit of parsley and there you have it easy minestrone soup.
i hope you enjoyed it.
