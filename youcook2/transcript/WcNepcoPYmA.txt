hey guys, what is up?
it is michael from lean body lifestyle, more back today in the kitchen with another video and today we 're going to do is actually make one of the most requested videos ever, and, that is an oven baked chicken parmesan.
now this is really easy to make.
and then at the end of the video i 'm going to do another T shirt giveaway to give thanks to you, guys for watching all these videos.
i really do appreciate it every time you guys watch these so let 's go ahead and get started.
so , if you 're making chicken parmesan, you 're obviously going to need some chicken breasts now on this plate.
i have for chicken breasts, and what we 're going to do is cut each one in half.
so we have eight pieces.
and then after you cut them in half you can set them on a baking sheet that already have right here with some aluminum foil on top.
so now that we have the chicken cut up and out of the way we 're going to make the breading.
so the first ingredient that we 're going to use for the breading is a quarter of a cup of parmesan cheese.
and we 're going to pour that into a bowl.
then we 'll add three quarters of a cup of whole wheat bread, crumbs parmesan and then take a fork and mix the parmesan and breadcrumbs together, and as always, you can add any additional spices that you want to your breading mixture.
but today, i 'm going to keep it simple, and just add in some basil leaves.
next what you 're going to do is take two egg whites and crack those into another bowl.
and now we 're going to do is take one piece of the chick in and take the egg white mixture and just set the chick in, in the egg white mixture and really make sure you coat the chicken in the egg.
white , because that is, what allows for the breading to stick to it.
so after you 've dipped it in the egg white going to take that right over to our bowl of parmesan and breadcrumbs.
and each piece of.
chicken , one at a time and after you 're done coding your first piece go ahead and repeat the process for the remaining seven pieces of chicken.
so after your done coding the chicken, and you have any leftover in the bowl, you can scrape that out and sprinkle that on top of all of the chicken, then will fold our aluminum foil over the top and will put our chicken in the oven at four hundred and fifty degrees.
fahrenheit for forty minutes, so i 'll see you guys when these are done.
now here we are forty minutes later and we 're going to do is peel back the aluminum foil and take some scissors and cut off the extra part.
and then we 're going to do is take one cup of spaghetti sauce, or marinara sauce and dump that on top of the chick in, then we 'll take three quarters of a cup of low fat mozzarella cheese and sprinkle that on top of the chick in, in the sauce now, we 're going to do is put these back into the oven uncovered still at four hundred and fifty degrees.
fahrenheit for five minutes or until the cheese melts, so i 'll see you guys in a couple of minutes and now five minutes later, the cheese has melted.
so i 'll put one of these on a plate to give you guys.
a better view at home and here 's a better look for you guys to see at home of this oven, baked chicken parmesan.
i added a side of broccoli, but if you wanted to add, maybe some pasta to make this more like an italian dinner.
