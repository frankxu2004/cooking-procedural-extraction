hey , we 're running welcome to the wolfpit today, we 're going to make chinese roast pork fried rice.
and in order to make roast pork fried rice, need to have charsoo, which is chinese rosport, so we 're going to make a marinade real quick for charsoo.
then we start off three quarter cup of light soy sauce.
i have a couple of shell shing, chinese cooking wine.
one third cup hoisin sauce about three chunks plus the juice of red chinese fermented bean curd.
this is what gives it the color a third of a cup of honey at about tablespoon of chinese five spice powder.
we could mix all this together.
it looks like a blob, tablespoon, but it 's a tablespoon now.
we have about two pounds of pork shoulder that i 've cut up in small pieces so i 'm going to get this into our marinade.
are we have all our meeting are marinade?
and now we 're going to put this in the fridge for three to four hours are perks of marinating for about four hours.
now we have it on a broiler pan, and we 're going to put this under a broiler or low until gives nice, and roasted.
normally i 'd like to do this on the grill.
but i do n't have time tonight, so we can do it in that start.
after about fifteen minutes under broiler aloe or pork, is done when going into sliced up beautiful voice?
all right all our roast pork is sliced up.
i 'm going to go ahead and start frying, or rice.
or when it started front rice off of four eggs they 've been scrambled about three tablespoons of oil when i, when i ask about two teaspoons of garlic in half of a yellow onion and maybe three cups arise.
when i add about a cup of frozen peas and carrots.
right now we 're not half of report of two tablespoons of light soy sauce and the TSP such deal with.
and when i have rags back in alright there, you are fried rice is done in here and get a bite.
i 'm gonna cheat, a little bit.
here with these chopsticks and use them as a scooper i 'm not very good with chopsticks.
