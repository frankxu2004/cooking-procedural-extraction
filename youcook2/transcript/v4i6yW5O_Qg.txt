hey dudes on highlight and today on hilah cooking.
we are making pad thai.
this is a recipe that 's in your question, several times is probably the most famous thai dish that most people have heard of.
it 's a noodle dish.
we 're going to do some shrimp with it and i 'm really excited to share with you.
i 've been trying to figure out how to make this to like recreate the first time i had it when i was nineteen.
since i was nineteen and i think i finally got it.
some stoked to share it with you, let 's get this stir fry, and so that all my ingredients perhaps, that is, super important.
so you want to make sure that you 've got your niece imply in plot or in place.
so for the sauce i 've got some tamarind liquid tamron juice.
this is what a tamarin, vien looks like you can find these hole in a lot of like hispanic or latin markets or asian markets, and then you can find this juice in asian markets.
also , so using some of that, if you ca n't find it for some reason you could use lime juice.
but it is a little bit less than the recipe calls for, for the tamarind 'cause its lines, a little harder.
so tamron is very tart.
so we 're going to balance that with some sugar, and i should be using palm sugar.
but i 'm using light brown sugar.
because it 's a lot easier to find the palm sugar and some fish sauce and if you are vegetarian, and you do n't want to use fish sauce.
i think that you can find vegan.
that 's like sort of flavored like fish sauce, but does n't have fish in it.
i think if not you could use some soy sauce.
so what we 're doing here is like getting a good balance between sour, which is the tamarind and sweet and salty, which is the fish sauce.
i really like this red boat brand.
it 's just made from anchovies.
it does n't have any sugar, anything in it so it 's just gotta.
clean salty briny flavor, skip that combined and then all set that aside.
so i 'm using shrimp like i said eggs are pretty much seen in every pad thai unless you 're vegan and then i 've got some fried tofu cubes, fried these ahead of time if you want to see how to press an fry firm tofu.
i did a video on that along time ago with how to stir fry so you can go check that out.
if you want to got some peanuts some bean sprouts as a limes and then these are called garlic chives and their similar to regular tribes.
but you can see there really flat there much more, much more look like a blade of grass.
and they 're very pungent.
like they 're kind of making the whole kitchen smell garlicky onion Y right now, so, if you can find these use them they 're very perishable.
so try to use by.
i 'm just like a day or two before you need them, and keep them in the fridge just wrapped up in a damp towel target, kind of soften gross pretty quick.
or you can use regular size.
or you could use the onions.
and then i 've got a shallot that i 've thinly sliced and a whole lot of garlic and did i mention shrimp.
i do n't know OK, and some red pepper flakes OK, finally, the noodles, so i 've got these.
this is the kind that i like they 're called rice.
stick noodles i like this size medium.
you can give them in any width from like a quarter inch to all the way to two and a half, an inch.
and i like something that 's kind of in between that.
but their flat and long and all i 've done is taken half of that package an soaked it in some warm water for probably going about thirty minutes now.
so they go from looking like this amount of translucent anna little beige to looking like this, where there are more opaque and white.
and you want to just let him soak until they look like this, and when you bite apiece like between your molars it feels a little like your chewing on a rubber band, not.
so true that you ca n't like after a couple of bites like swallow it and chew it up.
fine , but like the first time, you bite into it, it kind of feels like you 're writing a rubber band.
so that 's good, we 're just going to let him stay in this water, this water is cooled off.
now i 'm just going to let her stay in the water until we need to add them to the walk.
you do n't have a walk.
just use a really big skillet, or even like a really big comb, all you need something, it 's big.
'cause this is a lot of stuff that we 're going to be putting in here if you do n't have a skillet or wok that 's approximately that size.
then you might want to cut this recipe into two.
you might want to have the recipe.
so we 're going to start out this on high heat.
now a little bit of oil on using safflower oil.
but peanut oil is probably more traditional.
once your oil gets hot will add in the shallots and garlic and fry those for maybe thirty seconds.
and in this case, you do want the garlic to get a little bit of color on it, and the shallots look at a little bit brown.
so we 're going to add the eggs and just let them set for about fifteen seconds.
and then start to break up the yolks and whites with your spatula.
so you end up with some distinct chunks of yellow and white, and then we 'll add are shrimp.
we could make this out if you do n't eat shrimp or you can use thinly sliced chicken breast or chicken, thighs instead going to add the shrimp and cook that for maybe sixty seconds just until the edges start to turn pink when they start to get a little bit cooked we do n't want to cook them all the way at this point and then we 'll add the tofu if you want to, if you want to use tofu after about sixty seconds of the shrimp here we 're going to add the noodles.
and i 'm just going to use some tongs to lift him out of the water and put them straight into the walk.
so that they 're not drained totally dry.
we want a little bit of that water that they are soaking in to cling to them add the noodles were going to add.
however much chili flake you want to use.
and then we 're going to add the tamarind sauce that we made and cook and stir fry.
this , for about five minutes until the noodles are soft an al dente and then we 'll add half of our peanuts.
half of our bean sprouts and half of the garlic chives and just stir fry that, for another thirty to sixty seconds until the bean sprouts have wilted, and then once all the sauces absorbed and the noodles are software radio.
serve anytime you do.
pad thai noodles kind of separate from the good stuff coming through a little twisty to make a cute.
and then you can pick out, you know, if you want to call or shrimp or whatever.
and you notice i left the tails on the shrimp.
and these i just crushed up in a mortar and pestle.
so that their various textures and peace sizes little peanuts maybe, a little more fresh chives, definitely some fresh bean sprouts, and then serve each bowl with a little language person, fresh sourness on top.
so there you go so, if you like this recipe, check out the how to stir fry video i, made along time ago to see how to fry your tofu.
if you want to do tofu.
i also did a spring, rolls video, a couple years ago, that would be a good accompany meant to this.
let 's see, how i did, i 'll tell you.
so i do n't know if you can remember how the noodles were before.
but now they are fully cooked still, they always have a little bit of a rubbery, ness to them.
but that 's part of the pleasure.
this is two gigabytes as usual.
this is pretty much exactly like i remember the first time i ever have had time in boston when i was nineteen.
and i thought it was like one of the best things i ever had in my life, and.
now i can eat anything i want to and.
