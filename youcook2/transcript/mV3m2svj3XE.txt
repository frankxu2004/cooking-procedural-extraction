OK , it 's mark wiens.
here in bangkok thailand today i 'm going to make the recipe for crock pot boom, which is thai fried rice with shrimp for this fried rice recipe.
i 'm going to be using shrimp a big green leaf of chinese broccoli, a small white onion garlic and egg, and finally day old rice.
but you can really substitute these ingredients for whatever you like chicken or pork for them eat.
bok , choy or any kind of crisp green, vegetable or mix of vegetables will work too before you get started with the fried rice.
the first thing to do is to make something called pick, not blah which is chili 's in fish sauce.
and it is an absolute must have when you make thai fried rice to add three tablespoons of fish sauce to a small bowl.
no need to measure it exactly just sort of guess it.
chili 's again you can choose to add as many as you like i 'm going to use about five.
pull off the stems and then just slice them finally and add them to the fish sauce.
finally , to give your picnic blah sour tinge squeezing about half a lime.
that 's all there is to it.
quick note blah.
and now it 's ready set that aside i 'm going to use about ten small shrimp for this recipe, so, if you 're using shrimp two, the first step is to peel off the head, and most of the outer shell only the tail on that 's the way.
you 'll find it in thailand.
garlic peel, two cloves, and then just coarsely, mince them.
i 'm using half of a very small sweet, white onion slice it into wedges, lengthwise, take three or four green onions sliced off the bottom roots and then cut them finally.
next , take your chinese broccoli or whatever green leafy, vegetable, you 're using, and cut one big leaf in half first.
and then slice it into one centimeter.
sized strips, i got all of the ingredients prepped, and ready to go going to light up the and heat up my walk.
but i just want to say that in order to make good cop on you need to use rice that has actually day old rice works very well.
but if you take it out of the rice cooker, just make sure it 's cool down and even if it risks for a couple hours.
that 's a good idea and it will make for better fried rice 'cause it 's a little dryer.
turn on your stove and add about one tablespoon of oil for frying.
make sure the oil.
it 's nice and hot before you drop in the garlic stir fry.
the garlic for about fifteen seconds, or so their shrimp cook the shrimp stir fry and continuously for about thirty seconds.
and then add half of your rice.
this is a little trick, the little bit of rice first, is going to soak up all those delicious shrimp juice?
is just a few seconds later, scoot your rights to one side of the walk and cracking an egg kind of world that egg around?
and then start to mix it up with your shrimp and rice.
now stir fry until your egg looks like it 's cooked all the way through then toss in the rest of your rice.
give it a quick stir.
and then add half a tablespoon of soy sauce.
half a tablespoon of oyster sauce and just that tiny pinch of sugar stir fry for another fifteen seconds, or.
so and then toss, in your chinese broccoli and the sliced white onion, try the rice for another thirty seconds, and then toss in the green onions, a few more seconds.
and it 's ready.
remove it from the heat and dish it onto a plate.
when you order cop out in thailand to your plate, will normally come with an extra wedge of lime on the side, a sprinkle of pepper on top.
and of course, that wonderful picked number chilies and fish sauce, which is a typical condiment found on every street food table one thing is for certain when you 're cooking, in bang cock, you will sweat profusely.
but it 's worth the end result.
so you can see this cup going it has really beautiful orangey pink tinge to it, and that comes from the, the oils from that shrimp head.
i 'm going to first give it another squeeze of lime to top it off love that extra hint of lime juice all over the first step of any bite of cop out is to take some of the picnic blah, get some of those chili 's going and some of the fish sauce on top and beautiful OK.
all that 's delicious.
i love that little sour tinge from the lime juice.
the hint of saltiness from the picnic blah and that heat from the chili just a good classic lunch dish right there.
