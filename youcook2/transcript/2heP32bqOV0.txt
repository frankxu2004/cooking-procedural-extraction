hi , everybody today i 'm going to attempt to make goulash recipe an usually these recipes calls for about three pounds of me and, i 'm trying to make it.
so i could have a smaller portion and uh, i went with one pound of meat right here.
let 's start by cutting this meat and to cubes and will pat them dry and will put some pop recon it and we 'll go from there paprika OK, nice piece six side.
but OK, that 's a good one.
so the next step will just pat them dry.
because we 're going to brown them.
nice , they would n't want steam them, grab some pop rica about a tablespoon of perfect.
also , some fresh ground pepper great.
let 's set this aside, we 're going to, we 're going to add leftover.
so we need one medium onion, just sliced and will break it up, paris, so, uh, for this.
we 're going to use a little bit of olive oil to saute the nothing.
yet will put this medium high to start.
and just, just spring for pizza, so there not to clump together alright so now that there are semi, translucent we 're going to just move them to suffer.
i 'm right away after this.
i 'm using the quiz nard six.
ford reply anna, really, really hot, really good pot.
the next step is to sear the meat.
so for that we 're going to put the heat on high and this thing is starting to smoke.
but i 'm going to.
so i 'm just going to transfer the meat here all four sides of the main all sides of the meat here gonna take us about five minutes or so.
this fearing here and at this point.
i 'm not going to pass water at.
we 're going to add about one third of mccann of a six ounce, tomato face, i 'm going to lower that number to little, we 're gonna add.
the , the onions a quarter of a teaspoon of cumin, not quarrel with TSP curry, and you can add either chicken consomme or, or vegetable.
but and i, i like to use this brand.
it 's the post time.
soup that seasoning mix.
it 's really it 's really great.
has a lot of flavor about two tables to tease?
go ahead and scariest thing up make sure you pick up the bits and pieces from the bottom of the pan, and we 're going to bring it down to a simmer.
do i have to cover the pan, and this can go like that for about an hour and a half?
so i 'm going to set the timer for an hour and a half.
i maybe an hour at a time, i would come back after an hour and check the tenderness of the meat and if it needs a little more cooking, then just continue OK , right.
so it 's been about thirty minutes, and i 'm going to give it a good steer smells great.
so the one hour and ten minutes or so, has passed an steered the pot from every thirty minutes or so, ann.
i do n't think it 's ready.
i think it does need another half hour.
but i 'm just going to grab one, and i 'm going to cut into it and taste it and stay out.
see if i like it and by the way, temperature focus, focus, nice, yum, yum, oh, oh, goodness, this is good translator.
i think it 's actually writing, it 's nice.
