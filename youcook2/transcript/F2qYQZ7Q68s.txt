hey , everybody and welcome to the wolfpit.
it 's not going to make some beef and bean burritos.
not really shooting for an authentic recipe.
this is just going to be the way i 'm going to make him tonight.
so what we have here.
so far is we got two pounds of frozen eighty twenty ground beef.
so we 're going to melt this down an brown.
it up all right around because all ground up.
and there 's not really a lot of fat in this.
but it was eighty twenty.
but it 's sure not a lot of fat in there.
so i 'm not going to granite.
so now what i 'm going to do is add in one large yellow onion chopped up and one medium bell pepper chopped up.
now i 'm going to add in our seasonings to about two teaspoons of black pepper tablespoon of granulated garlic, a teaspoon of salt tablespoon of oregano, teaspoon of cumin and about three tablespoons of chili powder right now.
i 'm gonna add.
in about a cup of salsa and one can of undrained black beans this is just my preference.
i hear a lot of so people grill with me a little bit about not granting the beans.
but i like to juice in the beans right now, going to add in about, about a cup and a half of cooked rice alright.
we got our burrito filling all done.
all the moisture is pretty much soaked up all right.
so we 're going to put about a half a cup of filling inside the burrito, and they were in a sprinkle that with some cheese and.
now we 're going to roll it up suiza, tight hold it over when rolled up as important to heat up your shells just a little bit.
otherwise , we 're going to crack alright are beef and bean, burritos are done.
and you could, you could top these with guacamole salsa sour cream.
jalapenos , what have you i 'm just going to eat him playing tonight.
so go ahead and bust into one of these and see how they turned out hum.
