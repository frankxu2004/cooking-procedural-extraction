i 'm trey, basore from pro nash in new york city.
i 'm going to show you how to make the perfect hollandaise green start with cracking, are eggs, and we 're only going to use the yolks.
we 're going to place it right into our bowl here.
so we have our egg yolks in our bowl, and then we have a pot with water underneath, and we 're just going to similar this water.
we 're going to add, are lemon juice?
and then what we 're doing this is a double boiler.
this allows us to cook are egg yolks, but to not scramble them usually.
this will take anywhere between three and a half to five minutes depending on how hot your water is, underneath it.
so we 're going to cook it to where we see ribbons right, where it just starts keeping its shape when you lifted above and this is where we 're going to add our butter.
so we just want to melted butter and slowly add it why we 're still whisking this egg mixture.
just a little bit at a time, incorporate it, and then keep going back if you add all of it at once, then it 's easy for what we call the emotion to break, and that 's when it becomes greasy and just not a smooth nice fluffy sauce going to season it with salt and a little bit of pepper, and then, you know, you have the perfect consistency when you put in the spoon, and it just pours easily.
and that 's going to coat your eggs, benedict or whatever you 're having perfectly for playboy dot com.
i 'm traders or pieces of coconut, and then we grind them up, and make this like powder, and you 're going to pour the water into the ground up meat.
then , give it a nice massage.
and this is what will release the coconut milk essentially.
