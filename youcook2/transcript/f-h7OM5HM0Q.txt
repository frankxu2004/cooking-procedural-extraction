hi , guys ulurp italian, and this episode of lorena kitchen, i want to share with you.
my recipe for beef, bergen young, or defeat burgundy stew now.
i 'm not by any means, saying this is the traditional like authentic version.
this is kind of my adaptation on it.
because i 've never been to france.
so this is kind of my take on it, the very first time i had this was amazing.
french bistro in san francisco, and it 's completely stayed with me for years since that.
and i started to kind of play around with things that make my own version of it, really love this recipe.
it 's easy to make it 's got incredible flavor, and it 's just a crowd pleaser.
the ingredients will need for the base and there 's additional ingredients which will go to in a little bit later and get some chuck that i have about large size chunks.
i also have got some carrots and onion, other carrots that kind of kept it nice, and big.
i also have some garlic that i 've just peeled.
but i have n't chopped it.
i 've got some thick sliced bacon that i 've chopped only some beef stock, going to be faced back here.
first time need some tomatoes.
some pepper touch of olive oil you need a little bit of cognac or brandy and you need some burgundy wine.
if you do n't have burgundy you can use pinot, noir, which is actually when i 'm using today.
it 's a bit more cost effective.
i had it on hand, so i figured i would use that.
and i 've used this before it works really great.
key auntie really works great in this recipe, as well, and a quick tip.
if you do n't want to dish up big bucks for a bottle of cognac or brandy get yourself wanting little nips, you know, these are great at the liquor store.
if you just buy what you need if you 're anything like me i do n't cognac or brandy so buying.
little ones for cooking really helps.
i do n't have any waste.
it 's not sitting on my shelf for a long time when i only need a little bit of it anyways.
i 'm going to big pot here preheating over about medium high heat in there.
i 'm going to add in the bacon, and i 'm going to let that render and get nice and crispy.
in the meantime, while that 's happening, we move some stuff out of the way.
i 'm going to take my beef to me.
i also have some all purpose flour here.
i 'm going to coat my beef and flour, and i 'm going to season this with salt and pepper.
now the flower does two things.
a coat, the beef, so it gives it a really lovely crossed when you see right, but it also helps thicken the sauce as well, so two birds.
one stone that kind of thing, and it 's going to take a big spoon and tossed this together to make sure all my beef is coded in the flower, and the song pepper great.
let me just fished out with like a slotted spoon or something 'cause you want to keep that bacon fat back there.
so just take that out.
try your hardest not to eat all of it before you put it back in the pot because frazier, hannaford, guilty of it.
i 'm so notorious for doing that is, terrible.
now at this point if your bacon did n't give out a lot of fact like minded mines got a few tablespoons of fat in there, then you would go ahead and add a bit of a bit of olive oil.
but mine gave out quite a good amount of fat.
so i 'm just going to do this with my hands i 'm going to put my beef in there, and that 's been coated with my flower song pepper.
so good i 'm telling you, your house is just going to be filled with the most incredible aroma , ever.
i 'm going to do some matches because i do n't want to overcrowd the pan.
let him cook for a few minutes when it 's all over the place for the nice thing goes in round and then we 'll move on to the.
next step and all my meat colorful beautiful color, let me just kind of drill bit more al gore.
now all those brown bits in there, mega flavor.
so do n't you dare cleanup pot and add my veggies in at my onion carrot and whole cloves of garlic season them with salt and pepper and the moisture from the veggies is gonna help with kind of release.
those brown big stuck at the bottom of the pan, and then also if we add the liquid, it will help as well.
so then give this a good third and let the veggies cook for about five to six minutes or until they develop some color and start to cook down a bit.
they look good.
i 'm going to add in my cognac.
you 'll need quarter, copper sell.
i would say a whole little nip.
this is fifty mills and just you can see as soon as you add the liquid look what happens.
and you scrape the bottom of the pan all those juices just released now.
i 'm going to make something talk about this.
because i know i 'll get a lot of questions whether or not you can leave out the wine and the koniak just go ahead and make a different recipe.
because this recipe is the cognac or brandy and the wine just add the sweetness.
but this recipe needs.
so if you are not an alcohol drinker, then just make my pot roast or something else.
that 's a braised beef because this dish is as delicious as it is because of the because of the wine so tomato paste.
i 'm just starting that in for about a minute now, i 'm going to add in a couple of cups of wine now.
traditionally , you use an entire bottle of wine.
i 'm using only a couple of cups and i 'm going to do a couple help to stop.
because now this dish is traditionally a very sweet kind of stew and i find that if you add all wine, it 's too sweet.
so i want to balance that by adding half wine half big stack, and the end result is incredible.
it 's sort of right balance.
when i had this with the first time, it blew me away.
i heard about a lot of TV people, cooking it.
but i never kind of OK from a really good french bistro before.
so we went to san francisco a few years ago, and i had it, i mean, it blew me away.
and i just been hooked ever since the only thing i did differently that i cut, i cut the wine in half.
so that it 's not so.
so sweet because it is, is pretty on the sweet side?
then i 'm going to add my stock.
but you guys know.
i just add my feet base.
only grab a small spoon.
how dare not be prepared.
but , you know, sometimes that happens what can i say.
i 'm just going to stir that in and also going to add some time.
now traditionally this is cooked in the oven, i 'm going to cook it on my stove top with a lid on for a few hours or until the beef is nice and tender sliding the beef and my bacon.
right back in i 'm going to bring this to a boil lower down to medium, low cover to let us simmer for a couple of hours or until the beef is tender be warned that the spell in your home will be unbelievable.
trust me, it 's something really out of this world.
it smells incredible, already wait till this gets going.
this is been cooking, for about two hours, but two hours and fifteen minutes and you can see, i mean, it is gorgeous.
the meat is really nice and tender look like, and pretty much breaking apart.
you can see what the wooden spoon.
now we 're going to add our sub paid mushrooms and all their mushrooming juices.
now make sure you taste this for seasoning.
i have tasted this for seasoning.
if i can tell you, it is perfect for me because of that salty bacon.
we salted meat, we sorted the veggie, so there 's certain every layer.
so i 'm going to leave it as if an my onion my parsley.
i 've got some parsley chopped up here, but a quarter cup.
i really want that freshness, ah for just i added my pearl onions.
they were thawed this just need to cook together for just a few minutes just to kind of warm up.
those pearl onions, i mean, we have gorgeously think that is, and that really does help it really does come from coding the beef and flower.
now i 'm just going to clean up really quickly.
i 've got some egg noodles and i 'm bowling back that i 'm going to talk a little bit of butter, you can serve this over anything whether it 's mashed.
potatoes , egg noodles with a potato graph, ten on the side, anything you want a little bit easier today.
i 'm going with egg noodles, or just a staple, and it 's really, really easy to whip together in no time.
and it 's just a perfect bed for those juices and unlovely.
my math is celebrating.
i 'm going to clean up, get the egg noodles and put this together, that is just incredible.
i 've got my egg noodles here that i have buttered just got a little bit for my husband, and i for dinner and show you what this looks like i mean, look at this look at how sick and gorgeous, that is, i mean, can we just take a minute to admire you can smell the smokiness from the bacon like immediately it 's just amazing could also smell the cognac as well let me just go for the piece of beef right here you do n't even have a two distance.
so it falls apart?
it 's got lovely smoky flavor, you can taste the wine.
it 's not overly sweet.
that 's got a great balance.
i hope that you check out this recipe, and i hope that you make it and enjoy it as much as we do.
i have been just buying time with me.
the recipe will be over, and it 's not come as always.
and i 'll see you next time bye , bye.
