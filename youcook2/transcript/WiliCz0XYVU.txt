hi guys, so today i 'm going to be teaching you how to make pasta E.
this is a copy cat of olive gardens recipe, and it is delicious to start off with your going to need one pound of sweet italian pork sausage that is already grounded.
cooked four cups of chicken stock.
one fifteen ounce can of diced tomatoes.
i 'm using the italian style.
one fifteen ounce.
can , of tomato sauce, one tablespoon, oregano one teaspoon of time, one cup of chopped carrots?
one cup of chopped celery onions.
one fourth cup of olive oil four cloves of minced garlic, one fifteen ounce, can of dark web comedians, one fifteen ounce.
can of light red kidney.
beans one fifteen ounce can of great northern beans and two cups a slightly undercooked, ditalini pasta, first set your heat to medium and then get a big pot and dump your four cups of chicken stock in it.
next take your can of tomato sauce and dump it in the pot.
and i liked rinsed mine can out with water and dump that water into the pot as well.
add your diced tomatoes to the pot and then add your one pound of ground pork sausage next agger.
one tablespoon of a regen, oh, and one teaspoon of time to your pop after all of your ingredients are in the pot and give it a good nice stir.
going to saute the carrots onion celery and garlic and another pan on medium heat.
so add all of these ingredients and add some olive oil and are just going to sate these for about five minutes, or until the onions are nice and translucent.
after your carrots celery onion and garlic are all set aid we 're going to add them to your big pot of soup.
do you want to stir this?
and then cover it with a lid.
and you 're going to want it to simmer for about fifteen to twenty minutes or until the celery are nice and tender.
after the fifteen to twenty minutes is up remove the lid and add your beans.
you 're going to want to rinse and drain these beans out of the can and then you 're going to add in your pasta.
and again this should be slightly undercooked so that way when you add it into your really hot soup it cooks it just a little bit more.
but it does n't get the pasta too soggy, so just stir it up until it 's nice and fixed.
so there you have it a nice huge pot of pasta E fagioli.
