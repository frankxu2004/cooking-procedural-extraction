hi guys, i 'm amy and i 'm julie.
we 're doing a singapore fried rice noodle with curry is you can see it 's a bright yellow sort of concoction.
it 's super yummy, so, let 's get started so there is it going to be using today are rice noodles, which are ones like this.
all we 've done here is just sort them in cold water for about half an hour.
we 're going to leave them in the intralot ready to cook that we 're going to do our problems, which is the meat in this dish or we want to do is pop in a wee bit of cornflower about a teaspoon for one hundred and fifty grams is good this coats or the problems.
and gives it like a really kind of locks and all the moisture of the points.
but also gives it a really kind of like silky coaching around the outside.
they do n't rub report.
there 's no one, no one likes a rubbery, prawn.
so we just put about a tablespoon of oil in the walk.
now you want this quite hot do n't do it, you do it, you basically fear those prawns immediately.
so in it goes.
so we just going to certify these for about two to three minutes until their flesh of the prawns as pink infirm.
so as you can see the pros are now a lovely or pike kind of peach color.
and i 've got a lovely lacrosse on them as well, so they are ready to come up lovely two person job obviously, obviously brilliant.
so for the omelette, i have a couple of beaten eggs.
salt , and pepper in some oil.
and , we 're just going to put that right into a hot frying pan.
now you could just do the easy is a scramble in the walk as well, but i think there 's something really like.
is quite joyful about picking up ribbons of X?
we 're going to cut the into ribbons, so picking that up with your chopsticks along with the rice noodles so the egg is just cooking now.
we have n't moved it at all.
and we 're just going to keep it on here until it 's almost all i paid before i transfer it to the chopping board looking from the residual hate.
some almost there, so the AMA is ready to come out of the pan.
so just slide it straight onto your chopping board, and then we 're going to roll this baby up spit hot.
and you can see how the undersides lovely in golden like those listed.
bits that 's gonna be done.
it looks like tiger cake, if she does n't, does n't like tiger cake, which is one of the recipes that we have in our upcoming cookbook plug your little plug.
it all the only we just like flip it in my hand.
so just cut this or just strips you can see that these ribbons are going to be almost like egg noodles.
and why is n't it.
yeah , yeah, lovely alright.
so i 'll fire up the walk.
get it on a kind of medium hate, and they will put some oil in so in with the garlic like this is a wee bit.
thanks , amy wu lovely.
so we 'll just meet that kind of do its thing releasing its flavors for a burn, and we like to do the onions and the garlic.
first , because they flavor the oil which is going to be really delicious for the risk of abusers.
so we 're really now to put our red paper, but this size, you do n't really need to cook up a true long.
we 're just going to stir fry.
this , for about a minute.
because it 's all going to go back into the noodles later.
so bad about this stage when you can see that the onion kind of has little blisters on it.
everything is pretty much ready to come out.
sorry , just pull it straight back into your vessel, sorry, there is it for the beach.
we really get onto the noodles.
so for this, we only want the walk on kind of, like a low to medium heat.
and you 'll put some oil in the about tablespoon, and this is the part where we just fish these noodles straight out of here.
so that they stay moist.
because the rice flour, which is what these are made of in alarm sucks up moisture loss.
so just give it like a little shake, and in straightened and to that, we 're going to add some curry powder, which has been mixed up with a wee bit of water.
so when you do this, then paste it, just makes it easier to incorporate into the noodles.
it always get classic curry and it 's like it 's not fair, someone gets more carry than the other person, is there how you feel about it?
i need a new, there OK alright so that we get true.
it 's gonna take a little bit of tossing action.
you can just leave the water here just get your hands on me and sprinkle it in the way that mom used to do it.
right you can bring it up a little bit.
but we did n't actually cook these noodles.
not brightness caper.
this floats in the water.
so we 're using the heat.
now to really soften them and use the residual kind of like moisture that was.
so hanging on to each node and kind of cook through right now.
we 're going to put on some beans for us.
so , i mean, if you want to take over this action and all the other bits we can bring it all back in and if you find, the noodles, changer, clumped together away.
but just a wee bit more water, it 's just gently does it really 'cause if you put it all at once.
so you with group hopefully are going to go back in with a broad and then your veg a ribbons about a tablespoon of soy sauce for seasoning.
so you just need to finish up some spring onions and say it 's right for a bit of freshness and vitality, oh, in a wee bit of salt some popping away.
but his boat here and spring onions, final toss, and the only ready to play it up.
