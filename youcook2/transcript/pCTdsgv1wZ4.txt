i am jim warner from the wexner medical center at the ohio state university, and today we 're going to talk about a one pot.
minestrone soup, which is about a twenty minute soup.
it 's high in protein.
it 's a lower in fat little bit, lower in sodium an.
it 's a great soup takes about twenty minutes, is about six ingredients and the beauty of this is it really only takes one pot to make this entire batch of soup?
what we 're going to do is we 're going to add some low sodium low fat chicken broth to the pan like this.
we 've got about a quart in here and the thing that you really want to look at is when you 're looking at the nutrient information or the back of the container.
this has about four hundred twenty milligrams of sodium.
so if we were to get the regular chicken broth that would have eight hundred forty milligrams of sodium per portion the average amount of sodium standard today is two thousand milligrams per day.
so if you eat one cup of soup you 're really about their halfway there, already.
so that 's one of the reasons that we went with the low sodium, fat free broth, going to let this cook and actually bring this to a real quick boil.
now we 're waiting for that.
the boy we 're going to talk about some of the meat that were put in here, we 're using chicken tenderloin which is a little more expensive.
but the great thing about chicken tenderloin is a cooks very quickly.
it 's very low fat and when you add it to your soup, it adds some flavor to your broth as well.
the other ingredients that we have that make it simple.
we 've got a mixed frozen vegetable, which is green beans.
some corn and carrots in here we have a whole wheat pasta.
we 're going to add to that.
we 've got some fresh spinach that we 're going to finish this off with.
and we have parmesan reggiano cheese and parmesan reggiano cheese.
somewhat compensates for the salt that you will put in the soup, and they 're going to see it with black pepper real simple to make.
now we 've got the broth is already moved, and you can tell by the way, the broad is starting to start around a little bit, movements are gonna add are chicken tenderloins to the broth and what we 're going to do is let these cook, and you 're going to these cook till they 're no longer pink in the center for about five or six minutes.
we 're going to put these in, here and let them go.
so we 've got the chicken tenderloins that are already cooking in the broth, they took about four five minutes and the thing that 's great about using these.
because there 's no bones in her very little connective tissue that cook very, very quickly what we 're going to do is we 're going to take the chicken tenderloins out of the broth and while we 're taking these out, and we 're going to let them call their own, chop them are going to put them right back into the soup, while these are sitting here , kohli.
and we 're going to add the whole weight pasta in this case reason pene pasta, which really works, well, it 's a whole grain pasta and this holds up well in the soup and actually is about the same size of the chicken meat which is really what you want, you want to use a larger size pasta or smaller size pasta you want the food in the soup, or any dish you make to look assistant size.
so and add the pasta in store that around a bit we 're going to add our veggies.
do n't let these cook for about twelve minutes?
and the pain is still very, very hot because we had boil the chicken breast, here the chicken tenderloins.
now we 're going to let this cook for about twelve minutes are going to chop the chicken tenderloins.
we 're going to add that back to the soup, and we 're almost done.
so we 're going to go ahead and chop up the chicken tenderloins and again.
these are cooked completely.
and if you look how easy these chop, and how great they 're going to taste in this soup, is going to be delicious?
so what will do with his chicken tenders.
is while everything else is cooking, we 're going to add these back into the soup, not only going to add some flavor they 're going to add some depth to the soup, as well, and again you want to handle these when you 're able to handle them you do n't want to handle them when they were super, super, hot, or you 're going to end up burning yourself?
but you really do n't want to do and take our chicken.
we 're going to add this to our soup, and you can tell already this soup looks great because it 's got a lot of color.
it 's got a lot of texture to it.
you 've got the pasta noodles in here.
you 've got the frozen vegetables, and then you have the chicken in here.
so there 's a lot of things going for this soup that makes it really, really good.
plus it 's low sodium super spin cooking for about eight minutes, right now and the noodle that we 're using today is a whole wheat noodle.
this is about ready to go the noodles themselves or about al dente, which means firm to the bite, go ahead.
you see the soup.
it 's getting into a good boy over to go ahead and add.
are fresh spinach.
you can use frozen spinach in this recipe as well, but i prefer to use fresh spinach.
actually , this spinach here when you see, when we add to soup it 's going to end up into.
next to nothing.
because spinach really contracts when it cooks, i 'm going to go ahead and add this to the soup, and if you like spinach, you can always add more to it.
so you can see this soup looks great lots of color in the soup, which is really, what you want with your food.
because we tend to eat with our eyes, and if you see the colors that we have here, the greens the yellows, the oranges just beautiful looking soup, and again it takes very little time to prepare this product today.
so right now the spinach is actually ready to go.
we 're going to turn off the flame.
take a little bit of black pepper.
and i 'm going to season it with black pepper.
can this soup is ready to go?
they want to go ahead.
and we 've got this nice lookin soup dish here going to go ahead and add this to the bowl OK.
here is roughly about eighteen ounces of soup lots of color we 're going to have some parmesan reggiano, reggiano cheese to this, as well, and we 've got a really good looking soup.
