hey , what 's up guys.
i hope you had a very happy new year, today 's recipe is going to be a nice, fresh and crisp way to kick off twenty.
fifteen , so today i 'm going to show you my take on waldorf salad alright.
so first up, we 're going to make some stovetop, candied, walnuts.
so get a small nonstick pan on medium heat.
add the walnuts brown sugar.
honey and a good pinch of salt, down here to cook it for about ten minutes, while stirring as it cooks once there properly glazed and slightly darkened.
you 're going to dump them out onto a container line with some parchment paper or some wax paper and allow to cool until you 're ready to use next, going to slice up a few gala apples into eighth inch slices.
approximately then cut the slices lengthwise to make batter nays or these little match like stick pieces.
there are nice little garnishing touch.
but make sure to toss the cut apples in a little bit of lemon juice and olive oil to prevent them from turning brown.
it also has a nice little refreshing citrus, flavored to apple.
but once you 've done doing that set him aside until you are ready to use alright, so after done with the apple are going to grab some end.
i 've cut the brown portion of the stem off.
then you 're going to quarter it lengthwise.
season , and i 've wedges with a little bit of olive oil salt and fresh cracked.
black pepper, and then going to grill the endive on a very hot griddle for about two to three minutes on each side.
once that 's done, you have some really beautiful grill marks on the end.
i 'm going to remove him from the grill and gather everything to play the salad.
so here i 'm going to dress a little bit of freezing and ready go, with some lemon juice.
some olive oil little bit of kosher salt and some fresh cracked.
and i 'm going to use this mix as the base for this salad basically it 's going to be the bedding and it 's.
also , add a nice little texture with the beautiful freeze and the color of the ridiculous next time.
just going to lay down a few pieces of that grilled warm, and i 've, and this is going to act as really sort of the meet andy at the hardiness of this salad, after that.
i 'm going to garnish it with a few pieces of the candied, walnuts, then a few, those batanea 's of the gala apple and then here i 'm going to develop some yogurt that i just put the squeeze bottle.
it 's a nice little garnishing touch to a beautiful salad, and then.
finally , some blue cheese, and then, of course, i love my little mini herb.
so i 'm going to show with just of parsley.

and at the end i was grilled really nice little char.
flavor , the apples are great at a nice sweetness to it, along with the, the candied, walnuts, so good a ton going on with this SOB, grilled.
endive gathered ekigho, nice little bats in a are these little matchstick apples.
the little lemon vinaigrette with lemon and olive oil.
the freezer has a really beautiful little fluffy texture has a nice crunch to it as well.
the candied, walnuts are amazing.
i could just eat those by the handful which i usually do, and what else i 'm missing.
something , all the yogurt just said a little bit of yogurt goes such a long way with this recipe.
but with this salad in particular, in with certain dishes that require that sort of salinity or that saltiness with it, it has a nice little punch of taking this too it just melts this whole salad together this is a great example of the beauty of deconstructing sort of the idea of a recipe you can have fun with it play with it reinvent dishes.
