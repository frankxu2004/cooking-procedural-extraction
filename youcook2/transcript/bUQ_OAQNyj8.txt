hello , i 'm chef diane demayo, an welcome to my kitchen.
today 's bootleg tip is how to make kimchi, what is kimchi?
it 's a fermented cabbage, specifically napa cabbage, but you can ferment any type of vegetable for kim.
she super delicious a little smelly but easy to make napa cabbage first thing that you have to do to make kimchi is, you want to get this insult.
why salt because salt does a couple of things it actually dehydrates it removes the water from it and makes stabilized environment.
so that the right bacteria can grow in it cut it and you do n't have to be particularly fancy.
and how you cut it, it 's all going to end up kind of, smash.
the jar anyways and what we want to do is get it in bowl.
i use any type of salt there 's a lot of rumors, about what salt not to use or whip salt to use i 'm korean.
i grew up in a household, one weather really did n't give a damn what kind of salt we use as long as a result on it.
this takes about an hour for the water to be removed from the cabbage weapons were going to drain it, squeeze it and add all the other essential ingredients.
it looks like i 'm putting a lot of cabbage in here.
an i really am.
but once all the salt removes the water it 's going to go down by at least a half if not a quarter of the cabinets in here.
so , let 's set this aside and give it an hour spent.
about an hour and my cabbage as i said, has shrunk by half the volume just have to rinse it, squeeze out the water.
an add the other ingredients.
what are the other ingredients we have garlic lots of garlic?
we love garlic and, garlic and kimchi.
there 's no other way to do it.
ginger , ginger goes in here as well.
the ginger and essential key ingredient is korean pepper.
flakes , course or fine, you can buy in most korean stores, they have two different types, different sizes, you need this to make kimchi tan.
i do mind vegetarian style, or vegan style where i do n't add any type of baby shrimp or fish sauce to it.
but you can add whatever you want to give that extra kit, so let 's get over the sink wash it out.
then add the other ingredients cabbages, rinsed squeezed out.
we 're going to add everything else i like mike him.
she spicy so i 'm going to add alot, alot, alot, alot, alot of red pepper ginger, you can actually put out you can put all of your ginger and garlic into food processor.
so it comes out nicely minced.
you do n't do that easily.
chop it up.
it does n't matter.
i do n't suggest that you buy garlic that 's already pre cut 'cause it always has such a nasty flavor.
and that 's just something that you do n't want.
remember lots of garlic lots of ginger.
once all of this is in kim, she takes about twenty four hours if not longer to ripen and generally it takes the temperature of about seventy two degrees in sunlight or a light environment.
in order for the good bacteria to foster if you do n't want to write them right away.
then you want to keep it in your refrigerator or in a dark place in korea, we used to take big vats.
kind of like ceramic pitbulls, put kimchi in it.
steal it really well, and dig a hole in the ground and bury, it.
and it would be fresh for months until you dug it up.
that 's how we used to do it in korea, got all my garlic in mix.
that 's hot and as you see nice color, this will ferment and be super.
you can put this in a jar before you seal it.
make sure that there 's a piece of saran wrap over it and put a rubber band on it because it keeps all the oxygen out.
and what that does is make sure that the bacteria that grows to ferment it is actually good bacteria.
that 's like good for your intestinal track.
it does n't create bad anaerobic bacteria for you air.
tight this stuff will explode on you, once it starts to ferment, it will leak all over the place.
so make sure there is a bolt, underneath you in your ready to go.
this is been a bootleg tip on how to make kimchi so tune in next week.
and you 'll get another amazing bootleg tip without the red hand, see you soon.
