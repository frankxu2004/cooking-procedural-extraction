hi , everyone, and welcome to nigos, kitchens, fast food, friday.
today , we 're going to be making one of my personal favorite all-time fast foods, and it 's one of the most popular around the world, of course, i 'm talking about the famous fish and chips.
he 's got budget deals monday.
what you want wednesday far through friday, what else could he share.
is nigo, kitchenware?
satisfying meals are prepared.
so the first thing that we 're going to get started on our fish and chips is the batter for the fish.
so just into a bowl i 've got a sifter here and i 'm going to be sitting in some plain flour now.
the reason why i 'm sitting there flower is because i want a really crispy batter and the more air that i get into the better.
the more crispy it 's going to be now.
i 'm going to susan, the flower just with salt and make it a good helping of salt.
and of course, i 'm going to be adding in.
be a now the beer will not only add a great flavor to the better.
but those bubbles in the beer will also make the better really, really crispy, and just at that straight in now, just using a whisk very, very gently just mixed together the beer and the flower together.
so just mix it very lightly you still want to have all those air bubbles on the top, and you just want to mix you do n't wanna go any further than that.
now i want you to cover this with some plastic wrap, and i want you to leave it on the bench at room temperature for about half an hour.
so while we 're waiting for our backup we 're going to get started on our homemade tide air source, and there 's nothing better let me tell you, then homemade tidier source.
now just quickly i 've got some mayonnaise in here i have made and mayonnaise video before i will pop the link to that video in the description, or, you can just use some store, bought my nice for this that through the mine eyes, i 'm going to be adding in some gherkins that i 've just sliced up and just add them straight in.
next i 'm going to be adding in some capers that i 've just roughly chopped up.
next i 'm going to be adding in some parsley and lastly i 'm just going to put a small squeeze of some fresh lemon juice, and just give that a good mix and there you have it a nice quick homemade tire source.
so we 're going to start pulling out that on our fish in the first thing that we 're going to have to do just into a bowl i 've got some plain flour.
so guys this is the piece of fish that i 'm using i 'm using some snapper for this.
but you can use any piece of fish really this noise and things like that.
now all i 'm going to do with the fish here is just coat the fish in the flower and just dust off the excess flour now, bringing our better over on them going to put our fish straight in the better.
now what i want you to do just let that access battered rip off the fish.
now with some vegetable oil nice, and i 'm just going to put in our fish.
now with the vegetable oil you want to have it on medium to high heat for this, and the fish often need a rant about eight to ten minutes.
so it 's been about eight and a half minutes.
now guys, and you can see that beautiful golden brown crispy better on the outside.
so this is done i 'm going to turn the heat off and then we 're going to play this bad boy up niggas i have n't forgot about the chips are the potato chips.
now i 've done this recipe before i 've done these in the oven, it was one of my very, very first videos that i did and i will pop a link to that video below in the description and of course, it would n't be fish and chips without a slice of lemon on the side.
now all that fish is still hot, the last thing, the very last thing i 'm going to do is just put over some sea salt just over the top.
so let 's give this, a taste, and i 'm going to be using my hands i 'm just going to get off some of that better just.
so you can hear it snap just like that there 's.
so crunchy now i also just want to show the flesh inside, just look at that beautiful white fish that is the bomb right there, young, oh, and of course, not forgetting the chips, i 'm going to get some of that tire source on there oh , man.
if you do n't give this wanna go you are missing out.
