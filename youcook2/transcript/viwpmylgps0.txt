and they 're going to roast in the oven in the shell, which was kind of a really cool little trick.
you 'll see what happens after they come out just kind of distribute them around, pretty evenly.
next time in a season with some sea salt, cracked pepper.
some dried oregano.
and then when a good healthy lug of extra virgin olive oil.
this goes straight in the oven for fifteen minutes to one hour, these have been cooking, for about fifty minutes, and as you can see the tomorrow 's of really soften the garlic softap.

now for the hero that shibata only use half of it to put in this open for the other half we can actually make some.
crostini , which is like giant croutons, and you can just kind of really tear into this bring.
this up to a boil over high heat and immediately reduced to allow hate quick word to the wise on this dish.
because of the bread content in here this is a really thick soup, and as such, it can actually burn quite quickly.
so you do need to keep an eye on it and stir from time to time.
once it 's simmering away will keep their going for ten minutes, while the soups taking away.
we can use the rest of this bread here to make some crostini, which is italian for large crouton, which is french for large piece of toasted bread.
so i remove the label ghost lost that on the diagonal, but you can slice it any way you wish i 'm doing in.
about a centimeter thick, and we 'll take the griddle pan.
