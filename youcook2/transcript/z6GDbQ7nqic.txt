hey , everybody welcome to the wolfpit today, i 'm going to make an italian classic chicken parmesan.
but i 'm going to do it on the grill, so there 's no branding and no frying just lots of flavor.
it 's easy and it 's delicious, so let 's get started.
i 'm going to start by seizing my chicken and today.
i 'm using some boneless, skinless chicken breast, you can use bone in chicken or boneless, skinless chicken, thighs whatever kind of chicken will work in this recipe.
i 'm going to dress with extra virgin, olive oil salt, and pepper italian seasoning granulated.
garlic granulated onion and some crushed red pepper flakes.
now flip over and seizing the other side.
once there all season play some in the refrigerator for about an hour to marinate and today i 'm going to be using my napoleon four eighty five meraj gas grill.
the napoleon barrage four eighty five stainless steel gas grill has five burners for a total of seventy four thousand btus.
that 's three main burners one rear.
infrared burner for rotisserie cooking and one infrared sizzle zone side burner.
this gives you eight hundred fifteen square inches of total cooking area, and there 's some other features that really stand out for me.
one is the integrated cooler to where you can keep your condiments and drinks cold as well as an integrating cutting board.
and then you have the eye glow backlight technology.
how many times have you been growing at night, fiddling with the flashlight trying to see where your temperature set.
now all you have to do is hit a button and your knobs, illuminate now.
let 's go ahead and get the main burners lit one.
two and three and the infrared sizzle zone side burner to heat up some tomato sauce once the grill is preheated to three hundred fifty degrees i 'm going to go ahead, and sear, the chicken, off, for about three to four minutes per side after about five minutes, or tomato sauces come up to a simmer and.
now i 'm going to transfer it over to a pan to finish cooking the chicken in after about three minutes, i 'm going to go ahead and flip the chicken.
once it 's got some nice color to it, and after about six minutes or so, and it 's got some nice color on both sides i 'm going to go ahead and transfer the chicken breast over into the sauce.
once all the chicken is in the pan.
i 'm going to move the pan to the center of the grill, turn the center burner off and leave the two outside burners on low.
i 'm going to close the lid and cook this uncovered for about twenty minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through you do not want to over cook the chicken after cooking for another twenty minutes on low or chicken and sauce or done the chicken is beautiful.
it smells amazing, the sauce is thickened up a little.
now let 's get this played it up.
and there you have it grilled chicken parmesan without all the breading fat in calories.
but with all the flavor serve over top of the bed of spaghetti topped with lots and lots of parmesan cheese and enjoy if this looks like something you 'd like to try at home, please give me a thumbs up.
thank you all very much for watching.
i hope you give this a try and i 'll see you next time.
