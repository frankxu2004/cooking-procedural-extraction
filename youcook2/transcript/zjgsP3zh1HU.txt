well , our next guest jacking my cody grew up surrounded by authentic flavors of real italian cooking.
jacqueline , miconi is the author of celebrate italian style, and she 's here today.
jackie welcomed i so nice to see you again.
we should mention to you that your teacher and you 've got the day off.
i do teacher brent bailey.
right , yeah, we 're so happy to have you back.
let 's talk about what you 're teaching us to make today.
we 're going to be making penne, alla vodka yummy.
and this is this recipe.
that 's actually in your book, of course, i doctor it up a little bit.
you are not going to be giving away.
OK , that 's why i still want those are the ingredients.
where should we begin your recipe?
right now we have about a half a stick of butter that 's already melted.
we 're going to add about a quarter cup of extra virgin olive oil perfectly, then going to throw in that is prosciutto, and pancetta pursuit just about two slices all cut up and pancetta is italian bacon.
so we 're going to throw that right in let it start to brown up and turn it up a little bit and this is something i 'm sure anybody can kind of make yeah, it 's really easy it 's really easy it has, you know, a couple ingredients.
but you know, what if you let it simmer, and it 's good to go sounds good and how much do you recommend i have two cloves of garlic, two cloves of garlic out anything with garlic, OK yes beautiful.
but that there, and you 're going to learn it just kind of simmer a little bit, and you got some other spices working through these other spices i 'm just curious what we have here tomatoes i like the kind that 's an oil just.
because they 're a little bit easier to work with in a little bit easier to cut you can get the ones that are already just dried out those ones.
you 'll find me like the vegetable isle, but these ones would be with your marinated vegetables like marinated mushrooms, and that kind of stuff per fun.
so i have five of those, you can throw those right on in there are those in alabama.
i do n't know that i think of central tomato.
so i like that interesting twist with my little twist that 's right, then you 're going that 's a half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper, OK throw that in there, yeah, little spice.
and i have about two tablespoons of fresh parsley, and if you want to use dried you just use one tablespoon perfect, just rub it right.
and then we have one can of crushed tomatoes that would definitely alright here.
we go one candy crush made about it now.
dumping right in and are we cooking this medium heat kind of like right between low and medium and you want to keep it out of simmer and what you 're going to do is not going to fill it in the kitchen is fine.
right let this simmer for about fifteen to twenty minutes, so.
we 're going to put that aside, so we 're actually fast.
forwarding is we are fast forward to connecticut style so she knows, we had a fast for we are.
so we 're just going to let that get twenty minutes, and we have our.
next step which is we already have something that 's been simmering for a little bit.
and we 're going to get our creams in our vodka creams in our vodka.
and we need our half a cup for half a cup there.
we 're going to use a half a cup of everything perfect person.
so it would be pouring into half a cup of OK half a cup of heavy cream and this one is light cream.
OK half a cup of light cream alright.
and just dump that in the dump it in and then we have our half a cup of vodka that 's all put away.
so here we go, and we 're going to put that in there yeah, i could do it.
just gives it an extra flavor, i mean, this is n't.
this is n't like your classic italian dishes, now like when they came from centuries ago.
it 's a relatively new one to be honest.
my grandmother never made it was n't something that she made.
but it 's one of the newer in terms of italian cooking, but it 's whoever figured it out.
it 's pretty good.
she 's like i, i 'm in favor.
so now what do we, do we 're going to let that sit for about twenty minutes?
'cause you want the awful lot of cook off you do n't want to be taking bite fals of vodka.
so you want to let it simmer down and cook off, so, while we let that cook, we 're going to make some chicken cutlets perfect.
first thing we 're going to do.
we 're going to turn up the heat a little bit to get our oil.
going you can add a little bit more oil to that will be maybe about a quarter cup now.
i doctor up my bread crumbs what i have is about a cup and a half of season breadcrumbs.
OK , i had a half, a cup of parmesan cheese.
i have about two teaspoons of italian seasoning beautiful, and pepper, which ran to this side, there would go into a little bit of salt and pepper in this.
i 'm sure is kind of to taste, i mean, you can absolutely, absolutely and the chicken cutlets.
we 're just going to toss in there diplomatic first because we want the breadcrumb, cystic in this recipe.
we 're making it would feed how many this would definitely feed six to eight people.
oh , OK, they have small appetite.
so now we 've already dipped in there at both sides, both sides, and you 're going to put it in there, going to cook it in the, in the idea here, is in against were against the clock, the idea is we want to definitely make sure that it 's brown and cook nice round.
it takes about three minutes on each side.
you want thin cutlets, aici i buy the ones that are already in ice and trim because i spies having to cut off all the fat on the chicken.
so i get the ones that are already all nice and done for me or that, yeah, in there nice and thin.
so they 're much easier to cook with.
so why do we do this.
can you played up the one that you absolutely shipping this for probably at least have this 'cause we got a full house in?
here you got people waiting to bodies and without hairstyles here, and everybody wants to eat so i will let you play that up.
we 're going to get a shot of that in just a second.
