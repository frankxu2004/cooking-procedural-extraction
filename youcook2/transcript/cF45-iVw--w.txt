hi , welcome to eating more thrilla.
and today i 'm going to share with you, a delicious recipe from penny ala vodka.
it 's really easy and it 's quick to make it 's really not that bad.
and why do n't we get started so first thing you 're going to need is pending.
so up to very i would say take in pot of boiling water with salt boil, this amount.
and this is what will end up looking like, and it 's not like.
mushy , mushy, starchy i cooked it till i was not exactly out dent in a little bit more.
so it 's a little bit hard but not so starchy and mushy so it 's just the right texture.
what you 're going to need them is to begin is a half of a stick of butter, you going to put that in there, you 're going to melt that with one medium onion finely, chopped.
so i 'm going to put that in there and you are going to start occasionally for about five minutes OK.
so it 's been five minutes and this is what are onions look like with the butter are finally chopped onions.
and , you know, they 're not ground.
but they look nice and soft and yellow.
and now we 're ready to add our.
next ingredient which is a little bit less than one third of a cup of vodka.
so anybody you want to use you are going to let that simmer for about four five minutes.
so , now lower the heat just let it simmer.
so it 's been four minutes and as you can see you would expect there to be a lot more liquid with the onions.
but the vodka is pretty much all evaporated.
this is like a lot of the butter that was up from before, and now we 're going to add three corners of a cup of tomato puree.
not tomato paste and not tomato diced tomatoes.
tomato puree, to our recipe, and then we 're also going to add one cup of heavy cream.
stir that in all the ingredients together, and we 're just going to let that simmer now for five minutes.
this is so super.
easy , you know, you 're throwing it all your ingredients, basically, all the fit all that.
it is, is your taking time for each group of ingredients to meld in with one another and you add the.
next one and then you 're going to have his fantastic sauce in another few minutes wow.
so as you can see our sauce is now.
so in five minutes, and i 've let it simmer stirring it every once in awhile and it 's beautiful, beautiful red pink.
so now you 're going to have to add your final group of ingredients have a teaspoon of salt or more, i mean, it depends how salty you like your foods.
it 's all a matter of preference, a quarter teaspoon of black pepper or more.
if you like again and then for the last ingredient, which is tabasco i 'm going to add about three drops you can add more as much as you like you can.
just you know, put it in, and then you try it, and you see how it is.
so i 'm going to try it.
now for you guys, just to see very good.
but again, for those of you who like salt, you may like to have a lot more salt OK.
so now i 've got my pasta is cooked, or have my sauce.
everything is looking perfect.
here i 'm going to add my pasta sauce.
and i am going to stir everything in together, and the reason i did n't make the whole box of pasta, and i only did three quarters of the box is.
because i want there to be enough sauce for all of this penny here, and as, as you can see it 's looking good.
so this is what are pending.
olive vodka looks like absolutely beautiful and perfect and, i 'm sure it tastes that way too.
let 's see, very good really hope to enjoy it, and i hope you 'll let me know what you think if you try it, and i hope to see you again on eating with rula bye , bye.
