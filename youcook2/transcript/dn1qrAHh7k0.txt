hi , everyone, this is the lighthouse lady today.
i 'm going to make a grilled cheese sandwich.
i like to use frozen honey wheat bread today.
i 'm going to use provolone cheese.
sometimes i use sharp cheese american cheese.
it 's all a matter of choice, ansome smart balance buttery spread.
i like to butter the bread rather than put the butter in the pan.
it seems to cover the bread better that way and the reason why i used frozen bread, it takes a little longer for the bread to cook, and that way the cheese melts also place one slice of bread in the pan.
so i 'm going to use three of these thin slices of provolone.
i like to flip it over just as the butter starts to melt to the other side.
it also gives the cheese time to start to melt on each side.
how do you make your grilled cheese?
well , there it is looks mighty tasty to me.
thanks for watching.
