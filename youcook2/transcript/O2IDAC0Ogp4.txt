i know you start smelling bacon cooking, and you think is it breakfast time.
but in our house, it could be lunch or dinner, especially if we 're making this amazing pasta dish, spaghetti carbonara, which is one of our all time favourites in our family.
i 'm starting by cutting four strips of bacon or five, depending on the size.
you can see how wide this end is and how narrow this is so where it 's wide.
i just cut it in half and then just cut.
oh , about half inch pieces.
this is a dish that at any given time, as been miles favorite dish luke 's favorite dish, and i can tell you that when i come home from a long day at work, and i have no time and this can cook pretty much in the amount of time that it takes to cook the pasta is like the ultimate comfort food for me i 've heated my pan.
i 'm pulling the bacon right in there should be, enough back here to prevent it from sticking.
but if you have any concerns about that whynot at another fact it 's a good fat olive oil, and just sprinkle a little bit over that.
the pasta is boiling away.
i put it in trying to time it perfectly.
it should cook for about eight to ten minutes and just let it boil way i always salt my water for my pasta.
that 's really important now.
here 's a put.
the S and simple for this dish i have, my final possible here.
and i 'm just going to break three eggs right in and what 's happening here.
this is going to create the kind of creamy sauce without cream.
because once the heat of the pasta hits the final possible.
that 's going to be just enough to cook the eggs without really making them scrambled.
so one cup of parmesan cheese and fresh parmesan and chunk ca n't be beat for this because the flavor so amazing.
but if you buy yours already, graded that 's fine, too.
whatever works for you and gets you in the kitchen cooking, so there are maybe.
that 's a little more than a couple that 's OK, bacon is sizzling away.
this just gets scrambled with the cheese give a good great of pepper.
we 're almost there.
so you can see how a twelve year old would really be able to make this mix it up, and really make sure that you combine ma cheese with the egg alright.
let 's check the bacon.
i would say just a few more seconds, but that 's perfect 'cause i 'm going to taste the pasta.
always make sure your pasta is in good shape before you finish your dish.
all right perfect firm not too soft not too hard.
now i am going to put this pasta straight into the pot.
whi , well, i want to create a little bit of sauce with the liquid alright.
those burner is turned off.
i 'm just going to get the last little bit of pasta, so i just want to stir this around a bit.
the fat from the bacon mixes with that hot liquid.
and , creates an actual sauce.
OK now what has happened over here is we have.
i know raw eggs, but the minute this warm pasta hits this.
it 's going to start to cook.
but not too fast it just going to cream together.
so all come back to this in a second.
but i just want to get it mixing.
so i do n't over put these eggs and it just starts to make a beautiful creamy sauce, oh, no, this is exactly the way it supposed to look.
you 'll be able to serve, oh, i do n't know.
four to six people, when you just get the rest out of the pot.
give it ago, if it 's the first time you 've ever cooked pasta dish, you were going to be successful with this one, and everybody is going to love you for it.
i 'm going to give it a little taste ca n't help myself.
