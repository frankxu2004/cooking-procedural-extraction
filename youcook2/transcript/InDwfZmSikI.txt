somebody teach you how to make a classic neapolitan pizza margherita.
have a neapolitan dough, no sugar, no oil in this dough recipe?
we 're going to hand stretch this to about twelve inches.
we 're going to use a san marzano tomato and these are certified.
san marzano, SDLP from the companion region of italy.
now , i have the fresh motorola grande.
this is a four ounce silver, lini.
i want to pinch this off.
i 'm going to grab some sea salt when i go around in a circular motion like that, pick up some basil now.
the basel is going to go on before, usually when you make a pizza you put the basil on afterwards.
but when we go into a nine hundred degree oven for about ninety seconds that 's really traditionally what a neapolitan pizza would be like we have our olive oil.
we 're going to go ahead and start in the middle, go in a circular motion like that, finish it.
now grab our peel, fix our pizza on our peel.
i 'm go ahead and launch that into the other now.
this should cook in about ninety seconds.
the floor is about eight hundred and fifty closest to the fire is about nine hundred.
the dome is a thousand degrees.
you see, my bottoms trying pretty well, it 's pretty much almost complete.
we 're pretty much good.
i 'm going to pull this up.
so you guys can see how that 's bubbling.
now is about ninety seconds.
i really wanted a dome.
it could dome it, but it 's so hot that pizza is coming out system.
