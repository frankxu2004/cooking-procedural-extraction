welcome to my kitchen.
today , i 'm going to show you how to prepare pumpkin period.
we would call them pierogies, danion, an i thought right.
now with thanksgiving it would be nice to make a polish pirogue with a little bit of thanksgiving twists, the taste is a little bit different.
so not everyone will like it.
but if you do like pumpkin or pumpkin spice you 're going to love them i 'm guessing all right.
so let 's have a look at the ingredients, then.
what you need in case you decide to give it a try.
i am something with my only, and i 'm going to chop it very finely and make sure it 's really funny.
because you do not want to feel the onion in your P raleigh and then the.
next step is to commit caramelizing onions on the francs hand, and added some vegetable oil.
i walked it up and i heated up actually and.
now i 'm adding my onions, and i 'm going to be cooking them for around four five minutes create mixing from time to time.
they need to get glossy and soft here.
we go and then into my, into my mixing bowl.
i 'm adding pumpkin puree ahead, and my recorder cheese pumpkin spice, i 'm adding a whole piece from better.
if you do n't like it that much, just at half of the teaspoons is going to be perfectly.
OK , OK, i 'm checking for seasoning adding, my onions, and then i 'm going to add some salt and pepper and.
now time to mix it some more check for seasoning again and everything needs a little bit more.
and then, the mining my breath pumps day after that is the final mix.
have everything well incorporated?
and then we have it ready so we can put it aside.
i 'm going to cover it with the ceramic grabs, and right now it 's nice to prepare the dog.
i am transferring my flowering to my food processor going to add a teaspoon of sold and then in that mark there.
you see, i boiled water, it 's not hot anymore, but it 's still very warm.
i 'm going to post it a little bit, just to mix this salt and flour together OK and then it 's time to start adding slowly the water and.
now we watching what happens with our flower when slowly adding the water.
because the moment the flower starts forming a dull with the water that you can see a ball going around in your food processor that means it 's enough, i added here around three quarter of a cup.
but everytime flower is different.
so it can vary, it can be once happen.
can be more than a cap and then when this is done, you want to go for another minute or so?
now in the large board and put in water adding one teaspoon of salt and bring it to boil, while we work on our parochial OK, when you work a few more time, you need your though you will see that it 's very elastic.
and it stops being sticky, very quickly now, if it is a little bit sticky just add a little bit more flower to your surface and as you can see we rolling and flipping rolling and flipping.
now we want to roll it to really thin layer.
i would say one two millimeters, it also depends on what you like.
because i notice my mom is my liking them very thin, just making them a little bit thicker.
i like them somehow in the middle.
now on the plate, imputing some flower.
because i 'm going to be putting ready pierogi before they go to ball, and i do n't want them to stick to my place and then with the glass.
i 'm going to be cutting out circles.
OK , here we go this done now.
i 'm bringing my staffing and covering it now and now, all those leftovers, which i 'm picking up right now.
i 'm going to form a ball out of them and put them in a zip lock bag.
so they do n't dry out.
so i can roll them again and have few more character.
and right now very important party when you pick up the door, you want to flip it as you saw i flipped it.
because the part, which was sticking to their table it 's going to be much easier to stick to each other to close the pirogue, and not open them.
so they do n't open in the water.
and now we wanna, press it on the edges and another important tip for this.
is do n't put too much stuffing because if the staffing goes on the edge of the perogy again?
they will not close or they will open, while boiling sometimes if they would dry too much.
my mom says she 's keeping a little shot glass of warm water, and she 's dipping her finger to make the edge so the basic better.
but i did n't have that problem.
here we go and now here, that is, my husband and he bought me this little machine for making paragon.
he 's showing me how to use it is actually cute.
we 've put stand, oh, inside.
then we put he 's putting out quarter of a tablespoon there in that machine when i 'm doing it with my hands.
i was put in the land around half a tablespoon, which is not much for, for a pirogi.
but this staffing it 's pretty soft, and that 's why when i 'm making a meet.
pirogi , uruski, the one with cheese and potatoes, which the recipes are coming very soon, so stay tuned, get on the tablespoon of, of staffing OK here.
we go he does.
it again adam very nice.
they look more professional with the little machine.
and then when my parochial ready and putting them into the boiling water i put the heat to a little bit lower, just.
so they do n't bubble too much, and then very gently steer them with the wooden spoon.
i do n't want them to stick to the bottom, OK.
then we have non stick spray on the play, and we waiting for all the P rocky to float up to the surface and when this happens and keeping it for another boiling and then fishing them out here.
we go OK and.
now time to spray them on the top again with nonstick spray, you can do it like this, or my mommy 's just using a brush in the oil K.
we serve them just from the water with sour cream, or you can fry them if you would like to.
i hope you enjoyed this recipe and let me know what you think.
and i will see you next time happy thanksgiving.
