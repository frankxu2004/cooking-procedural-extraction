and some of you have commented to say that we do n't do enough good.
traditional british food, which is why this week we jumping straight in a classic and that 's fish and chips.
so we 're going to make our own chips twice right.
and we 've got some haddock, which we 're going to put into a beer batter.
could n't get anymore british?
the first thing, that is our chips, so, if you guys can wanted people and wanted to chip, you 're making a little clean up in a minute jamie.
i 'm just saying it 's on the hub jamie now.
we want chips now for this one.
we 're going to quite thin chips in slices like this is more like french fries.
really french fries.
so it 's completely against the point spot when you see when we try to find it.
you 'll notice why we do that like this.
is a nice crispy chips?
you can leave some skin on if you want.
but for these, i think it 's even better if we take it off while you 're doing that.
i 'm going to make our pastor so.
it 's just an all purpose flour or plain flour it assault.
and then we 're going to make it with his our AO tails are very british, very british drugs.
are good , IO?
no strings staying flat.
it 's beautiful, perfect in this battle, which one of you got there.
this is bishops finger really is.
we 've had a few bishops finger in my time.
now here in the UK will well known for a stupid tail names, if you want to see more outrageous names and click on the description below inspiration video, you want a consistency is going to stick to the fish.
so something like that it 's, it 's still dripping.
but it 's nice and thick and lump.
free is important dripping bishops ring back, and they can go into our fryer.
ask out how that 's, that 's a chipped everyone.
i cut yep, device about same size.
yeah , or i have a storage complex, and i think they probably questions.
so these go into oil hundred forty degrees going to cooking twice that 's not for oil that 's quite cool.
you can do this just in a pan on the stove.
if you like just keeping on it never leave it unattended.
and they will cook for about five minutes.
meanwhile , we can do our fish so the batteries there now there is one other secret.
ingredient a little bit of this in the batter that 's tablespoon safe.
and that 's just enough to give it a crunch if you do n't want to use beer.
you ca n't get hold of beer, you can just use sparkling water, is another alternative now those chips probably cooked?
but i left them out, misshape get rid of excess oil and then drain them on kitchen.
roll is once cooked that 's once cooked.
but you can see already may be cooked, cooked fry up to one hundred eighty degrees 'cause that 's what we 're going to cook.
are fishing, and i will start actually better in the fish, so this is havoc cave?
like sustainable fish, make sure you 've taken all the skin off.
and it is bone free season flower.
and that 's just going to make the batter stick to the fish and then bars.
if you can just kind of throw that in there, and after coordinates all codes and then and just slowly lower in.
so it starts at set the battle before you let go similar to the whole things coated slowly in.
so we get last minute and then gift basket a little bit machine, and it just stops sinking to the bottom.
so they need about five minutes.
then they can come out and the chips and go back in touchdown ban co.

so those out just let them drain a little bit.
very noisy popular fishing channels dude nice crispy pastor and then if our chips go boom there, jamie, 'cause.

maybe ninety seconds to crisp up meme all over this site.
we can start plating the rest sizes now another classic british thing.
always there fish and chips in newspaper here on it.
sorry often nice bigger efficient there more classic components.
but our source says that 's mayonnaise capers, gherkin nice wedge of lemon and how those chips coming on jamie, they should n't need much longer.
i think of that crispy, crispy, nice and crystal clear in the monster kitchen roll, and we get my spring season at this stage that stick to the oil slightly smells of the seaside task smells and sounds like a seaside.
there was stuff some of our chips in there, yep plenty inside.
so for everyone who is after something conditionally british it 's our beer battered haddock and chips sorted.
