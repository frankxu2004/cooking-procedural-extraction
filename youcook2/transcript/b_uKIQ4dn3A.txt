i 'm going to show you how to make prevo guy.
we send EO put minutes fire.
cookie means meat, so the made cooked on the fire like direct from the fire is blue believe that is, where the name come from.
but nowadays, people guy is a career signature magnate meat that you could n't.
either stove or the grill or however you look so the first we are going to make revoke is soft so what you need bike spokes tablet.
and if the missing, well, and i 'm going to use a helper larger size on young, very disney slice i make will be.
so many times in tire of my life, and i ground up the onion in the stars or just no onion analyzers adding later whenever i start fry, but, actually thinly sliced onions in the sauce is best.
and i will add a little bit of green onions curve one into long pieces, and if you 're using little more tickle green on your coded have limp wise.
i need a little bit over asia pair.
i really like a pear flavor in my brew coffee sauce and actually it tenderize the meat as well if you do n't have it, or you cannot find a sham pair.
you can skip it.
you still can make it without it.
i 'm just going to grand am, i pair in my disc special grounder abound in the kitchen store somewhere other remember exactly.
but if you do n't have this, obviously you can use this cheese grater than working perfect ground, either diahanne or, sapirs or other fruits into the sauce perfect over here two tablespoons of ground pair, flavorful vegetables and tenderizers are in my mixing board.
i 'm going to put all the sources, i 'm using champions can jam this sources guys limit area.
it 's probably the best soy sauce is amazing.
so you will need to dictate expense of the sample source, source suck it and one paper stern of nearing seasoned rice wine.
do you do n't have a soccer?
you can use red wine.
actually , dry, red wine will work great on the global resources, well.
two tablespoons of sugar, one tablespoon of good quality system.
the oil and participant of salt and participant of black it and half davis villanova sesame E seeds.
but i wanna make sure the sources or corporated together first and i 'm going to add a one pound of rib eye and this is actually from korean store they could revive bowl revoir key, which is very difficult, and everybody is actually commonly used for the low key in korea, so, if you can apply this myth and i understand.
because i 've been in the place that where i can buy this kind of cut of meat or an even though i ask a future, they would n't do it.
because i guess is like extra work to do it.
so i understand is a hard to get in some places what you can do, is purchase a chunk of a revive, an freeze.
it in the fridge are about one hour to two hours now all the way through, we just try to freeze it the outside part of the rib eye.
so it 's easily cut, and just mix everything together, catholic as the beep meat is breakdown welcome over here.
