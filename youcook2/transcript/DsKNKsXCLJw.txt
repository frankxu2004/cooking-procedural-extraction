thanks to all recipes member.
kathleen burton, for submitting this, roasted garlic, mashed potatoes.
recipe , one member claims.
i 'm never making regular mashed potatoes again and another member says this was absolutely wonderful.
i do n't know why i do n't make my mashed potatoes like this all the time.
we love these.
let 's begin this recipe by roasting the garlic preheat.
the oven to three hundred and fifty degrees place the garlic on a sheet of aluminum foil.
drizzle the garlic with a tablespoon of olive oil, then wrap it with the foil bake, the garlic in the preheated oven for about an hour or until it 's tender meanwhile, peel two pounds of medium russet potatoes, you can also use uconn gold potatoes if you like cut them into quarters put the potatoes into a large pot.
cover them with cold water by at least an inch and add a generous pinch of salt.
bring the water to a boil over medium high heat reduce the heat and simmer the potatoes until they 're tender when pierced with the tip of a knife.
about fifteen minutes drain the potatoes.
transfer them to a large bowl.
add four tablespoons of softened butter, a half cup of heated milk, so that it does n't bring down the temperature of the potatoes and salt and ground.
black pepper to taste, remove the garlic from the oven, an unwrap.
it cut across the top of the head of garlic, exposing the clothes.
squeeze the garlic cloves into the potatoes discarding the skins blend the potatoes with an electric mixer on low speed until their mashed to the desired consistency, serve the potatoes hot topped with butter and a sprinkling of salt and pepper.
if you happen to be a real garlic lover, you may want to roast two heads of garlic for these mashed potatoes as several members have suggested.
