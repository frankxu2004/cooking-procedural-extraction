today , we 're going to be making corn dogs.
some people call them pogos like in canada.
some people call them batter francs, here are the ingredients that we 're going to need one cup of flour.
one and a half teaspoons of baking powder, a half a teaspoon of salt, four tablespoons of cornmeal three tablespoons of oil, one egg and three quarters of a cup of milk, so.
let 's get started.
the first thing that we want to do it is cracker egg open and then we 're going to grab ourselves a bowl and get our milk in there, and then popular again and get.
that all nicely whisk together alright.
let 's get the rest of the ingredients in.
let 's get the salt in.
and all of our flower and get that nicely incorporated.
next will pop in the oil mix that in nicely and then our baking powder and our last ingredient will put in is the corn meal, and i like to let this batter sit for a good ten minutes.
so that the baking powder starts to activate in the batter.
OK , so you want your oil between three hundred and sixty in three hundred and seventy, five degrees also always make sure that the handle of your pot is pointing towards the wall.
you do n't want to have any accidents.
all right, so we 've got our hot dogs already to go.
we 've got our batter.
and we 've got somewhere to actually drain the corn dogs.
when they 're ready so, all i 've done is basically taken hot dogs and i 've cut them in half.
and i put little sticks into the one end of the hot dog.
so we 're going to grab.
are hot dog.
and we 're going to dip it into the batter, and you really want to get all of the hotdog totally covered in the batter and then gently place it into the oil.
and when i try to do is kind of, hold it.
so that it does n't touch the bottom of the pot just for a couple of seconds and what that does.
is it creates a little coding on the corn dog?
and then it does n't stick to the bottom so you can see me doing that here and then.
finally , drop it there.
we go so.
let 's do it again into the batter twisted around trying to get the batter all over and then.
gently put it into the oil, always remember to gently place things in oil.
you do n't want you do n't want to drop it in quickly because it will splash up on you, let 's try it again.
here we go.
and then let go so these corn dogs are almost ready to come out.
i 'm looking for a nice golden brown color.
i never actually time how long.
they 're in there.
i look at the colour and when the colors really nice and golden brown, then i take them out now.
i 'm just going to drain them, so let 's train them and now.
let 's start the process again now.
i 've zoomed the camera in a little bit and change the angle.
so that we can actually see closer, what i 'm actually doing here.
so i 'm right now.
i 'm dipping it into the oil, so here 's a close-up of me, coding the corn dog, and then i put it into the oil.
i 'm just showing you different angles of all of the process, alright, so here 's our second batch.
and they 're ready to go.
so let 's get them out and drain them and here, we have our final product yummy corn dogs.
you can serve them up with mustard, like i have here or you can also eat them with ketchup, kids seem to love ketchup.
i love mustard, but any which way you like it, that 's the way to go.
do n't worry about the hotdog being thoroughly cooked, when it 's in the fryer that long and when it gets golden brown like this on the outside the hotdog is fully cooked on the inside?
so , do n't worry about that at all?
anyway , try out this recipe and let me know how it turned out.
so that 's it for this video, so i 'll see you next time.
