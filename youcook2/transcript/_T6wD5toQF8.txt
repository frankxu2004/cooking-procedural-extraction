waldorf , salad with roast chicken very simple and delicious.
the great thing is it takes five minutes to make you do n't see very often now.
but when i was a boy, and i started in the trade it was all the menus.
but with rose chicken is delicious, it 's a nice alternative.
it 's very simple.
celery , walnuts and apples.
today , i 'm using hellmann 's mayonnaise.
but then, i add nor touch of taste, which gives you that nice roast chicken flavor with the apples in this area in the walnuts and the rose chick in delicious.
so you take your salary you can see, see what i 'm doing i 'm just cutting into matchsticks not necessary you can just chop it up and just one of those people who likes to make work for myself as you can see.
i 'm just from my knife through the celery and cut into the matchsticks again do n't allow.
recipes dictate type two sticks of celery into match lips as you can see.
it 's not perfect.
but it 's sort of quite elegant and.
now i 'm going to take two apples.
so what we do with the apples again turn them into mastics again , devils.
i 'm using a granny smiths.
they might prefer apple for waldorf.
it does n't have to be perfect when you 're chopping your salary in your apples.
you do n't have to turn them into match.
teams like i do.
i 'm quite confident with a knife so it 's easy for me.
but if your life skills are n't that great just shop, so they do n't have it.
my matchsticks salary in granny smith apple, then we take the least.
the celery robin waste them just chop them and, using like a hub in the summer, just makes it a little bit of lemon juice and just mix it in to stop the authorization now.
here 's our mayonnaise and a tiny little bit.
not touch your taste flavor.
they can treated like addressing rather than so it stays quiet lights.
i just not too much just like dressing as towers.
sometimes you get coleslaw which is so thicker walled off, which is so thick.
gotta retain that freshman so just for the offspring without breaking your apples in your salary OK little walnuts on the bottom rather mixon inside again.
i 'd like to build my layers of flavor and texture as soon as you can see it slightly dressed, then we take our chicken as you can see here.
remove the breast from the chicken.
now , many ways of carving a chicken.
let 's go with the grain make it very fine and if you do n't say your chicken breasts off the bone like myself just take it off in chunks.
you cut the legs in.
half serve whole breasts.
your choice make life easy.
just enjoy it wo n't taste any different ranger chicken with a salad and then the chicken work fantastically get together well and take some walnuts, just be clear walnuts at the top and then just take some herb.
i 'm using costly.
and then we have a waldorf salad with roast chicken waldorf salad, without question, is where the great salads it works, well, with many things.
so if you do want to roast a whole chick in like i have and certainly this salad, that is, a great sunday supper dish if you got some roast pork left from lunch, waldorf, salad if you 've got some roast chicken roast turkey it works delicious lee, well, but, having said all that, it 's just nice night saying.
