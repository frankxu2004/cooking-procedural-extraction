vacation cooking, you talk of oz made simple.
this is what we need bell peppers onion.
mushroom beef olive oil spices, song pepper from the wife, and of course, skewers two simple stages cut it up, marinate it.
let it sit throw it on the barbeque kiss maine dice up your mushrooms.
special note do n't dice your onion into thin ring, hugs to cut your onion like this.
nice big onion chunk veggies marinating in here.
steak mary in here butter spices olive oil spices, melting the butter for the steak salt.
garlic crushed red pepper.
if you like that spice, we 're going to let this marinate for about an hour olive.
oil pepper salt parsley, minced onion crushed, red pepper spice.
we 're using spices loaded in this condo were staying in.
flip it around the bowl not large enough for this mission.
wash your hands apply more these are good to go.
i 'm going to put these marinate these along with the meat for an hour.
so we 'll see you alright time to assemble are, kabobs without the veggies.
we got the beef, you got the skewers, we got everything we need now.
this would be considered the art form recognizing that your freedom and creativity is entirely one hundred percent, up to you want a mushroom to be next.
would you like a piece of beef to be next, would you like a yellow pepper and a red pepper and not to reds in the same order?
now we want a little bit of spacing for flame broiled.
but we can stack it up.
we 're going to fill out the rest like these, and then we 're going to throw on the grill.
i 'll write our kabobs already.
so let 's get the grill fired up and get these things barbecue in alright.
so a grill is, he did not know this that some details medium to high heat on the grill.
make sure there 's some space between each of the items.
so that the heat can fully cook the meat and vegetables, tell them for about ten minutes, turning as needed.
so that the meat is fully cooked and the vegetables are tender.
so i 'm going to make sure everything spaced out good on here.
kabob travel alright, we 're on slightly down from fully high heat, or else heated up here.
we go about ten minutes from this point on alright.
i 'm going to leave the lid open so that we can let some heat escape and just let the flame broil happen on the bottom.
a little bit of extra of the butter and spice that i had a meat.
so that i can just kinda give it a little five over here.
so we just flip them as you can see this piece right here at cooking nicely.
and we 're using we 're getting a little bit of flame broiled going on.
because of using some of the, the remaining marinade, tripping it on there, there we go wow pretty good, you know, we lost an onion here.
we can probably salvage it, but as all things go there 's casualties in war.
so , i mean, that 's just life.
my wife likes it a.
little medium, slightly who cook pretty much through leaving hers on a little bit longer, but, you know, cook your meat to the temperature and amount of doneness that she would prefer there.
you have it simple and easy kebabs cooked to a few different doneness.
i cook these longer.
because my wife likes for meat, done this a little bit of pink in the middle on this one.
because that 's how i like it.
and i 'm going to probably eat all three of these and that she will have this one, and.
so anyways, just threw this together with some of the stuff.
we could find here at condo on a vacation summer, cooking the candles, kabobs.
and we 've logged on this channel, so subscribe for just kind of a few blogs a week, and occasionally cooking videos.
alright , well, here 's our final result.
action going on.
