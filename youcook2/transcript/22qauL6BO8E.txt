i first cut it in half.
sometimes they have this teeth right here.

it cut like this, so i get all my catid, calamari.
and i put it in a strainer and leave it in there for a few minutes.
now we was really, really good with plenty of water.
we 're going to add one teaspoon of baking soda powder in there, and we 're going to mix it really good, now, what the soda does.
this so that makes it way easier to cook, and gives a better taste afterwards.
but who you are going to leave it like that with a soda, at least for ten minutes, and then you are gonna wash, it really, really, really good.
three four times otherwise, if the soda remain in the calamari it will give you united state.
now we watched it.
then , we added enough salt, either others much as you want.
so you guys are gonna show, you a way to flower the calamari without waste any flower and without do a huge mess in the kitchen.
so you get a plastic bag you put flower in there, and you put the calamari in also, put some flower on the top and just work the product like that, that way you are going to flower it way more easy instead of flowering base pipis let it right here in order to fry the calamaria right you 're gonna need a lot of corn oil.
so you kinda deep fry them and you 're gonna need high temperature.
