i 've got a three hundred thirty mil bottle of great australian beer, about it, a cup and three quarters.
you could use lemonade, you could use fizzy water.
whatever really whichever you prefer i really like a beer batter.
and you see that it 's going to prop up and aerate the batter nicely, just going to use a whisk.
now and bring this up to a nice thick batter.

but two teaspoons of sugar that will make your batter lovely and crisp i 've got one teaspoon of garlic powder and a couple of teaspoons of salt.
we continue to wish this together, now seasoning is very important.
i 'm going to be building a little black pepper into here.
tip , number one taste, your batter.
if your batter taste bland it ai n't going to taste any better when you fry it.
so make sure you 've got all the seasoning just right so we 're setting a batter aside and prepare onions.
tip , number two and no.
it does n't matter whether you use red brown or white onions.
they 're all absolutely.
delicious do n't cut your onions.
so thin if we use skinny little onion rings like this you 're going to end up with just better and no flavor cut your onion rings about a centimeter, a half an inch wide, it will make wonderful onion rings.
and you can take the outer skin off after you 've cut them.

celsius or three seventy five fahrenheit.
if it 's too hot, they 'll burn if it 's too cold that just get all soggy and when the oil is the perfect temperature.
we can just lift those onion rings.
an if you 've got, the tongues you can just drop them in for a few seconds hold them and then just drop them and let go and just take a second one in there, and just hold it by holding them with their tongues, and just letting them in slowly they start to crisp up.
and they wo n't all stick together now using my secondary tongues and going to let these cook for one and a half minutes.
i 'm going to flip them over and cook them for another one and a half minutes.
