i 'm going to show you how to make the easiest how much you have ever, ever made.
if there is one fresh recipe that you must keep in your refrigerator in your cooking arsenal, it is super easy hummus.
the recipe is in re licious lunches.
i am going to show you how to make it, though.
so simple, we 're going to take a can of drinks, drinks, rin and drained chickpeas, chickpeas are great 'cause they 're packed with protein.
put them right in going to put in some lemon juice.
that 's what gives hummus that really great zip you could totally buy hummus.
but i promise you the fresh, homemade taste is really worth the six ingredients that go into this one small garlic clove, and i think you probably think, oh, garlic, clove young kids.
i do n't know my kids.
both love garlic going to add some salt here, always just to finish off that flavor.
and tahini you can find tahini, natsu peanut butter or almond butter at your grocery store.
it 's sesame E paste and this is one of the first recipes that i ever made for my kids.
because when they were toddlers, you know, they want soft foods, easy foods to eat hummus perfect for that in the wizard, up give it just a little buzz alright through chopped up for just a second we 're going to add in some oil about a third of a cup just to loosen it up make it nice and creamy.
and i 'd like to serve this either pita chips or carrots and celery.
sometimes right before dinner for school lunch i 'll put it into a rap sandwich.
i know you probably do n't believe me, but how easy is that so simple this really is a great recipe to get your kids making with you.
but it 's minor.
i 'm going to, you know, sit here some lunch by myself got purple shoes and more fast, fresh and easy recipes like this.
