welcome to huffington.
post my name is thea random.
this is my recipe for the weekend now.
i 'm going to cook today.
we get the carbonaro which i think is one of those dishes that everyone has a sort of theory or philosophy behind an for main most important thing about spaghetti carbonaro is the quality of the ingredients.
so really good quality spaghetti, i mean, by the sort of the best spaghetti, you can afford to buy good eggs, i mean, these are italian eggs and the chickens are being fed a diet of corn and carrots, and there specifically for pastor 'cause we got this amazing yolk.
because of the carrot in macara it 's very, very almost orange life and then i got some really good quality pancetta which is a dry cures, not smoked, it 's got this kind of amazing amount of fat on it.
but when you fry it is absolute.
and then of course, we 're going to have some parmesan, i mean, you could use a pecorino.
but harm is an with the egg and the pancetta is delicious.
there 's no cream in this recipe, carbonaro, with cream is how it should be done putting black pepper as well, so, first of all, we get a hot pan or actually.
first , will cook a spaghetti, so, the whole dish should n't take longer than the spaghetti cook.
now this is probably going to take on the packets about ten minutes.
i will look up at eight, and we 're just going to finish up the cooking with a bit of the cooking water and the eggs in a pan.
cheddar and parmesan so will put this in now.
so , while that 's cooking, we 're going to get a punch header.
so nice thin strips of pancetta and they 're nice hot pam ended any oil in the pan.
because this is not.
so much fat this pancetta and we want to make it kind of dry and crispy.
so and it goes to hope.
and , and they just get that.
pull out facts instead of render out.
and while that 's going on we 're going to separate are eggs.
unique color of egg in this for one portion.
i do at least two yolks and wants a horse, i mean, a sort of small starter portion, so make sure snow white in there just the yolk two.
they 're quite small.
sort of do three.
so three yolks keep the whites with something else.
and then just keep in mind that pancetta we 'd only two going to be black twist on the nice golden color, and i 'm really quickly.
look at much fat comes out.
it 's incredible, but there 's so much flavor and the kind of the fatty, the pancetta user.
the crisper it goes and just put that so it 's how drain off any excess fats and everyone that fast anymore, statics purpose.
so just going to beat off.
they go together at little seasoning black pepper.
just wait for our spaghetti to cook, so we can take our pass right now.
i could so nice chewiness to it.
so add it to our season egg yolks with a bit of that cooking water, do n't worry about getting rid of cooking water in?
and then using the hot pasta start, moving the eggs and the pastor together and the hot pasta will cook me a joke.
let 's wait any cream, and we had some parmesan cheese user pork views tongues.
you get all the nice bits stuck in the tongue so this user fork.
and then this point it started with thick, add some other pastoral cooking water.
so pasta cooking water and then instead of bring that altogether add the pancetta leave some for the top and then it was like a nice little bit of good olive oil in there as well, get all those nice bits on the side and then nice small portion the carbonaro more pancetta little bit more parmesan.
and i just finished off with a little bit more beautiful black pepper, there.
you have a delicious authentic spaghetti, carbonaro.
