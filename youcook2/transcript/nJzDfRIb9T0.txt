hello , this is chef john from food wishes, dot com with beef goulash that 's right.
i 'm using an old wolfgang puck recipe of this amazing beef stew and while he 's not hungarian, he is austrian and since i never been to that part of europe.
i 'm going to assume that pretty much the same thing and while i really do n't know if that 's true, what i do know is if there was a beef stew hall of fame.
this would have an entire wing dedicated to it, it 's that amazing so here 's how you do it.
first , we 're going to cut up some beef chuck do not buy stew meat yourself get the cheapest hunk of beef chuck, you can find, and just cut it up in like fork size pieces.
and you see all that connective tissue.
that 's why this is so delicious.
it 's also why it takes a couple hours to simmer, but totally worth it.
and of course, the other reason i want to cut your own is because when you buy pre cut from the market those are the pieces.
they literally ca n't sell any other way, and you 're paying extra for the privilege.
so just cut your own.
it 's really easy.
once you cut it up, we 're going to go ahead and season that with some salt and black pepper going to spread that out and do it right on the board give that a toss season.
we 're going to see that in brown that for a few minutes on each side in a very hot skillet with a little bit of vegetable oil on high heat going to do half at a time.
i do n't want to crowd it.
i want a nice brown on there right as they brown.
i 'm just going to toss him right into my stewpot.
OK , i 'm going to add in the second batch.
and once all your beef chunks are browned, we 're going to go ahead and saute onions.
and we 're going to use the exact same pan.
why waste all that delicious.
so put that back on medium heat.
add in your onions that i very roughly chopped nice big pieces.
styx , too, and rustic.
if you check the chef to english dictionary means do not spend a lot of time on the precision cuts.
just whack that thing up at to the pan with a little drizzle of olive oil big pinch assaults and going to cook that for five or six minutes.
i do n't need to cook it all the way through this is going to simmer for a couple hours.
but i do want to get the edges nice and golden brown that 's going to some beautiful sweetness and color to this, do sewing transfer onions into the stewpot and once again do not, do not wash that pan.
because we 're going to toast the spices in there.
so just set the pan aside, while you prep your spices spaces in goulash is caraway and there they are little caraway seeds, i'ma throw a couple teaspoons in a mortar and, pestle and crush it up.
you could use a spice grinder, but it was just a little bit.
so , that 's an easy way to do it.
i 'm going to dump my ground caraway seeds into our drive, but still, dirty pen along with some pep, rica hopefully it 's hungarian.
but if you have to use spanish paprika no problemo, i 'm going to send some black pepper some dry marge room.
some dry time and some cayenne, i 'm going to put the heat on medium and i 'm going to post those spices in the dry pan for about it 's.
but do n't necessarily go by time you want to keep stirring moving it around the pan until you can just sort of barely smell that caraway seed toasting.
we certainly do n't want to burn these spices, but we do want to wake him up with that heat.
it really does make a difference.
so , after three or four minutes, a toasting i decided more perfect.
i 'm gonna deglaze with a cup of chicken broth that 's going to stop the cooking process, and of course, release, all that amazing goodness.
from the bottom of the pan from the meat and the onions and of course, these last ingredients were going to dump that into the stewpot right along with some tomato paste, any crush garlic and one bay leaf, that for some reason i dipped into the tomato paste first sometimes, i do things for no reason little bit of salt and then we 're going to add the rest of our chicken broth a little bit of sugar like a teaspoon just to balance the acidity from the tomato paste in this.
next ingredient, which is a little bit of balsamic vinegar are going to give that a stir.
i 'm not sure why i 'm using the freakishly small wooden spoon.
if that thing snapped i would have to quit youtube, so i should be using a bigger spoon.
but that 's OK, sometimes you gotta live dangerously and then stop me, if you 've heard this before non high, bring it up to a simmer and then back the heat down to low.
maybe just over low to maintain a steady simmer.
you do n't want to rolling boil, but you do want to simmering pretty good.
and they 're going to do with this for about an hour and a half.
i do n't cover mine.
i like to watch it and smell it if it looks like the liquid level is getting a little low.
i 'll add a splash stalker water.
no problem there.
and after about an hour and a half, it 's going to look something similar to this.
i hope all right.
and then we 're going to evaluate we 're going to take a fork.
we 're going to test the doneness of the meat.
i want the fork to go in the meat fairly easily.
yet i do n't want the meat totally falling apart.
so let me check this.
and that was almost there.
i figured i needed about ten fifteen more minutes of cooking, which was perfect because i did want to reduce the liquid a little more.
so i crank the heat up to medium.
i cook that for another ten, or fifteen minutes, which left me with this one of the most gorgeous beef, stews.
you will ever see look at that color and by the way, promise me.
you 're going to taste this for salt and pepper and i apologize for the steam, let me try another angle.
it 's even worse, but you get the idea the meats tender.
the sauce is thickened, and once we 're happy with that, we can serve it up on whatever i like.
some people do rice potatoes.
this is good on pretty much anything and of course, you, gotta, clean up your drips which is what i did there.
i 'm going to finish with a spoon, a sour cream, and because i had it, and i use the dried version in this, too.
i 'm a top with some fresh marjoram, and, that is done.
beef , goulash, and by the way, i 'm sure we have lots of confused americans right now, who thought goulash here in elbow macaroni , casserole.
that 's not what this is, this is the real deal or at least my version of the real deal old world comfort food at its finest that soft succulent sticky beef that rich aromatic, paprika based sauce like i said at the beginning one of the world 's great, great beef stews.
so i really hope you give that a try head over to food wishes, dot com for all the incread amounts and more info is usual, and as always enjoy.
