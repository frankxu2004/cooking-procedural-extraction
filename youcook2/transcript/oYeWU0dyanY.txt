hi guys, i 'm laura vitali.
and on this episode of laurinda kitchen i 'm going to show you how to make spaghetti alla, carbonara, a lot of you have been asking for this recipe, and it 's super , super.
it basically uses a few ingredients, which you probably already have in your fridge.
so i 'm not excited to show it to you.
let 's go over the ingredients so we can get started in any one.
small chopped onion about four to five slices of bacon chopped two eggs about two tablespoons of heavy cream.
some fresh farming died journal, and you 're going to some spaghetti 's very, very simple, you only just a touch of olive oil and salt pepper.
now , you know, you probably already have these ingredients in your fridge.
so why not make this dish tonight.
so good fix very little time to make about fifteen minutes from start to finish.
and the easiest, most delicious.
but yet, they like carbonada, you 'll find it right here to do is take a large pot.
fill it with water.
given nice generous sprinkling of salt and bring up to a boil.
so you can have ready by the time you put in your spaghetti and so.
so anything you wanna, do is taken in organized scalar with high sides, put about a teaspoon of olive oil in there a teaspoon not tablespoon.
you want to preheat it over medium heat.
so we can.
now go over there and.
so terry or bacon first thing we do is put your spaghetti into your boiling water.
and i 'm just going to take my tongue and sure this stuff to make sure that there are submerged in water for this, a nice little toss.
now just going to add our bacon to our preheating, our boylan are nonstick, skillet now.
traditionally , you 're supposed to use friendship to francesca is really very similar to bacon, the only difference is it 's not smoked.
but the reason why i use bakers.
because it 's number one what i had in the fridge number two is just that delicious and number three everybody can find bacon it could be a little bit difficult to find pancetta.
so it 's really no different.
so i 'd like to use this night lean center cut bacon my preference.
but any bacon you never know, and will do.
so just cook this over medium high V and.
so it 's nice, nice and crisp.
but not sure to chris.
because we 're going to continue to cook it without onions are bacons cooking up really nicely starts again nice and crisp at this point, you want to add in your finely chopped onions is one small onion and the reason, why i 'm not adding any salt is.
because the bacon is very salty and i do n't want to overdo it.
but i do want to add a good amount of black pepper.
because cracked black pepper, which i 'm going to put here and in a little salt we 're going to make is a huge, huge part important part of a really good traditional carbonada, carbonada is very easy it just bacon eggs or pancetta and eggs really an everywhere you go in italy have their own way of making it in italy and from naples this is the way we make it, and we are proud of it.
so let 's just go together for a few minutes until the onions are to cook down and while that happens, i am going to go back to the counter and show you how to make a sauce to go with it.
now in a small bowl we 're going to put in two eggs two cracked eggs two tablespoons of heavy cream a ton of freshly ground black pepper oil as much as you like i should say, i remember is very important into a traditional carbonara recipe and have really generous amount of family down a journal and this is it this is the software going to put a tiny bit of salt in there not too much 'cause remember our pasta water is both even our bacon is very salty our cheese is very salty.
so we do n't want to overdo it that 's a pretty good amount i say perfect.
now we 're not really going to cook this, and you 'll see you 'll see how this comes together, pinch of salt, and i 'm just going to use my little with here in just makes us together.
now we are soft together so, decide.
now all i did here was take my bacon and onions off the stove and this is important that you do this off the burner 'cause you do n't want to scramble the eggs i drain my pastor just going to add it to the bacon and onions just like.
so now very quickly you 're going to add in your egg and cream, and finally, john original sauce and just you 're going to have to work this really fast, fast perky 'cause you 're only like going to scramble the eggs.
but you see how they 're starting to cook got exactly what you want i ca n't even describe how perfect this is every single time, as long as you take the pan off the burner you have a perfect couple not every single time just start this together to mix smells like heaven in here it 's amazing and we just played this up hall boy that perfection in my book right there that 's the way a couple nada should be it should not be drenched in sauce is should not be colonel and ugly and scrambled it should be silky smooth, every strain of spaghetti should be coded in that sauce and i ca n't tell you how good the smells, i mean, you really should be here for this, i 'm just going to take this, uh, by this i 'm going to embarrass myself i know it on the money that is.
