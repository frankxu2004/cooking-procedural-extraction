hi , everyone today we 're making an authentic german dish of german style sauerkraut with grilled bratwurst on top OK for today 's dish, we need three fresh bratwursts, one jar of sauerkraut and some olive oil will be using one half cup of chopped onion and also about the same amount of chopped apple, one garlic clove, minced a few juniper berries and one whole bay leaf to start with.
we 're going to prep are apple half of it.
so what we want to do is then peel.
it once are apples peeled half of it.
we want to go ahead and just kind of give it a course shop.
so in a medium pot, we want to put it on medium to high heat and add.
are olive oil.
just a little bit in their coat.
the onions, when we add, them, let that heat up snow at our onion.
what kind of start, kidding, around a bit.
the onions nice and tender.
we 're going to go ahead and add are apple that we chopped up and are minced.
garlic century AD that altogether, and if those soften up a bit.
now what we want to do is add the whole jar of sauerkraut, including the liquid that was a fork.
and we 're going to let this cook for a few minutes, bringing the heat up just a tad just to get everything in here.
nice and warm OK, once are sauerkraut, mixtures warm through, but not yet boiling what we want to do, then is bad.
just a little bit more water probably about a quarter to a half a cup.
our juniper berries, a good pinch of salt and, are bay leaf and we 're going to kind of mix that in there and what we want to do.
now is lower the heat cover and we 're going to cook this for about half an hour to an hour alright in another pot, a little larger one.
i put some cold water, and i 'm going to boil, it.
and what i 'm going to do this is a technique i like to do takes the guesswork out of cooking the brought.
worst , if you boil am just on a light boil that cook through.
and then there 's no guesswork.
when you 're frying him up in a pan on our crowd at simmering at low, he we want to check on it here from time to time and make sure it 's got enough liquid in there.
add a little more water.
if it looks like it 's starting to dry out.
but this one looks really, really tasty.
and it smells who wonderful so will.
let that go for another fifteen minutes, or so.
OK , once are brought worst SAR, they 've been boiling now for just a few minutes, just so you can see that they get cooked through.
we want to go ahead and turn off the heat and what we 're going to do is just put him on a plate and set aside, all right now, we 're going to check on our sauerkraut.
still has plenty of liquid.
it still simmering on low heat.
we 're going to let that cook for another ten or so minutes.
wanna separate skillet, we 're going to heat up some butter and a little bit of olive oil to that just to keep the butter from burning let that warm up.
evenly , here kind of distributed the butter and the oil.
OK , this is on medium to high little more towards the high heat level.
butters nice and melted.
and we 're going to go.
start the brown, and.
now that 's why i boil them before or parboil them.
so that i know that the center is cooked pretty much and that we do n't have to worry about these things.
getting really black.
and the insides are all pink and unequip.
so you 'll notice from the natural casing.
with some liquid, will excuse?
and structure civil.
you want to do.
is expensive lightly brown.
just kind of tournament do n't go on the other side service.
we 're going to go ahead and turn the flame off on the sauerkraut 'cause it was nice and done and cooking for about forty five minutes.
and we 're going to shut the heat off and keep it covered just to keep it warm.
and set aside time to give our browsers another script alright i brought worst look like their beautifully browned and ready to be served up.
so here we go OK so using a slotted spoon for going to play dupa knife.
