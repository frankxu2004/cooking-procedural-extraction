OK , i did wash my chick in our institution vinegar and also in the corsaut that i 'm using the kosher salt.

my future depends on you can leave them in it.
wo n't be no deal because you can.
still , do everything.
you 're doing before that.
i think that a lot of woman thinks it means not needing anybody.
and i think it means the opposite.
i do n't think a woman should define themselves as independent by social status or economic size.
i 'm not gonna sit down and let me work all day as long as he 's on his way to be.
it 's not the dollar house should be comes down to the ambition of your man and if it 's about a partnership could really give a shit with the winning constructs to make less than that so that she.

the cash standard for a man to be fuck hockey with his when a woman she ca n't she has to be extremely humble.
that 's enough money.
i do n't think.

i could be independent academic ninety feet.
i do n't choose i choose not to take care of myself by myself.
yes , now i got there had to have no amanda nichols, you know, me.
i think it should be in position.

but the birds are breaking.
and i see you.
gotta look at the front of the burglar, and i worked, i think if we wanted quality which is what we say we want go ahead and racine.
i need for you to be a man, or through what a medical things to do and then.
but having the man roll, where were looked as if there poppy we try to use?
we have the negative factor always down necessarily controlled by her man, but she can think she can support him the way she needs to manage her life.
but , you know, where she 's not going to go now, you know, go chasing one, defend themselves and their thoughts in their ideas.
tractive thing about a woman or a man is willing to say confidently who they are whether it fits the norm or not to me that independence, such thing as an independent woman.
because we are all dependent upon each other.
