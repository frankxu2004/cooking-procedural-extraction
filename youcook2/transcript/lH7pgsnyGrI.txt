welcome through japanese cooking one.
oh , one today, we 're gonna make me so soup.
let 's take a look at the ingredients.
we have four cups of dashi or fish broth.
one package tofu, four to five tablespoons, missile paste, and two green onions finely chopped meso paste is a paste made from fermented soybeans used to season soup sauce and other dishes.
there are different kinds of missile by color texture and flavor, you can find me.
so at some grocery stores, these days in the refrigerator or asian food i 'll if you have a japanese or asian market nearby you can certainly find more varieties.
or you can just order one online that she used here is japanese fish broth.
and it is a key flavor factor of meso soup.
we explain more details in our dashi recipe video and on our website, japanese cooking one, oh, one dot com, it is easy to make an very flavorful.
OK , first we are going to cut tofu.
there 's no right or wrong way to cut tofu, but you can just slice it in half.
and , then cut it into bite size pieces.
you can use both soft and hard kind tofu in a soup, you can also use vegetables.
seafood and meat in mister soup instead of tofu.
you can make it harder by adding more stuff or make it simple like this one.
it 's all up to you as i said before to make good meso soup.
you need good dashie.
here 's a quick recap from our dashy video.
all you need to do is to put a couple of handfuls, of bonito flakes into boiling water and cook for a few minutes and strain it.
that 's it, it 's really simple.
and we explain all about it in our dashi recipe video now.
we have four cups of dashie, already made in the pot.
we then put the tofu in and he did on the medium heat until the toffees, hott.
you do n't need to bring it to a boiling point.
because tofu is delicate.
but just to the point that it 's heated through if you are using other ingredients such as vegetable seafood and meat in misso soup, you can bring it to boil and cook until everything is cooked through.
now we had missile taste if you have a small strainer like this.
it 's easy to just dump mister in and dissolve me so directly in the pot.
if you do n't have one, you can just use a lateral.
you do n't need to string me so paste, but trainer just makes it easier to stare it in the part without breaking tofu.
finally , you put some green onions and remove from heat looks great, does n't it meso soup is, japanese soul food and often called no aji, which is a flavor of mom 's home cooking we certainly love the flavor and it 's a true comfort food for everyone hope you will enjoy it as much as we do.
