hi guys, and learn, but alley, and on this episode of laura in the kitchen i 'm going to show you how i make my claim chowder.
it 's been requested here and learned it does n't quite a bit.
and i love it.
and i think it 's just incredible in the summer.
so i 'm really excited to share this recipe with you.
this is my take on it.
and , let me take you on ingredients.
so you started your going to chop onions celery.
this is thick cut bacon and a kind little pieces.
some chopped potatoes and fresh corn kernels.
all purpose flour, fresh thyme course, you 're clams and just a few additional ingredients, which i 'll go into as we proceed with the recipe and the first thing.
i will talk about, is the clams.
now my favorite kinds of claims to use for claim chat or any kind of soup really these are cherrystone claims the really big the really me D, and they provide incredible flavor and texture to your soup, you can use other kinds of claim i absolutely suggest you use cherrystone, and there are much less expensive than the other kinds of claims that i have n't defined grocery store or fish store.
so let me tell you how i clean them i put my claims in cold water for thirty minutes, and then drain them and with a little brush like this, you can find the local supermarket i scrub, scrub, scrub each every name in one of them and then i put them back into a clean bowl with clean water let them stuck again for thirty minutes drain them and put 'em in clean water that 's how i always have cleaned my claims and i figured that 's a good way to go.
so what we 're going to do is actually make our own claim juice.
because there 's no need to buy it if you can make your own part i 'm going to heat it up over high heat i 'm going to add in some water i 'm going to wait for the water to come to a boil.
now why bike lanes juice, when you can make your very own from very young, fresh claims.
so once that comes to a boil i 'll show you the.
next step, add my clams to my boiling water this is going to provide.
so much good flavor we 'll see and.
now with clams when you buy them, they should all be tightly closed if there open done by them.
they 're not good.
and this should not have like a fishy awful smell.
this she really does not smell like anything.
besides the see a few days ago, i went to store, and i want to get clams.
and they smelled so bad that the counter i was there 's no way that i could purchase them, i mean, they smell like rotten sewage.
you got bad clam.
if it smells like die should just smell like the sea.
so any use boiling water lid on for about seven to ten minutes or until all the clams open up and after they open up i 'll show you.
next step like clams are open.
and i 'm just taking them out with a slotted spoon here.
look at that score.
just already, now there all open set them aside to cool for a bit.
and now over here what i 've got is a sieve as a fine sieve.
and i wind it with some paper towels, you can line it with cheese cloth.
you can line up with coffee filters, you can line with pretty much anything that you want.
i 'm using paper towels it works i 'm going to do is i want you to take this gorgeous.
briny , liquid here, and i want you to pass it through.
but i do n't want you to take the very, very bottom.
because any sand that comes out of the shells or of the clams collects at the bottom of the pot, and you do n't want to do that i 'm just going to strain this really nice, and patiently once your liquid has been strained.
you want to set that aside as well to get big part you can use the same one or you can use a nice heavy duty part which is what i 'm using.
and i have n't created over medium heat into this going to add in my bacon, no oil necessary.
and gives it a lot of its own fat.
and i 'm just going to cook the bacon until it 's nice and chris, and in the mean time here 's what i 'm going to do last week, and i am going to take each piece of clam and take the meat out, i mean, look at that look at that i 'm going to take them all out.
and i 'm going to chop them into like bite size.
pieces like that, like that 's perfect time to remove the bacon.
all that lovely drippings or perfect.
now if you find that your bacon renders out way too much fat you 're really looking for to two to three tablespoons, then drain some of it.
but that as you can see it 's not a whole, whole lot.
so i 'm going to just use that, and so it came out by gene.
now , i think clam chowder is the plane that some people or passionate about making it a certain way.
and that 's it and that 's fine.
that 's great, but like all things in cooking do what you like you may think according to your taste.
this happens to be the way.
i love clam chowder.
and it was really inspired by my last trip to self in san francisco, where it came in this gorgeous big sourdough bread bowl, which was incredible.
i thought it was a little too heavy.
so i 'm not serving in and bread bowl.
but you absolutely can.
but this was just inspired by that trip, you do n't like corning yours.
we could just think that put in corning clam chowder, then.
no , no, they do n't punch them in or you can use canned clams you can do.
whatever you want really.
this is just my take on the clam chatter.
i 'm going to my veggies and letting them cook for about four to five minutes or until it becomes nice and soft.
you 're not looking for them to really develop a lot of color, you just looking for them to cook down a little bit.
so that i 'm going to add in a little bit of flour and the flower help thicken the soup and again with clam.
chowder is a preference thing, so some people really like their super thick.
some people like on their little thinner side, so, if you like really think then adding a little bit more flower or adding a little less liquid.
if you like thinner adding more liquid it 's completely up to.
you , i 'm just adding it a little bit, at a time, so that i can kind of took it out.
so i do n't have that role flower, taste, you know, which i really despise cook that for about thirty seconds looks awesome.
going to add in our potatoes.
but i just peeled and diced and some fresh thyme.
i love fresh thyme strip.
it right off the stem there the leaves are so tender really, really lovely.
i had my corn fresh corn kernels right off the cobb best, annuar clam juice, oh, yes, perfection.
now i 'm going to do is let this come to a boil, and i 'm going to simmer for about twenty five minutes or until the potatoes are tender and then i 'll show you the last final step start before we dig in.
now that you potatoes are tender.
my super been simmering for about twenty five minutes after this.
i 'm going to add in my clams.
nice large chunks of clam a little heavy cream do n't look if you 're on a diet.
you 're on the treadmill for an extra hours, tomorrow, but it 'll be worth it going to add on your bacon, your crisped up earlier some parsley.
and you need to see the networks in salt and pepper, and.
now you want to season it, according to taste, i have tasted this already as it was cooking.
so , i know how much it means just remember that the of course, the claim brought.
there 's already kind of salty and briny and the bacon salty.
so keep that in mind when you 're seasoning.
so what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to get this nice big stir and let this cook for about five minutes.
i want to claims kind of warm up.
then i 'm going to turn this off.
and it 's going to be time to serve an my chowder is done look at that gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, now.
if you want to, of course, you can serve this with some sourdough bread or some crackers on top.
but this is.
so clear on its own, really does n't need anything to kind of company.
i need a pizza claim though, so this is going to be more italian day, rather.
baja very, very good, i will say this, this is probably the only way i 'll make clam chowder, and i know that the flavor of the corn and can be overpowering.
but i personally love that sweetness against the briny, clams and if you want to try a recipe.
new recipe, for i really hope that you give this one a shot, it 's easy.
it 's delicious, it just highlights some of the best, best flavors of summer.
i think an in moderation, of course, you can definitely enjoy a bowler, too, with this.

incredible , now, see you next time, bye, bye.
