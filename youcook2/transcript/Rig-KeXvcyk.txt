hi , remind me to read and welcome to my kitchen and today, we 're going to be making some brunch.
and we 're going to be making something a little unconventional.
we 're going to be doing croque.
and crooked montia.
and if you do n't know what that is, that 's just a fancy french way of saying grilled ham and cheese and grilled ham and cheese with a fried egg on top, so.
let 's get started.
OK , let 's build our croak miss year in the crook monsieur.
is the one that is just a plain grilled ham and cheese?
i have some really nice french bread.
because french bread was the good bakery bread which i can never seem to resist, was on special this week at my harris teeter, buy one get one free.
so when that happens, and it 's still hot out and it 's summertime guess what marine buys her bread, she does n't always bake her bread.
why am i talking about myself?
in the third person.
i do n't know an.
i 'm using soft butter from my butter bell.
i have a butter bell.
i highly recommend that you get one it, it is.
it 's really genius, you know, you put a little water in the base you put the butter in the bell.
you keep it on your counter and the butter stay soft all the time.
so now i 'm i flipped over my bread.
'cause i want the butter on the outside, and i 'm going to layer a couple of slices of munster cheese here, and you can use swiss you can use cheddar.
you can use whatever kind of cheese you want, because this is your sandwich.
we have monster this week because that 's what was on special at the deli.
and then i 'm going to go ahead.
whoops , i forgot, i like to make sure that i have cheese on both sides of the meat.
but only one piece.
because three pieces plenty in that will help the sandwich.
stay together when you 're grilling it.
and i 'm going to go ahead.
and i 'm going to spread on a little butter on this other side of the bread.
and i 'm going to make another this going to layer of sandwiches, down, i preheated that griddle at about three hundred degrees.
and i have also because we 're going to make the croc madame.
i have oiled up a couple of my english muffin rings, and i 'm going to put them.
bill side down on the griddle.
i 've oiled the insides so that they do n't stick and i have my spatula, and because this riddle has been preheated.
these are not going to take very long to start melting and cooking and getting really nice and delicious so what we 're going to do is.
we 're going to allow these to cook.
and then we come back will flip 'em.
and then i 'll drop my.
eggs , and then i 'll show you what that looks like now.
we 're going to go in.
i flip this one already like i said, if you have a preheated, griddle is not going to take very long at all, and then i always find that i have to readjust after i flipped.
so we 're just going to put these over here and let them milty thing.
and then i 'm going to move my rings give a little spray in there.
the ring may or may not help.
i find that it is a bit helpful this season is eggs with a little herbede, preval 's and i 'm not going to break the yolk.
because rick and i both like our eggs over medium and.
now i 'm going to see if this is going to let me almost.
it 's hot thirsty.
i can use this.
yeah , i 'm gonna need to perry lake.
frozen call connie.
if you have to you can just loosen around the edge of the egg.
of course, you do n't have to put your egg and egg mold.
i must be really want to let 's see, if this works.
and my husband once again was right say it again.
so if you only get one it contains there 's no denying it, huh.
and of course, you cook your egg.
anyway , you like it, you do n't have to make it over medium, you can make it, sunny side up if you like an.
i broke my eggs, see no worries just keep it all together.
not a big deal.
it 's still gonna taste great.
and if you match it up like that for your guests nobody is ever going to know that it was n't supposed to be that way simple.
we can give these another flip these are gorgeous look at that, beautiful OK.
so now we 're going to get ready to fix you a plate of croak madame, an karaca, mocio.
because i know you 're hungry OK here you go i fixed your plate what do you prefer.
crook , monsieur or croque madame with egg without egg.
it 's just the fancy, fancy french way of saying grilled ham and cheese with or without an egg.
so you make that choice i 've also garnished these with the avocado fan and tomato flower that i demonstrated in another video, and you can click to see that down below and is n't this fun.
i just think these are so fun, and, you know, you can kids.
and you can teach him croak madame and crook miss.
