hi , i 'm john stage and this is dude food today.
we 're going to give a barbeque treatment to an old culinary, warhorse, the meatloaf.
i 'm going to sort a little bit of onions, peppers and garlic.
and we 're going to just cook these just cook the raw out of them were not looking.
we 're not looking to brown and we 're not looking too.
we 're not even looking translucent, we just want to get that rovick.
now we 're going to take this bread that 's been soaking in milk and just kinda squeeze this out.
be careful not to squeeze it all over you, which i 've done many times move this out of the way just give us a good quick chop, chop without the binding agents of milk bread and eggs, you never really going to get meatloaf you 're going to get kind of like a big brick of dried out ground beef let me salt and pepper these guys up a little bit OK.
let 's take the ground beef into the bowl little bit of the sausage.
let 's get our a multiplication agent, which is the bread crumbs couple eggs a little bit of salt little bit of black pepper a little bit of human actually good dose accumen, some chili pepper and a little bit of cayenne.
let 's see where we 're at here like i said before we 're really not looking to cook these too much we 're just trying to take the roll off it OK when i say culinary, warhorse i made it man meatloaf has come and gone on meant restaurant menus over the last forty years little bit of barbecue i ca n't call it a barbecue meatloaf without a little bit of barbecue, do n't forget that.
but we do n't want to do before we do anything is taste this meet very important.
because we 're going to load this up.
and you do n't want to come back an hour later and find out your meatloaf was n't season properly, you know, we make our homemade sausage of the restaurant.
what was the guy who piped without tasting?
i 'm going to wash my hands, real quick alright.
let me taste this.
i 'm going with that season properly salted.
correctly , good balance show.
all right, this is.
now the fun part put a ride in this loaf pan.
let 's get rid of this, and then we 're just going to give the final treatment.
well , there 's a little bit of barbecue sauce over the top.
we 're going to bake this at three fifty for about an hour, hour and fifteen minutes.
you want this around one fifty, one fifty five.
i hate over cooking meatloaf.
so think of meatloaf, is a burger is one fifty one sixty year approaching well, medium, well, well.
so why would you over cook a meatloaf.
so one fifty year good, but if you 're a little skittish, go a little longer.
but it 's not going to be as moist.
so i 'm going to put this soon.
good , just a little bit more barbecue sauce, just a light glazing on the top just to give it a nice shine.
OK , this looks really good.
i 'm going to cut it.
so what this looks like hold mail nothing wrong with that moist, well seasoned just got, the full barbecue treatment.
that 's the dish barbecue meatloaf.
