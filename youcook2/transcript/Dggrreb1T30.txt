hi , everyone, said, this is my quick and easy shepherds pie.
this is the ingredients.
you 'll need frozen peas asparagus better frozen smartass.
i usually get chopped tinned tomatoes, but i have n't gotten in.
so i practice chop them up.
one onion beef stock cube or alarm.
stop cube two carrots, some more minutes, this is no idea how much dinner, oh, five hundred grams.
and we 've got five potatoes.
there is white potatoes.
so , first off i 've peeled the potatoes cut them in half and then put them in some water to boil.
yeah , until the basically soft enough to mash.
so a deist.
my onion and carrots very quite small, i quite like them smaller cook quicker as well.
i have put together of oil in my path.
i 'm waiting that to warm up.
and then i 'm going to add my carrots and onion and then sort of so take them to their so nice and soft.
so they 've been so fucking a browning for about five minutes.
i 've just been staring through it and stick to the boston.
i 'm going to add to the alignments down on top.
so then i might see at night, then, and i 'm going to come down here and let die feels brown off.
so i 'm going to heat source, tearing it just so round rock same time that 's alignments so that 's.
alignment so ground off.
now i 'm going to add the stock Q, and basically just going to crumble.
and over it up, this just adds, extra flavor, it 's not necessary for do n't really want to.
but i find it just adds extra flavor now, adding salt and pepper i do n't usually add salt and pepper to my nails mix that in.
so i 've added the plum tomatoes.
i 've actually cut them up while they 're in here.
so , yeah, mix setting.
next up over the way for a few minutes.
so i 've let it all simmer and reduce down for about ten minutes, has been bubbling away just.
so it 's sort thickens up.
now i 'm going to add some peas.
some just spoke to match my potatoes.
i have picked in a spoonful of butter spoonful of mayonnaise and hellmann 's white and low birth pepper and little bit salt.
so i 've sprinkled some cheese over the top.
and this is actually been in the fridge for about four hours because i did n't actually need to cook it straight away.
so now it 's going in the oven at one hundred and eighty degrees for forty minutes.
