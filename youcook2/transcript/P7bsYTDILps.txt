hi , i 'm dying cometa, antidaeon, dishing with die.
i 'm going to show you how to make meatloaf, this is a really classic dish, and it 's very simple to make so.
let 's get started on dish and would die, you need some ground beef that 's been sitting at room temperature for about an hour.
and this is an eighty twenty percent.
i also have a finely minced sweet onion.
some wish to share sauce.
some prepared mustard, some garlic powder ground pepper and salt.
this is some bread slices that i 've cut into small cubes.
some ketchup, some barbeque sauce milk at room temperature and egg and some additional catch up.
so the first thing that we 're going to do is take the room temperature milk and pour that right over these bread cubes.
and we 're just going to let this sit for a few minutes.
so that the bread can kind of absorb that i 'm just going to toss that around a little bit.
i 'm going to mix together some of the seasonings.
so i have this little bit of catch, up here.
and i 'm going to take the onion and put that in along with their wishes share sauce.
i can never pronounce this.
the same two times wish ashira wishes shire worcester sauce.
and then this is the prepared mustard and then the salt pepper and garlic powder.
and then you 're just going to wish this together with a fork just to get it all combined.
because i do n't want to just kind of dump it in there and have one area where there 's a whole bunch of garlic powder and another area where there 's not and then take that egg.
and then you just want to whisk that together and then over here to our bowl with our meat, and i 'm just going to take the catch up with the onion mixture.
i 'm going to pour that right on in and then in with our breadcrumb mixture and then throw in your egg.
and then you 're going to get your hands in there and kind of, toss this around.
so just lightly until everything gets really thoroughly combined, you have a baking sheet here that i 've lined with some parchment paper and i just took a parchment paper on there.
so that this does n't stick to just get the meatloaf out one to the parchment and then shape that into a nice loaf.
you see, i did n't pack it too tight, and now i have that little bit of ketchup and barbecue sauce.
so we 're just going to mix these together, and when i was a kid.
my mom always use ketchup.
but i like to kind of jazz it up a little bit, with a little bit of the barbecue sauce and then just pour this right over the top and just kind of spread it out.
nice and evenly anne, it 's as simple as that, that 's it, it 's ready to go into my oven, three hundred and fifty degrees for about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes or until it reaches an internal temperature of about a hundred and sixty degrees and then you want to take it out and let it rest for about ten minutes before you slice into it if you try to slice into it when it 's very hot it might crumble a little bit.
so you just want to let it sit on the baking sheet for about ten minutes, and then there it is it cooked for about an hour.
it 's nice and crisp on the outside with that nice moist tapin.
it 's moist and tender on the inside, and it 's great with mashed potatoes.

i hope i made your life a little easier more enjoyable and delicious up to you next time.
bye , bye now.
