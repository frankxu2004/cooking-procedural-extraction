hi , brandon walker, two nigos, kitchens.
what you want today 's recipe request comes in from the facebook user, johan soaring garden.
he has asked me to make some vina, schnitzel, so let 's get started.
this god budget bounds montag.
you want wednesday faster friday, what else could be shit bad line mills, up.
so , of course, we 're going to be using some veal traditionally.
that 's what 's used in a venus.
nitzel and the cut that i 'm using here today is from the rib area.
it 's a veal cutlet, not great flavor to it you use.
whatever cut of veal steak that you like and whatever you can get your hands on you can also get your butcher to prepare it for you as well.
but i 'm going to quickly show you how to get it nice and thin.
so what i 've done is, i 've cut if you using the cut like.
i am i 've cut it off the bone.
so i 've got rid of that part, trimmed off the fat.
and then i 'm going to put it into a snaplock bag, and then i 'm going to use a meat.
and i 'm going to hammer out the meat until it 's nice and thin.
you can also use a pot to do this as well, if you do n't have a meat hammer to do it.
and this is the thickness you can see here.
this is the thickness that we are after nice.
then you can see how we 've gone from a state that size and almost tripled in size.
now you 've seen me do this, many times before i 've set up a breading station.
because obviously we 're going to be coding our veal play awesome egg and also some bread crumb.
but first i 've got some flower now very important.
do n't season the flower just normal plain flour?
and i 'm going to grab our veal i 'm just going to coat it in that flower is very important.
also , when you 're doing venus nitzel, do n't press anything in just get some flower put it on the top like that dust?
the excess off do n't get your hands in and really press it all in the next step.
of course is some eggs and i 've just got two egg yolks, but there 's no water just eggs.
and i 'm going to lay the veal straight in there and get it nicely coated.
and lastly i 've got some bread crumbs again.
and they 're just ordinary bread crumbs.
make sure you use dried bread crumbs to this, do n't use fresh, and i 'm going to get our veal from our and again do n't president, you just want to put it on there like that.
OK , that 's exactly what we after.
so just keep repeating that process with as many wienerschnitzel 's as you want to make.
now we 're going to be cooking our schnitzel and in a large pan here.
i 've got some butter.
now some of you will be saying some butter.
my god, how much butter is that now traditionally, this is done with butter, and it 's shallow fried.
and that 's the way it 's done today.
lot of restaurants and a lot of people will do get fried in canola oil or something like that, which is a healthier alternative.
so going to be placing our schnitzel in and.
because it is quite thin, i only want to cook it for about three minutes, a minute and a half each side, the outside will be nice and golden, brown do this over a medium to high heat.
so just check it out.
i 've pulled out our venus sensel from the pen beautiful golden brand.
the smell is wonderful and into that nice crust, it 's puffed up a little bit.
and that 's exactly what we want.
now what are we going to serve with this.
normally i would serve a potato grotten with this 'cause.
i think it goes great potatoes in this dish.
match , made in heaven.
i will pop a link to some potato grow ten that i 've made before in the description.
if you want to go and check out that video going to save this up with today are some boiled baby potatoes, and i 've just dressed them in a little bit of olive oil seasoned them with some salt and pepper.
and then i 've put some fresh herbs.
i 've got some parsley, some chives and i 've just popped it.
i 've also got some deal, and i 've just mixed it through there.
and i 'm going to be serving that up with this.
and , of course, it would n't be complete without a slice of lemon on the side, and you 're going to use that lemon.
you can pop it over the potatoes, of course over the schnitzel there, and i tell you what, guys this is, dudes food.
it 's my sort of food.
i love it.
let 's get stuck into this bad boy.
so this is one of my favorite, favorite dishes.
