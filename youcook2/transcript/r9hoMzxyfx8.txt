hey guys richard blame, here, mister easy cooking, thanks for stopping by my easy cooking channel tonight.
many of you my subs and viewers know that i have a major league penchant for asian food and tonight.
i 'm going to make some more asian food.
i 've been taking requests for a long, long time.
and this last week i got a request from the viewer in vietnam that said make vietnamese style kimchi, and i was like, OK, vietnamese style, kimchi.
that 's a new one on me but come to do some research.
and yes, the vietnamese in southeast asia have their own version of kimchi, not quite what the koreans do with kimchi.
but just as lovely, just as vibrant just as tasty as spicy as any kimchi that you could get out of korea the ingredients are about the same you guys always hear.
me say that the reason i love asian food is.
because asian foods are interchangeable, and they are right what i 'm going to make for you is vietnamese style , kimchi.
this is quite possibly going to be the shortest video i 've ever made.
it 's a lovely dish.
it goes great on top of rice on top of noodle in soup, but either way it 's kim chi.
it 's delicious, it 's southeast asian inspired so let 's get going, and i 'll see you on the other side.
all right now to make this vietnamese style, kimchi.
what i have here is napa cabbage that 's wilted.
i wanted this overnight.
i have julian of scallion.
i have julian of carrot, and i have some finely slivered red onion and i have some cucumber now.
the cucumber, i added in about three hours ago, i do n't let the cucumber, wilt overnight, because it just gets too mushy.
i do wilt the cabbage.
the onion the scallion and the carrot overnight and then about three four hours prior to making this dish i 'll add the cucumber for that extra crunch.
but all of it is very well wilted, neisen, softap.
i rinsed off the excess salt and what we need to make is the kimchi paste, so let 's get going so to make this paste.
if you have some fresh birds, eye chilies, good, use them.
if you do n't you could use this store, but chili paste.
it 's just as good three or four tablespoons right here, that 's about what i 'm going to add.
just depends on how spicy you want your kimchi to be, and i do want this a bit spicy and to that, i 'm going to add some ginger.
OK gotta have ginger gotta, have garlic?
it 's kim chi.
OK to have garlic gotta.
have some sugar up to you one tablespoon, too?
i 'm using about two tablespoons brown sugar, OK.
you could use white.
whatever you have OK here 's a little bit of fish sauce to get it rolling some rice vinegar have to have some moisture in there to get it going here 's one.
some lemongrass for fragrance an for certain amount of flavor and.
because this is, vietnamese style southeast asian i have some dried kefir lime leaves now, sometimes it 's very hard to get fresh kaffar lime leaves and believe you me the dry ones work just as well and have a lot of concentrated flavor.
this is a very simple paste.
this very simple page very easy kimchi recipe.
and i 'm going to grind this down, call, skype calls OK guys now.
what you 'll notice is that i did n't make a rice flour glue like i do for the korean kimchi.
what i am going to use for thickener is a nice healthy tablespoon of sesame E.
no , we get not quite indicative of this recipe.
but as i always tell people, food is open to interpretation.
so i 'm going to add that systematic inner as a thickener and i 'm going to pulse it in all right.
so here the wilted vegetables, and here, is my vietnamese kimchi, paste pepper sesame E kefir lime, leaves lemongrass garlic ginger, and i 'm just going to toss this in by hand, not even going to wear gloves 'cause i 'm not going to worry about it, it is going to toss this in by hand there.
we go in to get all these vegetables.
there , we go fish sauce sugar.
OK , it 's not a standard style.
kimchi elect korean stuff, OK, this is vietnamese style there.
we go and that 's it.
that 's it nice and tossed nice and blended in.
and i 'm going to let this sit for about an hour or two.
then , i 'm going to put it on top of some noodles, so hang outside, all right guys there.
it is vietnamese kimchi on top of some fettuccine noodles, i could have used oriental noodles.
i could use bond rice stick noodles.
i could use so, but korean i could have used boudin.
i could use tongue.
i could have used any noodle i wanted to.
but i picked fettuccine, and i put some of this vietnamese kimchi on top like i said napa cabbage carrot, red onion scallion, cucumber rice vinegar.
this is just delicious.
now , what you doing it once it 's put on top of the noodle, or once it 's put on top of the rice is, you add just little bit of sesame E oil, you could also ferment these vegetables in nuke.
jump you guys have seen me make nuke jump before alright little bit of sesame E well, and then on top just little bit of sesame E seed toasted.
white , black, whatever you want really does n't matter.
because like i say, all the time, the reason i like asian food, is.
because it 's all interchangeable, they all suit each other.
no matter what anybody says all asian recipes suit each other.
no matter what country there it is, with the sesame E seeds and the sesame E oil looks just delicious.
now i gotta, whip out my chopsticks and eat this from my dinner.
i want to thank you for stopping by and i 'll see you in the next video, take care guys.
