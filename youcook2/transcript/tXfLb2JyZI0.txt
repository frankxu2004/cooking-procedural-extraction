hello , everyone today i 'm going to show you how to make roti is indian flatbread, and for that, we need a flat surface.
here , i have a wooden board and a flat rolling pin, this is from india, so, let 's get started here.
i have a doe just make a round ball of dough.
and we need a loose floor.
we gonna dip this in a loose floor, and then start rolling it.
and we 're going to roll it in circular motion with the gentle pressure, and we cannot keep rolling around and round, and round, with the very light pressure you do n't want it to just press it.
so it sticks to the bottom.
so just keep rolling from the side and rotating with the other hand.
it needs some practice and patience.
but you will get it right so roll it until you have a desired size of roti, and now we go to roasted here.
i have a pen ready.
put the roti on it.
and we 're going to roast it a few seconds on each side.
so the first site, very few seconds, and the second side we going to roasted little longer until we see all the bubbles forming.
