they were going to sing and cook by an english shepherd pulsing, saki, and i 'm going to show you how to make mutton calimari that is black pepper button.
now this is something which i learned in hotels when he, i mean and very good to make an i 'm going to show you how you make quickly at home.
so when you have to quickly at home, this piece of equipment the pressure cooker is very important to have.
because you can cook faster and the martin is melt in mouth.
so that 's what pressure cooker can do if you have to cook matter nice, and soft.
this is what this will do for you.
but if you do n't have one, you need to cook it slowly.
it 's a tiresome process.
will take about forty five minutes to have the mutton license off?
so what i 'm going to do is have the gas flame on.
i 'm using key for this recipe, you can use euler.
there 's no hard and fast rule to this two tablespoons of this, this one inch piece of cinnamon bay leaf who three of them some cream cardamom five two six of them some black cardamom now, this is something very, very essential.
this adds more esensten flavor to this whole thing.
so four of them.
now when you add black adam, make sure that you kind of crack them a bit.
because they burst so.
that 's very important so i have cracked them, but when you use at home take the black album just breed them up.
crack them up a bit and do n't cracker till the time you get the seeds out, where the moment the seeds are out of the commentary about then it 's little bit irritating.
the whole flavor is full of black adam.
so you just need to crack and add it to this.
so as it heats up, you start getting the flavor beautiful flavor in here, while an the.
next step makes step.
add some green chili stew.
this , like it spicy, and more, i 'm adding here at all.
four of them just slit in between flavor.
it 's nice and intents.
now when you make a dish like this, specially, if it is martin general rule is say if it is a kilogram of modern one cagey of that 's, little.
about two pounds.
then you need to use similar quantity of onions which are like whole onions, you feel them whatever you get the ild you use that kind of thumb rule for mutton dishes.
so i 'm adding here for sliced onion.
i 'm using about six hundred grams off the modern on board, and that 's also very important.
i like it on bone becaus you get nice stock made when you cook this piece of dish beautiful.
so you need to sweat this and sort it for about three to four minutes.
the onions so that they become limp translucent and nice, and things just need to bring in the sweetness.
this is nice now.
the onions are nice, and pink, what i 'm going to do is, could be mutton in india?
we use go tweet and that is what we all like internationally.
i 'm not to sure whether everywhere you get quote meet easily, but whenever you get quote wait try to use both meet in this.
that 's better to taste at the sheep made that you get in or lamp that you get it 's nice, but i prefer the goat need now.
those who do n't get no choice, then get the lamp open.
quote , the recipe so add D mart and saute for about two minutes.
add two tablespoons of messenger and garlic paste.
and so there again for about three to four minutes and salt the way i do it.
now maximum, yeah, you can sing along and build the energycap all over.
so salt to taste in here, add some water to this about two cups of water.
not much that 's it and what you need to do is since i 'm using a pressure cooker.
so what you need to do.
is , this is one big challenge?
have you tried this linear house?
i always feel that we have our fight at home instead of arguing this go and close a pressure cooker if we can do it fast.
the does n't fast wednesday file, yeah, no harm to anybody.
so now this one is covered, you need to cook it first on high flame for about five minutes, till you get the first person and then you need to cook on slow flame for about twenty.
that 's what the time will be taken to convert merchant.
so , N slow flame, if you keep cooking roughly about eight to twelve vessels, i think about twelve results, you know, on slow flame man, the modernist, nice and done, takes about twenty five minutes.
so what i 'm going to do is live this out here.
do the rest of preparations?
the model is almost scope for twenty five minutes here and another pan with some key, yeah, clarified butter.
that 's what i 'm using as we call in india, ki.
one tablespoon of this, and if you eat dishes like this ensure that you wake up early morning.
next day for a job, without met cannot, read these things good things, we need to add good things to it.
but this is, yeah, so.
here one tablespoon of crushed pepper ann to this.
i 'm going to add cashew nut tastes rich, cash will not paste that 's so cold here.
yeah , so what do you need to do for cashew nut paste.
is i 'm adding about three tablespoons of that, which means you need to take about half a cup of cashew nuts?
boil them an and grind them to a fine place.
now how to do that you will find it in my youtube, videos another recipe of cashew nut paste, and you can similarly follow that recipe.
N do cashew nut place.
now cook this for about three to four minutes becomes a lump like this, leaves the sides of the pan, see here slaving the sides of the path.
beautiful flavor of black pepper keeps turning this is almost ready reducing the flame and hear what you need to do is wow look at this beautiful, add all the button to this, along with the stock and the spices and the onions, every bit of this goes into this, since the button is nice and soft.
it 's already cooked wo n't take much of a time here.
cashew nut brings in the richness all this great dish and adds a nice texture to the gravy.
so what i 'm going to do is hope this for another five minutes, add some garam, masala.
one teaspoon of this you can follow this recipe that there on youtube the way i 've done.
garam , masala nice and rich finally as it gets cooked completely the garden, barsali inside this.
what you need to do is finish it up with one fourth cup of fresh cream.
look at this beautiful mouth is already watering.
yeah , that 's what the dishes all about.
but i saw this, this being made when i went to lucknow on one of the most visited top bars on the roadside.
they made a similar black pepper chicken for me.
so i 've converted this into nice black pepper.
mutton and the dishes beautiful nice rich.
this very, very tasty, i 'm telling you, the only thing that you need to do is eat a bowl full of this, wake up next, day and go for a job.
now to serve all you need is.
