hello , everyone welcome to DDS.
today , we 're going to be making falafel.
those wonderful fried patties made of chickpeas and father beans they make a great vegetarian sandwich and today.
i 'm going to show you how to make it the first ingredients.
we 're going to use our dried chickpeas in dry, fava beans were going to soak them overnight in water to the brim, and then the.
next morning, we 're in a poor off the water when we assemble the falafel.
next we have cilantro and parsley.
you 're going to need about a cup to a cup and a half of cilantro fresh cilantro as always, an about a half cup of fresh parsley you 're also going to need one large onion, you can use yellow onion or white onion, either one we 're also going to need about eight cloves of garlic about two tablespoons of ground coriander, a tablespoon of ground human half teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper half cup of bread crumbs two to three tablespoons of flower some salt teaspoon of baking soda and a half teaspoon of baking powder you want to start by first blending the chick peas in a good food processor you do n't want to use canned chickpeas or can follow beans too much moisture in too many preservatives it 's best to just use the soaking process overnight, we 're going to blend these until they refine crumbly mixture.
now after you 're done grinding them up you want to put empty them into a bowl we 're going to do the same things with the father beans and then blend them until they 're nice and crumbly we 're also entities into the same bowl after we do this step we 're going to add the cilantro, the parsley in the onion to the blender and process that until it 's and i spaced about halfway through we 're going to add one of the most important ingredients garlic i know you all love garlic, and then just continue to blend afterward done, blending, we 're going to add it to the other ingredients, you should smell this.
it smells amazing this cilantro and parsley garlic onion.
what better is there in that at this point.
we want to mix it until it 's very well, combined.
falafel was actually traditionally made with just father, greens as it moved north along the mediterranean, people started to incorporate chickpeas into it.
some people make it with just chickpeas, some people make it with just father, beans that a lot of little variations to the dish.
but the main ingredients are the chick peas and the father.
beans falafel is also a very healthy dish.
if you do n't fry it, you can also bake it.
but many people just fry it up.
it has a lot of protein in a lot of fiber after we 've combined.
the ingredients were going to add all the seasoning start with the coriander.
the human the cayenne pepper.
you do n't like it spicy.
you do n't have to add the cayenne pepper when i add the bread crumbs and thought were going to add two teaspoons salt, actually, let 's do three.
some people like it really salty.
some people do n't like it there.
all depends on how you like it.
and then we 're going to make this up really well after we add all the seasoning you want to check the dose consistency.
this is a lot like a doe.
and if you see that it 's too crumbly.
what you can do as a fix.
it is to add some flower.
i like to add two to three tablespoons of flower.
you do n't want to add too much because you do n't want it to be too doughy.
and then i 'll say raw in the middle when you fry it to just mix it up again.
after you add the flour, and you 're done mixing it, you can actually freeze it.
falafel can actually freeze for up to a month, but you want to freeze it before you add the baking soda, or the baking powder.
just like that, we 're going to add are baking soda and are baking powder.
and then we 're going to let it sit for about ten to fifteen minutes so that those ingredients activate all together.
and you get a nice fluffy for lawful baking powder in the baking soda.
this makes it all up, while the falafel is sitting in your waiting for it.
you want to preheat a two to three inch deep frying pan just regular frying pan, and you want to add to it about an inch and a half of just regular vegetable oil.
i know it 's not that healthy.
but blah felsa, great indulgence and makes a great sandwich falafel men she 's been sitting for fifteen minutes now.
it 's time to fry the falafel.
there 's two different ways you can move the falafel when you fry him you can use a falafel, molder, or you can use two spoons now.
i know this is not readily available everywhere, so you can just use two spoons.
i 'll show you both ways.
so we 're just going to get a spoonful of this, and you just want to mold it up.
so it 's a nice little ball, just like that and be careful when you 're frying it.
you do n't want to burn.
yourself have the oil on medium heat, and just slowly drop it in and continue until you have about ten of them in the frying pan.
now you want to let them cook until their about medium golden brown.
you do n't want them to dark, and you want to make sure that the oil is on medium low heat.
because otherwise they 'll be nice and dark on the outside.
but they 'll be ronnie inside so you definitely do n't want that you want to turn them over just to make sure that they 're not sticking.
look at that color.
see how nice that color is letting their for disa few more seconds see the falafel they smell amazing.
but amount of lame on a paper towel.
so that it absorbs all the excess oil.
now you want to fry the falafel right before you serve them, if you fry, them too far in advance they end up getting really doughy and they end up getting really soft falafel is known to be fluffy.
that 's what the word means you want to make sure they 're crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside now.
if you 're going to use the falafel mold, which are going to do you want to pull it down and then just fill it with a falafel mixture.
the spatula, just like that, and then you want to drop it into the oil it needs a little help, keep your hand low.
we do n't splash now.
we 're done frying up our falafel.
we 're going to put out great sandwich together now.
if you 're trying to stay away from the carbs that 's OK, you do n't have to put into sandwich, you can just eat it with this great tahini sauce.
it 's really easy to make it just some teeny olive oil water garlic mix.
it all up and makes a great sauce.
or you can serve it with garlic sauce.
i know you all love that garlic.
so what i do is i have a nice loaf of pita, and i 'm going to some of the tahini sauce just like that, you can add any vegetables you want to the sandwich.
i like to add a lot of tomatoes to my sandwich.
i also like to add, could be switch?
are these wonderful pickled, turnips?
and then some lettuce, i 'm going to add a little bit of the garlic sauce just because you can never get enough garlic.
i looked at a lot of garlic sauce.
you do n't like garlic, you do n't have to, but who does n't like garlic.
next , you want to get your falafel patty.
place it in the sandwich.
traditionally , they actually much the falafel patty.
when they added, so that 's what we 're going to break it up just like that.
but i want to show you what it looks like look at that look at how nice in green the falafel is.
it 's nice and fluffy, and you could see that the inside is not raw ordo anymore.
it 's perfect going to put that down.
we 're going to roll up our sandwich just like they do at the falafel stands.
well , it nice and tight, and i 've used aluminum foil throughout the sandwich to make it look like just the way you buy it, when you 're at the restaurant.
it 's a sandwich made for a king.
