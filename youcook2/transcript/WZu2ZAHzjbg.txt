i ready chef book here in today.
we 're going to cook us up at china masallah, which is an indian style.
chickpea dish super delicious super easy give it a try.
you gonna love it each skillet up on medium high, and we 're going to add about a tablespoon and a half available and one side heated up with throw, a cumin seeds in there, and then a little bit of asafa, tita just a wee little bit.
if you do n't have ass fertitta that 's alright, you know, you do n't have to use it.
but if you love indian cooking, you want to get ahold of some of this asset potato super.
pungent spice an angle.
i 'm anna stuff flat out stinks, you know, the reason it 's called acid fertitta, is 'cause it smells like ass?
but you know, when it cooks it just totally transforms we gotta throw in some chickpea flour, you know, what this is going to do is going to soak up that oil, you know, when we 're going to push it around getting a little thick and brown and then we 're going to add one can of diced tomatoes now, i like to use canned tomatoes when i 'm doing most of the indian dishes i cook i use.
but i do n't think it 's necessary now, i 'm going to go ahead and add my minced garlic and ginger and stir that around for about a minute man it smells fantastic great dish when they admire chili powder and tumor, you know, the chili powder gives it a nice little kick, you know, you can make it as hot or mild as you want, but, i like, i like a little bit of heat.
so i 'm going to add a hot pepper in here too.
but there 's a million variations of this dish.
so definitely play around with him?
throw your chick peas in there and give those a few minutes, stir nose around and let that cook up a little bit idea.
some salted taste.
then a little bit of garima sala.
now the word masallah just means a collection of spices, you know, masallah, you know, you can get those in most US groceries now.
it 's got some cardamines, some, cinnamon.
some clothes faneuil, black pepper, you know, all sorts of things.
there 's all kinds of varieties now, i have one cup of water into the mix.
get that stirred up and will raise the temperature, you know, will bring the dish to a bubble, then will reduce it down to a simmer throw, a lid on there.
and let it simmer away for about ten minutes now you check these are good opened up and you can take a.
fork , and go ahead and start the mash, some of 'em down.
a little bit, but i like to go ahead and grab my little potato masher and just randomly crush.
some of those chickpeas up, you know, that adds kind of an ice thickness to the dish.
as , as with symbols away.
and you 'll once we get it off the heat because we put that flower in there.
earlier that 's going to help to thicken it up.
so just go ahead and stir it around for a few minutes and there, you go.
china masallah man this dish.
is so easy?
it 's so quick to make, you know, it 's a great introduction to indian cooking.
so give it a try and let me know what you think ma'am and bone apple tea.
