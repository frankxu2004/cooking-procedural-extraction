hello , this is keith cooks and keith and today i 'm going to show you how to make bangers and mash thank you.
when i told my wife, i was going to make video of how to make bangers and mash and apparently gets the name from the tendency of cheap sausages to explode with a bang when you cook them and mashes mashed potato.
so sausages, and mash potato.
very easy, very delicious.
i 've got six pork sausages to medium sized potatoes.
milk another butter, a pinch of salt in a teaspoon of whole grain mustard, so that 's the sausages.
this is all for the potato.
i 've got the oven preheating to two hundred and ten, celsius.
and i 'm going to slam the sausages.
in , for twenty minutes, and then have a look and see how we 're getting on.
i 've also got a pan of boiling salted water, bubbling away for the potatoes.
so just a word about the sausages you want good quality ones from your butcher, i would n't recommend mass produced ones.
but do n't go overboard and do n't get anything too fancy, you know, leak and stilton or, venison or whatever just good quality pork sausages by the way, i 'm doing this for two people.
so it 's three sausages per person.
now we want to peel the potatoes and chop them into chunks, try and get your chunks as evenly sized as you can 'cause.
then i 'll cook more evenly.
and that goes in the pan of boiling salted water until they 're tender which will probably take about twenty minutes also.
so this focus needed an extra ten minutes.
i tell them over, and the reason i baked them rather than bought right and the reason i bake them rather than fry them is, you get a harder, crunchier skin which i find quite pleasant anyway, so, um sponsor, also done.
i 've drained the water off i 'm going to add teaspoon of mustard pinch of.
salt the number of butter and some of the milk, not all of it just yet.
because we might not need it and smash it.
now we 're not aiming for michelin star palm puree those things are disgusting.
so do n't use, please do n't use a food processor to do this course will end up with glue we do n't want lumps.
but we do want texture.
so do n't over mash.
it , but make sure you taste it because that 's perfect um mash without enough.
sultan is just horrible absolute match with too much salt.
this is just right, so.
let 's put it all together.
but they making some onion gravy and the recipe for that should be on the screen now.
so here is a little pile of mash in a bowl and three sausages piled up on top.
then , we 'll just pouring some gravy to form a moat around, does n't look good.
let 's dig in, oh, yeah, you can see while this is a classic.
it 's just fabulous, have ago do?
