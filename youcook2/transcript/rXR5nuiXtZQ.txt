hey , we wanted soft today.
i 'm going to show you how to make a very easy an popular dish called pat, i first, i want to soak your rice noodle in some warm water for about thirty to forty minutes or so, just until it 's al dente.
make sure you watching kind of feel it when it 's pliable, but not too soft.
you want to drain it and set it aside while your noodles are soaking you wanna work on your pad thai sauce.
i have here some concentrated cooking, chambrin, and i 'm going to add take quarter cup of that and mix it with one cup of water.
i 'm going to add this into a pot here, and i did n't show it, but i actually added in three quarters of a cup of palm sugar.
one cup of water and i just added, half a cup of fish sauce.
then you just makes this all up to combine.
it 's very, very important that you cook this outside if you have like outdoor burner or whatnot, if you try to cook this inside, oh, my goodness this stuffs tanks.
it will make your house smell like hot booty on A midsummer 's day.
so this is me cooking it outside in about thirty minutes, so for the thirty minutes.
i had to live on, but not completely all the way.
i left a little crack to list some of that scheme escape and you want to make sure i keep it out of good rolling boil and stir it often to prevent burning, and here 's the sauce.
once it 's cold down completely it 's nice and syrupy.
and this is what you need to get that good color.
and for to stick to the noodles while your stir frying next, you would add in some chopped garlic into some peanut oil.
and you want to stir fry.
this for a couple of seconds and.
next i 'm adding in my shrimp that i had marinating in some of my sauce.
but a couple of tablespoons maybe two or three tablespoons for one pound of shrimp when it once it 's almost completely cooked through set aside, using that same walk i 'm adding in my noodles i did n't mention that you want to make sure you cook this in batches.
so the sauce that i provided earlier, the amount is good for three or four batches.
so you want to take some noodles.
two handfuls at into your walk at a little bit of water and continue to stir for.
i do n't know a minute or so, and then i 'm going to add in some of my pad thai sauce.
i do n't measure how much just takes check it.
i add about a little at a time probably a little and a half for this batch that i added here, also going to add in for some red coloring.
i 'm going to take one tablespoon of ground chili paste, and i 'm adding in a quarter cup of paprika, and i 'm going to toss it in here pretty quickly.
and it 's right there now, if your noodles are labor harder than you wanted them to be then go ahead and just keep stir frying and adding in a little bit of warm water at a time until it 's nice and soft.
but again, not too mushy.
'cause you want to do this all at about a medium high heat it looks like my noodles are right.
where i want them to be.
i 'm going to taste check to see if it needs more sauce, and it tastes good to me.
so now i 'm going to go ahead and add in my shrimp.
i 'm not adding it almost shrimp that i made earlier again.
i 'm making this in batches.
OK , so i 'm going to make a well in the middle, and i 'm going to crack in two eggs.
and i do n't want to stir.
it dressed yet.
i want to have both white and yellow parts, you know, mixed in among the padthai.
so give it about a minute or so, and then start stir fry herb.
scramble it a little bit just to give it some of the nice color within your pad thai, and then again just dirt to combine everything 's coming together quite nicely.
so i turned up the heat, and i 'm adding in some fresh bean sprouts, you can add some just for the garnish as well.
and that 's all.
folks just garnish the way you like some fresh chives, bean sprouts ground roasted peanuts and chili paste or chili powder do n't forget a generous amount or squeezing of lime.
and you 're good to go thanks for watching bye.
