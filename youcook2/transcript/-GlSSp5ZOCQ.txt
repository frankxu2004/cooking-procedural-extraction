hey guys, it 's joanne fifteen spatulas and today, we 're going to make new england style clam chowder.
this is a cream based chowder, instead of the tomato based manhattan style chowder, i just think the cream based taste so much better.
but i do n't claim this to be an authentic new england clam chowder.
there 's all sorts of arguments about what that even means.
because there are.
so many ways that people make new england clam chowder.
but for my version, there 's two things that i like to do first of all, i love using fresh clams.
so much better and something about canned clams just kind of weird me out.
and i have n't found a brand that i think really taste good.
and then the second thing is this is n't a flour.
thicken soup, i think sometimes new.
so they can spit out any sand from the inside.
in the meantime chop, up, one large yellow onion you want to end up with about two cups total for this and when the clams are done.
rinse off the clams again and then add them to the bottom of a soup pot and cover with a half cup of dry white wine, turn the heat to high and cover the pot with a lid.
let the liquid come to a full boil.
then , give the clams about four to five minutes to open up.
then we can remove the clamps from the liquid and sometimes the clams are stubborn to open and might need a little bit more time.
but if any of them do n't open after seven to eight minutes, throw them out the clam liquid.
this time around was a bit muddy.
so i discarded it.
but if it looks relatively cleary constrain out any sand in a paper towel line strainer and incorporate that into your chowder.
but you 'll be fine without it as well.
clean the pot out and add three strips of thick cut bacon.
this is about four ounces.
and while that cooks, and chris up you can remove all of the clams from the shell with your fingers, remove the bacon from the pot and blocked some of the excess bacon fat with a paper towel.
and then add all of your yellow onion and stir, and cook that for about ten minutes to soften scraping up any of the brown bits from the bottom of the pan.
next add two eight ounce bottles of clam juice that 's two cups and add an extra cup of water as well, and bring that to a boil in the meantime, dice up a large half pound, russet potato add that to the chowder and similar the potatoes for about ten minutes until tender.
crumble up the bacon, add that in the clamps to the chowder, then add a half cup of heavy cream stir that in and then i like to add a little pinch of cayenne pepper, give that esther unnecessary salt and pepper seasoning adjustments and it 's ready to serve gotta bowl of my chowder here 's get in a spoonful with clam bacon potato, an onion on here to give us a taste in my car.
hi , this is just spectacular.
mean the flavor is just the perfect blend of that sweet cream.
darien , that see briny clam.
it 's so good.
the sweetness of the onion the meatiness and smoking this from that little bit of bacon, advice and hardy from those potatoes.
and they thicken the broth ever so slightly.
but it 's still got really nice consistency to it.
i absolutely love this chatter so much.
well , i hope you guys enjoy learning how to make this recipe.
and i hope you give it a try and think it 's a nice simple recipe, but still has so much flavor.
i 'm good thanks for watching.
i 'll see you guys next time.
