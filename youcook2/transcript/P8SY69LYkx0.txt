hi , this is brian cheeser from trellis at the heathman hotel in kirkland, washington.
and we 're here to show you how to make a juicy hamburger out of lean ground , beef.
we 're going to start off today with ground sirloin, and this is a special grind.
and in order to have a juicy hamburger, we want to certain fat content, so we 're looking for about eight to ten percent fat.
that means we 're going about ninety to ninety two percent lean.
we 've asked our butcher to grind this force.
so it 's already pre ground and what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to add into this little bit of sauteed.
red onion little bit of sauteed, celery and some fresh herbs and that is going to help us create a nice juicy burger.
i want to put a touch of pepper not too much salt just a little bit of salt.
now the salary in the onion been pre, sauteed, a little bit.
what they 're going to do is when we cook, our burgers slowly, they 're going to bring some juice, and they 're also going to help keep it nice and lean.
so i 'm going to put a pair of gloves on one of the most important things when making burgers or handling ground meat is that you want to have your work surface.
clean and sanitized.
make sure that your cutting board run it through the dishwasher.
all utensils are nice and clean.
and i 'll show you a little trick.
and we form it just a zip lock bag or a little piece of plastic works.
great for keeping all those things off your counter.
so i 'm going to mix are celery and onion in with our ground beef.
so i make and we want to mix this really, well, we 're going to form this into four patties, and we 're going to make sure everything is mixed in nice.
if you want all your patties to be the same little trick is to have a scale.
you can set your scale for the ounces that you want a six ounce burger, seven ounce burger, eight ounce burger, and then performing are burgers.
so they 're all the same.
we use a ring and this actually this ring makes a perfect six ounce burger.
and i 'm just going to set that on top of our plastic wrap, put my ground beef in the center just put a touch more on top there.
we want to fill it right to the top taken turn that over that are burger out.
this is an eight ounce burger.
sister pretty hefty burger.
it is delicious.
when grilled makes a great sandwich for two.
another little trick we can do here.
so we want to make a couple of small burgers for the kids just take a little bit make a couple of little tiny burgers here.
now remember when you 're getting ready to cook your burgers, you then again want to season am with a little salt, and i like to season high up that way there.
it 's evenly distributed over the top of the burgers.
so we do n't have a lot of salt in one spot put a little bit of pepper, and this is how to make a juicy hamburger with lean ground beef again.
