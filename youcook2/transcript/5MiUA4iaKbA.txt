everybody tin man here looking to my easy cooking channel today, i 'm going to make some steak and shrimp kabobs what i have here is a pound and a half, a stew meat and actually use that in a crock pot recipe.
the other day, and it was really good meat after i brown did.
i was just eating it like that, so use it for my kabobs, and i 'm going to marinate it in this garlic and herb marinade.
and i 'm also going to unthaw some of these thirty one forty shrimp and off of him and, uh, put the shrimp in that same garlic, and herb marinade.
OK , this is going to be really simple.
that 's the way I like it.
still meets all cut up already.
so i just poured some of that marinade on it, all, i 'm doing with these shrimp is kind of ransom water over tenth on a little bit, and i 'm just pulling the pull on the shell off like that, and dropping them in a bowl of marinade.
OK , my meats been marinating here for about an hour and a half two hours.
and it 's looking really good, i put the shrimp in the fridge because the shrimp cook faster than, than this will.
so i figured by letting this come up to room temperature and put in the shrimp in the fridge.
it 'll help equalize the cooking time a little bit.
i 'm going to use these middle schoolers that i bought.
it 's easier thread.
the meat on these metal ones.
OK , i 'm doing everything the easy way today.
so i 'm using my gas grill will just cook these and tell the shrimp turn, pink, which should n't really take too long OK.
it 's been about seven or eight minutes have been moving these around a little bit.
it looks pretty good to me.
i think it 's about time to get him off of their looks, like these surf and turf kabobs turned out great, it 'll veggies on these babies just pure meat.
and i 'm starving so i 'm going to dive into these things thanks for watching you guys.
and i 'll talk to you next time.
