we 're making my beef.
bulgogi so first we 're going to make our marinade for beef, bulgogi and i love the flavors in this sweet salty and then when we grill it later, nice smokiness as well.
so just into a food processor i 'm going to be adding in some pears now.
i 'm just using a normal pair, but if you can get your hands on a nashi pear the ones that look almost like an apple, use them.
instead , they 've got such a wonderful flavor also going to be adding in some chopped onion.
some garlic cloves for sources.
i 'm just going to add in a few drops of sesame E oil for some saltyness.
some soy source, i 'm also going to be adding in a dollop of honey, as well, and i 'm also going to be adding in some socket as well, which is japanese rice wine.
you could just use water as a substitute as well now.
we just want to combine this in the food processor until you can see here.
we 've got a nice puree that this is exactly what we 're after enough live is n't here.
i just incredible.
so now i 've got my thinly sliced steak here, now.
the steak i used today.
the beef was the porterhouse cut.
now you can use scotch.
fillet , rump the top side.
it 's completely up to you.
so what i do to get a nice even cut on the beef i just pop it into the freezer just for a couple hours, and it just makes it.
so much easier to cut through and get a nice even cut.
so now, moreover, that pureed mixture onto the beef and just mix the before and get it all nicely coated.
so we 're going to put this into the fridge.
now and marinate it for at least one hour.
but preferably you would do this overnight.
now another little tip, you can make this head of time, you could put this into a zip lock bag and put it in the freezer and then you can just bring it out when you want to use it over high heat on the stove or barbecue plates beef in ansia you want a nice caramelization on the beef, and cook in batches for only one to two minutes served with rice or kimchi and sprinkle.
some sesame E seeds over the beef to serve, and now let 's get stuck into this bad boy.
so i just love this dish.
and we have n't quite often be cause it is just packed full of flavor from top to bottom.
and we serve it up with some rice, you can serve it up with some kimchi, if you wanted to.
but we love it with rice, we soak up all those beautiful juices from that marinade that we had that.
we made before that 's open to be fair, but in any case, please give this a try.
it is truly one of those dishes where you eat it and you just sit back and go.
the flavors here adjust wonderful, and it becomes one of the staples only i 'm going to guarantee it that you will have this more than once it 's cheap to do easy to put together and very, very easy to make, give this one a try you 're going to absolutely love it.
