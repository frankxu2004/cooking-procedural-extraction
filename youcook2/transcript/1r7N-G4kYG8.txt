hi , welcome to my home kitchen.
i am bored now and today i 'm making tomato soup in within ten minutes and here is the handy list of ingredients to make the tomato soup.
so i 'm cutting here.
the onion chopping the onion and using the word onion, but you can use any onion that you want.
so i 'm just going to roughly tap the onion on the other side.
i have the pan heating on the medium temperature alright, so the onion is done.
and into the pain, i 'm going to add.
but are about a tablespoon of butter and a little bit of olive oil and into the pan.
here goes the butter and the onion, and i have the cooking, only one here.
so just a couple of drops of olive oil right.
and i 'm going to give it up, please start here and cook the onion on the medium.
and while that is cooking, i 'm going to come over here and cut the tomato now when you chop the tomato.
make sure that you take out the seats if you want to save some time on taking office of the seat like when your soup is done.
you wo n't have to filter out.
so i just what i do normally is i take out the seeds and then chop saw as much seeds as i can.
so basically deseed the tomato if you do n't want to go through this step.
then once your soup is done, you can filter out because we want a smooth soup.
so somehow, the six needs to be taken out, and i do n't care about the skiing.
so i just take out the seeds and then good to go.
but if you do n't like the skin of the term it 'll certainly you can just cook and then filter out to make a smooth.
so i 'm just roughly chopping here.
tomato and i 'm going to add to the pan give a start games in between alright ready to go the tomatoes in chopping one more time.
so basically i am using two big tomatoes and quarter, the red onion.
so on one side, the camaro, in onion cooking and i 'm still another process of cutting the other half.
so all the tomato into the part.
now and here i had a vegetable prof that i 'm going to use.
so i 'm going to pour, i 'm just going to eyeball the two cups is just there enough.
so the vegetable bra, you can add water, but the vegetable cross brings the nice flavor.
so this looks good.
all right, now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to.
we 're going to add just a little sort to cook it faster.
i am going to cover it.
and i 'm going to hear one we saw just one reason is enough.
so basically i 'm using the pressure cooker.
so how are the pressure cooker in here the one we saw open pod, tomato does n't take too long to cook.
so , maybe just a four minutes five minutes that 's all.
but i kind of like to use a principal curve.
now , while i hear that we saw, i have here, the roasted bell pepper.
and it is roasted red bell pepper.
these brings up the nice flavor to any soup, i add this in the carrot soup tomato soup and vegetable through any.
so that i may just little, goes long wait.
so i have here ready road state.
its flame roasted.
have a nice smokey flavor as well right?
so i 'm going to take out and you can make your own roasted bell pepper as well.
just chop it off, late so i 'm going to quickly run my knife through this roasted bell pepper and keep it on side.
this is done easy.
so i just heard one.
we sold so i 'm going to turn off the store and allow it to cool down natural, or you can just or you can take this pressure cooker under the running to border and cool it down my pressure cooker has cooled, down naturally.
now i 'm going to add this, roasted red bell pepper smell, so good.
i have n't spice it up the air quest, oh, great smell aroma here.
all right now i 'm going to use my phone grandeur look at that.
red bell pepper looks good and carefully blend so look at this looks creamy soup already, now.
it 's time to spice it up here.
i had to call powder with parsley.
so little bit of that, and here i have the paprika so pepper rica brings up the nice flavor.
and here i have the brown sugar.
this is totally optional.
but i kind of like to balance out the flavor of the sourness and just a little bit sweetness.
so now so i need a more salty can add more salt.
but you can give it a taste before adding solved.
because we added the salt while we boiled the tomatoes.
so basically just.
so piece already look at this.
now here, i have the heavy whipping clean this is totally optional, the soup is already creamy.
but i kind of like to add just a little bit of heavy queen and just a little amount will change the case, offers soap, just like any.
so just a little bit, that is, it an give me disturb, i 'm going to use this to take out the soup for myself and.
now to decorate your goal just or little bit of a make kind of round shape and then parsley or cilantro, whatever you can find just put that on a top just like that and look at that it looks delicious in very inviting i 'm going to taste heavenly delicious tomato soup.
just in ten minutes you can season your soup.
it just to salt and pepper, but, but i can apply to add more spice in it.
so i just spice it up with few more other things other than salt and pepper and the soup is very light.
so you can solve this soup with the sandwich.
what i normally do i make the garlic bread, which is very quick and easy, so, garlic bread goes very, well with it in today.
i 'm going to use actually.
the hawaii sweet, what you can do is you can just bake them at three hundred fifty degrees into the auburn just cut them make two slices and then cut them, and then just pop into the R.
one at two hundred fifty degrees and bake till it gets, some just a little golden brown color and the magic it takes.
so deuces with this soup, and if you want to make the sandwich, you can make it in the sandwich.
i would like just kind of work, are you can make out of this hawaii sweet roll?
so , however, you like again.
so this, so quit, and if you are a big fan of soup, just like me i make.
so often and that 's the only thing that i like to have mostly in the afternoon for the launch by light lunch and is to impress my kids.
so they can have the super slow i keep like a macaroni, like a very small tiny one that comes you can find in the section where there is a soup on one side and soup products on one side and the other side it will be this small type of these, and it comes in different shapes.
it comes even in the alphabet star and shows it 's a very small shell.
so you can buy different one and i always keep whatever ship.
i find all the shapes, and they cook up so fast.
it 's take maybe just a half of meat or something to cook them up.
so you can just add into the soup.
this warm it up or just heat it up your soup and just works great.
or you can keep the croutons.
i always have carla coupons because that 's the one that i like most with some her, the garlicky, croutons with some herb.
i love that so anytime i make soup always sprinkle view croutons so you can spice it up more with some other.
i think so, so this is all about the tomato soup.
thank you for watching and i will see you soon with the next great recipe till that time.
keep watching all my other shows.
