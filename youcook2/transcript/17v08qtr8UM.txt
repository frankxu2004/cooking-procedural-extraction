gay guys, today, i 'm going to show you how to make a really quick simple and delicious appetizer so you will need for starters.
some bread, and some bacon.
now i 've cut these in the squares as you can see here.
you will also need some cherry tomatoes, which have been hard some lettuce leaves now you can use whatever type of letters you want for this.
some mayonnaise or any other condiment.
you desire some toothpicks and some butter.
so here i 've got a barbecue plate pretty hated to a medium temperature, i 'm just going to start by cooking up those pieces of bacon.
we want really good crispy bacon here.
and once the bike in spain turned i 'm going to start on the bread.
so for this, just spread some butter on the other half of the plate gently, place on those slices of bread and just put them down in the center and these will only take a couple of minutes to cook.
and once the bacon is done, just take it off onto some paper towel to drain turn over those pieces of bread and these will just need another minute, or.
so and they 're done as well, and it 's time to put this together.
so take one of your pieces of toast squeeze on a dollop of mayonnaise, a piece of crispy bacon some lettuce, and tomato and a toothpick.
and , that is all you need to do guys.
it is that quick and simple.
enjoy these are fantastic guys.
they are so tasty.
