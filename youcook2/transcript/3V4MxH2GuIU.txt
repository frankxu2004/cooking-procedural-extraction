hey there and welcome to another episode of cooking with john.
and this is my cooking show.
this week we 're going to be making something that is actually really simple to eat.
it 's very delicious, you could do it either in the oven in the grill and you can pretty much make this anyway.
you want today we 're going to be making chicken teriyaki, shish, kabobs, i 've got four chicken breasts.
red pepper green pepper jalapeno kuznicki light spicy, as well as a red onion.
i 'm also going to be using wooden skewers which are about a foot.
long you can do this one of two ways you can.
either you 're gredients together.
teriyaki sauce put him on the skewer thrown right on the grill.
but today, i 'm actually going to be letting a marinade for about an hour.
the teriyaki sauce and that way all that flavor will just kind of get saturated right into the meat right into the vegetables.
i 'm also going to be soaking my skiers and cold water for about half an hour.
so when i put the kabob on the grill the wood wo n't burn right away.
we really moist, and be really wet, and it will absorb a lot of heat.
dry out before it starts to just burn right away alright so the first thing that we 're going to do is.
take our red onion.
then quarters i 've already cleaned out the inside of the peppers you want to get all the seeds out the stem and all sorts of stuff in there and again we 're just going to cut this in half and set it aside, saying with the green pepper.
now we really just kind of want chuck.
so you can cut this in thirds and then again into pieces.
so we have nice little pieces of red pepper that we can stick on our shish , kabob.
and the same with the green pepper cut it in thirds and then cut your chunks into three pieces.
so i decided to pan that i wo n't make.
it all my vegetables up in with the chicken and teriyaki sauce.
i actually switched to a bigger pain because i have a lot of vegetables and next.
we take our red.
onion , and we do n't need to do anything else except just pull it apart, and pull that layer off.
and we 'll just throw it in chunk by chunk and this will be what you actually throw on the skewer.
now we 're going to cut up a jalapeno, yeah, we 're just going to go ahead not that into quarters and we 'll just do couple pieces to put on the skewers just like that, and.
next we 're going to slice are chick in ended chunks, an the larger part of the breasts in half.
i like to cut the tip off because it 's kind of a smaller piece.
once we cut the larger part of the breast in half.
we 're just going to cut the chicken in a nice small chunks, so it will fit on our skewer with our vegetables.
you can go ahead and throw those in with the vegetables going to get cooked so it does n't matter, that is touching the raw chicken.
and we 're done with this.
we 're going to go ahead.
and we 're just going to add teriyaki sauce to the chicken and vegetables, and we 're going to mix it all up and let it sit in the fridge for about an hour.
now comes the fun part where we get to add, are teriyaki two?
the vegetables and the chick in sometimes it comes out pretty slow.
but i 'm going to go ahead and use the whole bottle.
this is a lot of chicken and a lot of vegetables and now we just take all this.
and we mix it up by hand, and we just kind of massage.
the teriyaki sauce into the vegetables at end of the chick in make sure you get every single piece in there, working real good.
it just get a good coding on the vegetables and on the chicken.
i like this particular chicken teriyaki sauce about exactly sure what.
yes , but it 's pretty sticky is not very runny and it sticks to all the chick.
in , in all the vegetables really well, and you want to make sure that you really get in, you know, side the pieces of pepper like this, you have a corner just want to make sure you get all that teriyaki sauce in and around the whole pepper, and i 've spent about five minutes just really slowly.
but surely mixing up all the vegetables all the chick in all the teriyaki sauce i want to make sure that this stuff is just full of flavor and as you could tell irish is really, really excited about this video still at all i 'm going to use a shallow baking sheet it 's about half, an inch thick, it 's about a quarter inch full water, and the sticks will absorb a little bit of water.
but not much.
and i just need to make sure you have a pan that 's long enough to hold the skewers.
there are skewers have been soaking for about forty five minutes, the meat.
the vegetables in the teriyaki sauce have been also marinating for about forty five minutes.
the barbeque grill it start grilling, i show you one or two of these you do, the same thing for everyone.
so you basically you start.
anyway , you want i like to go onion.
green pepper, red pepper chick in, and will try to find a nice little piece of jalapeno, and i 'd like to put the jalapeno.
next to the chicken.
so the chicken will actually absorb a little bit of that spicy heat, and then we just repeat the process.
we go onion green pepper, red pepper chicken jalapeno, and alapi nose.
a , it 's a little bit smaller of a piece of paper, so you basically, you just want to turn this cure slowly on the jalapeno.
take it all the way through.
and that 'll poke a nice little hole through their onion.
green pepper, red pepper chicken jalapeno.
we will go ahead and top it off with an onion.
one thing you also want to be careful about is that you do n't poke yourself with the skewer.
these are very, very sharp.
but if you run it into your hand you 're probably in end and poking yourself so bad that you bleed, i have a pan here.
i 'm just going to take him.
and i 'm actually just going to set him across the pan like that alright so we got nine shish, kabobs out of that.
we 're going to go ahead.
we 're going to throw it on the grill for, oh, i do n't know ten to twenty minutes till the chicken is nice and cooked in the vegetables are soft and delicious.
the grill is hot.
the kabobs are skewered.
and i 've got a nice cold beer.
if you 're twenty, one years of age or older in the united states, there is nothing better than drinking an ice cold one.
will you do a little grilling.
so we 're just going to take our kebabs were going to put him on a red hot grill side by side, holy cross and a lot of times when i 'm grilling?
really would not appreciate that we have our teriyaki chicken.
shish , kabobs on the grill will do amount about five minutes.
aside will flip am five minutes flip in five minutes put in five minutes.
and they 'll be on for about twenty minutes.
i 'm going to cover him for the first ten minutes to keep all that heat inside and let me tell you what this is going to be absolutely delicious.
later they been on for fifteen minutes, i think they 're done, we 're going to go ahead and take him off.
you can see we 're getting a lot of this nice char there all the chicken looks nice and done.
it would take him off and put him in my pants and then we 're going to enjoy and there is the final product.
and i like the pole all the ingredients off of the skewer, you can leave it on if you want.
but let 's go ahead and give it a try and see how it takes, or that 's true.
delicious hum, so good, that is, such a great combination of flavors and let me tell you what you guys are really going to enjoy these absolutely.
