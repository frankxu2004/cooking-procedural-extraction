we have two tablespoons of chopra shoot, though this, you can omit if you 're a vegetarian i like to put in.
pursuit look is a nice little meaty flavor to it.
i have two tablespoons of diced onions.
i have a quarter cup of grated parmesan cheese have maybe a tablespoon of butter handsome, black pepper i had some parsley here.
have at quarter cup of heavy cream i have two cups of warm marinara sauce?
very important, this is what gives it a great flavor if you do n't have prepared marinara sauce.
if you do n't know how to make it.
i had the recipe in the cookbook, and if not you can always buy jar of marinara sauce in a grocery store, and here i have about tables, two tablespoons of vodka sauce.
so let me get this can go in.
here wanting to get hot that the pasta cooking.
here i 'm going to put in also navy a tablespoon of olive oil i 'm offering too much is going to have the pursuit that 's going to render itself.
so i wanna put pro sciuto in first.
let 's get that going, i, wanna put the truth.
is you really want that for shooter cooking to rent it down all the fat going to see a nice and golden gas?
and as it 's getting golden thrones discontinue not in as nice sweetness to say the sweetness of the onion.
you have the saltiness of the shooter, which is like a match made in heaven.
it 's a little bit of butter in.
here your help cook when i do like to pull parsley in right away.
those pages salt in i did n't add any salt.
pinch , A penny sorters recipe.
i think the pursuit there 's plenty of salt, too.
it 's not only think you need any, if you want to add a touch you can.
but as i said, you 're going to be putting in the grated cheese also.
so that 's going to add nice for that.
she wanted you want to get these unused little golden.
you want this pursuit little red yourself and get a little crispy.
also , i got this cooking, works for prosser.
here make sure that classes start every thirty seconds or so, so it does n't get stuck not very important.
we 're making vodka sauce.
bok is very flammable.
so what you wanted you are pulling off the fire.
add your vodka and let it ignite now.
what 's happening here is the boss.
is actually burning off what the optimal to burn off once yacob result.
completely you 're still having flavor the boxer.
just kinda square let it burn off boston, burned off.
source , code going to add the heavy cream to it.
and i 'll let that cook down for some seconds now.
i want this to come to a boil.
the marinara sauce is already cooked.
so this should take about a half a.
minute , or so to cook this probably going to be enough sauce for two to three portions.
i think this would be more than enough, let me see, if i can get this thing to cook see this process is doing here.
when did this start up a little more seems like we like to make our box, which most little bit page?
this heavy cream has a lot of nice hash.
another nice color , too.
it adds a nice layer of flavor to it.
that 's really good.
possibly like the coke aldente by five to six minutes.
if this passes ready, so what i 'm going to do the numbers passed out into our stranger in about a half a pound of pasta.
here so let me show you.
what we do with the pasta.
i 'm going to put it all back in, in the span.
i like to toss the pasta with the program.
she 's in with the sauce.
OK , now i think this is too much sauce for this POS.
so what i 'm going to do is i will let this go for another thirty seconds.
or so let this really bubble up and really well.
it 's also limited with the pasta here.
i 'm going to probably in about a half of this motion to it, so what you 're doing here is a POS, is getting really, really wet trust.
what we do here is that our grated cheese iterating farmer, john.
we just heard up and what you can do here, also, you can cook the pasta.
bella terra fifteen seconds in the bowl.
but it really get wet shirt around.
if you have any extra parsley can pinch it apart from there.
OK , so what i 'm going to do is i want to play it.
all right now if you like a little bit of sauce i like not put too much sauce on it.
but what you can do is you have any sauce leftover years later that right.
now let me just put this right on.
i , have a little bit more parsley and related parsley on top the lower grated cheese touch.
grated cheese, and there you have it.
