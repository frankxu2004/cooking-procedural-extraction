this is men and today.
i 'm here to teach you how to make chicken boogie.
i thought i would try to show you my mom 's way to do it, which means i have to kind of figure out.
i 've had to figure out the measurements.
one of the reasons why i like chicken, boo, boo, go over the beef, one so much.
one has like the typical soy sauce.
garlic ginger and a little bit of sugar, or honey for sweetness, but the one they use for chick in it has a hot pepper paste.
this hot pepper phase already took some out is very red.
it 's very spicy pasty, so, well.
my mom used it with chick in i remember liking it better 'cause of spice here.
and she just made it less often.
so salt like those more special when she made it.
so first choice of meat can be chicken thighs and here we have for chicken thighs.
but you can also use two chicken breasts instead if you want to go on a lower fat route systems the hot pepper paste, as i 've already said, and that 's about.
i wanted to say a little over one third cup little bit of honey instead of sugar and i would say.
that 's about one third of a cup that 's been sitting out for too long outside and then here we have chunks of ginger, and i 'll show you.
guys had a chocolate ginger.
this is n't as fine as it could be.
but if you do n't mind a couple of junk that 's fine.
also , if you do n't have fresh ginger, you can use i prefer not to.
but if you have this around and not, some fresh ginger, that 's fine same thing with garlic.
we have about one tablespoon about two tablespoons here of garlic again.
you can use granulated garlic and set.
i prefer fresh the one tablespoon of soy sauce, and i guess one tablespoon of sesame E oil, and we 've almost run up.
i 'm just going to pour straight out of the bottle and then one teaspoon of black pepper ann, four stalks of green onions that were going to top in.
in the end and before we get started i 'll show you how to chop up ginger, it looks really hairy and weird.
once you chop off all the outside woody parts, and it looks like this, and it looks like it 's hard to chop.
but on this really not.
so you do it against the grain like this, and it 's all hairy.
then , you get the bottom end of a nice pressure you could go a little finer.
if you 'd like, but i just do n't know like doing that also you could use a food processor.
but after you do, that is to just put more in there.
and the same thing with garlic, you should squish it like that to release all the juices.
and then this problem.
finer , if you 'd like, but you do n't have to.
if you like it, chunky a little bit OK.
let 's get started on the assembly alright.
this is n't very TV pretty 'cause.
i do n't want to do as many dishes.
once we 're done OK, so first take place only.
OK , sorry, you should sometimes do that OK.
so first take your PC ingredients and then put it in your pool, and if you do n't have money.
but you have like brown sugar or white sugar, you should use a little less than shown here.
but it should still be fine and then voicing.
maybe it, it makes it a little bit.
so i spooned over thought and one tablespoon of sesame E oil.
it pepper ginger google couple of garlic.
then , we mix it up a little bit.
and then, and then for the green onions instead of chopping a lot, i just like sing my shears, kitchen shears 'cause it makes it a lot easier.
and i also like using green onions instead of onions.
so there 's less liquid when we 're cooking on the stove or if you 're grilling, i guess if you 're using a grill pink or green onions.
last taylor, two green onions restart.
i want to get to the wider part.
i like to put it in half and start cleaning 'cause that part that bit stronger.
OK an issue still really spicy and sweet.
OK , i 'm not going to put it into for.
now and now that the marinated size i 'm gonna take our chicken pieces and then third consuming the fat off and then shopping against the green as well for the fat and just kind of put it here, and i know size are fattier cut of meat.
but i like the way it tastes better with this marinade.
but again, we 've done it with chicken too.
so that 's not a huge deal.
so and then.
so you see the green happening going this way right.
so you should cut about how big would you see, this is half an inch thick, long strip chicken by.
OK , so i just got done trimming the fat off of the four pieces of size and sure they are.
and then we 're almost done on now they 're just going to sit like this in the fridge for an hour.
i mean, earlier this week when we make.
this we just proud hated immediately takes a perfectly fine.
and it was really good with lettuce wrap, and we 're going to do that again.
but today since do n't worry, i mean, it 's not dinner time yet looks like i 'm feeling much earlier.
so i 'm going to let it marinate and it always does pizza little better.
one of marinades, they think anyway, so we 're going to let this marinate until that time.
and then i 'll show you how you can fold up a lot of straps, you can enjoy this with whether it 's romaine lettuce or green leaf or red leaf or butter lettuce with white rice either sticky rice for long grain or brown rice.
we 've done it all and it all tastes really good.
so let this area will come back when we start cooking.
OK , so my husband heard me struggling with the stove top.
so he came to rescue not for my rescue.
so i have it on medium heat right.
now with about a little less than a tablespoon of oil, and we 're using a really small skillet use, a bigger one.
if you have it, we have a bigger one.
but the non stick has like straight dog with time, and it 's pretty terrible.
so i do n't want to use our old fintan.
try to trip balls from there it a little and then i think we 're going to cook about half at a time and i hear it sizzling.
so have a clean parents upset through images, world cup.
i do n't always do that.
but i thought i would try to keep being clean, our dog is watching us.
she 's only sagging you ca n't eat this kelly, so here, the you should take this off here.
the three main components of the rap i guess, with some right, and we have some lettuce here.
we have the romaine lettuce so you would take a couple of pieces.
i like a little more than this guys.
but depends on your preference little mound of rice or a lot, depending how much you can fit in stuff to eat this on terra and then like a small bite of chick.
in we are we, like spicy raw onions and you can also have raw or cooked large chunks of garlic, you can have slices of cooked or raw jalapeno peppers depends again on your preference, and here, we have the dipping sauce, and it 's called sometime or smiled soybean.
paste has been fermented.
heater was a lot of other meats that are laughable and lettuce too, so basically it 's like some sleeping, pay some like garlicky flavor stuff like that.
do you put it on there as best as you can, with all of your ingredients?
amanece eat it, ah, on all right so.
these letters graph there really good way to enjoy barbecued meats, or like cooked, korea meets with like a couple of other raw vegetables if you 'd like, i hope that you enjoyed watching it and that you 'll try it, and he 'll let me know how it goes.
