hello , alone today we 're going to learn how to make hiyashi, chuka rahman, this is chilled chinese rahman, and this stuff is awesome.
this really is an awesome summertime dish.
so the first thing we 're doing is, we 're taking a cucumber.
and we cut it in a little bit less than half and then we 're going to cut it and very, very thin slices.
and as i mentioned, this is such a refreshing summertime food.
specially , when it 's really hot out this is wildly popular in japan.
i , you see this, so much in the summer time.
it is just excellent.
so definitely, if you have n't had it before now is the time to try to have it because it is excellent, so here.
what we 're doing is we 're taking those very thin cucumber slices and cutting into very thin strips, as well, you know, this is eventually going to be on top of our rama noodles and.
so we want to try to cut it as cleanly as possible, even though the cucumber does get a little bit slippery and it can be difficult.
but that 's what we 're going.
for , really, really thin cucumber slices, like.
so , and once we have that, that should be good enough the next step is.
we 're going to cut up a tomato, definitely going to cut the end off first and then go ahead.
slice it in half an we 're just going to make wedges here very, very well i just lied.
we 're going to make thin slices.
i take that back.
but the thin slices once again this is going to be another condiment on top of our rama, noodles and really, really with the cucumber and the tomato and the other things we 're going to put on top.
just a nice chill watching launch or dinner.
so once we have our tomato over the next step is we 're going to take deli sliced ham.
go ahead and cut that in half, fold it over, and then we 're going to take these handpieces and just cut them into very, very thin slices.
like so and once we do that we will be just about done with our condiments.
but it is worth noting this ham does n't need to be super special.
there is a very standard, japanese ham slices.
we get, but really any ham slices will do what so, ever so.
this is what the two kahraman looks like, and just look for the robin package that looks like it has a bunch of cold stuff on top of it.
that 's what you 're looking for now.
we have boiling water, and we 're going to take the rama noodles and put it on top.
really you just kind of mix it around rama noodles definitely read the package, but typically, especially for the chilled ones.
these are n't like the hard dried ones, these only take about two minutes three minutes.
max , now we 're going to go ahead and mix them in with very cold water.
like so, and how we lost her big bowl for the day i think someone borrowed it so we 're doing it.
the salad bowl and a strainer like.
so , but you just have really, really cold water in there, and you just mix it around, and just keep mixing, mixing, mixing.
this will give you your chilled noodles like you 're looking for.
and once we have our noodles chilled we take it out.
shake it around and put it on a plate now.
the next thing to do is we 're going to take our children, gredients and put it around on top of the noodles like.
so do we have the cucumber.
we have the ham slices.
and we actually went ahead and scrambled and AG, as well and cut it into thin slices, too.
and we go ahead and put the tomato not quite wedges on it as well, and that 's what we want to look like then, we 're going to take the sauce mix that comes with rama noodles and just pour it all over, on top.
an there you go in the sauce is delicious too.
and that 's what it looks like this is the hiyashi, chuka rahman and it is fabulous.
