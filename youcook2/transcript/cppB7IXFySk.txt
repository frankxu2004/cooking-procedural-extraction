hi , everyone, welcome back to another episode of honeysuckle catering today.
i 'm going to show you how to make another fast and easy appetizer.
the pot stickers who want those frozen package pot stickers when you can make him fresh in no time.
i 'm going to show you how to still them, steam them pan fry them all in one swoop.
let 's get started.
you 're going to need half a pound of ground pork.
two cups of napa cabbage leaves finally chopped stocks of onion finely chopped about a teaspoon of ginger.
finally mens and then a whole shallot finely chopped as well and to stuff your filling in you 're also going to need one ton wrappers, i 'm using these giosa, rappers that circular an really easy to handle you want a mens all the ingredients very finely.
so that when you mix it together with the ground pork, it 'll just come together very nicely you do n't want big chunks of onions, or ginger when you bite into your pot stickers for filling you 're also going to need a tablespoon of xiaoqing wine, which is like dry sherry.
if you do n't have this, you can use a tablespoon of socket, a substitute, or even orange juice, a tablespoon of sesame E oil, two tablespoons of soy sauce, half a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of sugar and a dash of black pepper for this recipe.
all you have to do is dump all the ingredients i just listed in huge bowl and mix it well, i 'm going to use my hands.
because it gives me more control over the mixing process.
now to fill your pot stickers first take a won ton, wrapper and then about a teaspoon of your filling, put it in the middle and then with a bit of water you 're going to want to put it on the won ton wrappers on the edges.
this will act like glue when you pinch it together and then purse it.
you 're going to create cleats that 'll help hold the one come together during the cooking process.
this recipe is going to make about thirty pot stickers.
now take your pot stickers and line them up in the frying pan, put it on the stove on medium or medium high heat.
now take a cover and put it on the frying pan three minutes.
you 're going to be seeming the pot stickers at this point after three minutes of past.
remove your lid and let the rest of a water.
evaporate once the water is evaporated.
you 're going to be frying the pot stickers with the leftover oil from the pan fry it for two to three more minutes until the bottom is golden brown.
you should be able to just remove it easily and there, you have it, your crispy, potstickers see.
the bottom is nice and golden brown from the frying and the top is steamed.
the meat inside is fully cooked now, so not that so for the dipping sauce.
i like to make little bit of soy sauce and sesame E oil and a little bit of sugar just to balance it out.
but you can use any kind of dipping sauce.
you like, like teriyaki, ponzu, even sweet and sour would be really good, too.
the filling came together really well, you have cabbage in there, which helps to keep the pork morning.
