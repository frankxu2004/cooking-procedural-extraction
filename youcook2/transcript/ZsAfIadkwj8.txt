my name is bechard.
i 'm from many quiche and a quiche eleven time bakery and today.
we 're going to talk about banking homeless, the traditional way we start with homeless dried chickpeas this is in its drive home and it 's very traditional becaus it 's an ingredient that you can keep from year to year we soak it in water overnight for the legume to absorb the water, and they expand and then we cook it for a couple of hours for the chickpea to become meshed homeless.
can be eaten in many forms?
we 're going to talk today about making it with heidi, almost better haley.
so we start with the peas as you can see here very well cooked.
and we work with it.
we start by footing something.
haney , the quantity of the heynis about one fifth of the quantity of the chick peace, now bring garlic into it and some sorts.
this is a great way of crushing garlic.
really factorizes gives it smaller face.
when you mix it with the food, add a bit more salt and the same volume of fresh lemon juice.
as you put the haney with it the traditional way is to use the same mortar that you use to crash the garni.
we are working with homeless that just came off the stove.
it 's a great way of serving homeless with haley warm, a lot of the product that you find in the supermarket, which is not.
so bad, is product that 's being refrigerative, and it 's a completely different flavor than the warm homo santa haney.
of course, hamas with ohanian australia has become quite a popular dish.
i do n't think there is a supermarket or deli that does not serve homeless, or cell phone was in one home and in another from the really commercial product that you find already pre packaged in the supermarket to the local cafe that makes its own home bush, i mean, we feel very proud that the homeless is.
now being served in australia, gardner should be a bit of hot chili.
i 've used some of the chick peas whole that were not mix.
it gives it a nice presentation.
and of course, something that now australia takes great pride in producing olive oil, olive oil brings out the flavor and makes it so much more appetizing.
and , of course we take great pride in lebanese olive oil, but also in australian only avoid.
this is very popular traditionally, in the villages where you would cook you 're homeless and serve it straight away.
it 's very popular.
little cafes, where they would have a big pot of the homeless cooking.
and as the diamonds come in there, grab a scope of the homeless and do exactly what i did and they would serve it fresh that way as a breakfast dish of course, you would have it with bread and with a lot of fresh produce.
it 's available throughout the year.
the eating experience becomes a lot nicer.
when you are having it with a different flavors of pickles and fresh in vegetables, so this is for moose.
i think it 's a great dish.
i 'm very proud of it.
i do n't claim that we invented it, but definitely we should know how to enjoy it, and we wish everybody would enjoy it as we do.
