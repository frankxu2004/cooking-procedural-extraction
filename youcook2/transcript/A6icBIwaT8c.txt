needle dishes featured prominently on most chinese takeaway menus and this is my version of the most popular singapore noodles.
it 's one of my absolutely favorite easy meals, got all the delicious flavors, has got sweet sour fiery is just delicious?
and actually what really makes this dish.
really stand out is the use of the rice noodles.
so i 've got some here.
they 're really been presoaked.
and they 're lovely in springing just ready to use work on oil in that nice words, adding all these ingredients, and it pays to get all the ingredients prepped before hand.
because once the work is going, you do n't really have time to stop and shop.
so in first in virtually handful of the mushrooms and then in with a little bit of time right.
now this stage do n't worry if the walk is a little bit drying.
you think all the ingredients are sticking, and might be burning just keep, staring very quickly.
because remember that slight smokiness.
so the catching of the ingredients just adds to the whole flavor.
and then in with some of the bacon for traditionally in the chinese restaurants be used child soup, pork roast pork, and that 's delicious and smoking almost sweet, and we add that in.
but you can cheat it with someone smoked.
even smoke and now going to add the cooked chicken breast.
these have just been boiled and then shredded in the end with the crunchy veg carrots.
now this page, you can also add a little bit of water to help create some steam to cook the vegetables.
i 'm gonna add the noodles.
thing is just to keep stirring and then keep mixing surround, and the time break that has coated the chicken and the bacon and ingredients will just coat the noodles nicely give it a gorgeous yellow color season.
with some dried chili flakes in with bean sprouts.
a little bit of a seasoning now got some oyster sauce.
two tablespoons, the good choices, sources, traditionally oysters, that 's been cooked up.
so they really concentrated really flavorful and bottle, few tablespoons.
maybe two of the light soy sauce smelling wonderful to looking great as well, lots of color and a little bit of rice vinegar just to add a little bit of salomonis to complement the fire.
in fact, you could just cook this with vegetables and some red wine vinegar that will work really well.
if you want a vegetarian version then little bit of toasted sesame E oil and then make a well in the center of the noodle whore in one beaten egg, you just give that a good stern.
the egg just coats the noodle as it cooks and then very finely in with some fresh spring onions movie, just stir that in nicely, thanks and ready to serve.
so i reckon it 's as quick to cook these singapore noodles with fresh ingredients as it is to order them from a takeaway and i 'm pretty sure that tastier and healthier with carrots are delightfully crunchy.
and i can just taste the woody.
earthy mushrooms, delicious really healthy, it 's quick.
and it 's tasty.
