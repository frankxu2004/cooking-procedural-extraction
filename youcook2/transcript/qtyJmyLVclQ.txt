hi guys, i 'm alarm italiane on this opposite of learning the kitchen.
i 'm going to show you how to make mashed potatoes.
but with a very, very delicious twist we 're going to make a rosemary infused roasted garlic to go with in it.
so , so good, i ca n't even describe it, but first thing you wanna do is roast the garlic.
and you want to create your oven to phone in degrees.
get there either way second thing you can do is, take two heads of garlic.
and we 're just going to cut them in half just like so you want to expose the actual garlic clothes.
awesome going to put them on here bottom side down touch of olive oil on them bring a little salt perfect.
and then we 're going to take some rosemary, cut it in half and what that 's going to do is infuse the garlic with rosemary, and it 's.
i ca n't even describe it a little more auto boyer.
want to keep things.
very , very moist, the tops back on he can.
just , they do n't go perfectly on there just make him fit touch more.
and you just want to make a nice tight package, just like that.
and you want to put these in the oven, four hundred degrees for about forty five to fifty minutes until the garlic clothes are very, very soft and kind of golden.
and they 've gone really, really naughty, and delicious now, while the garlic is versing in the oven.
we 're going to work on his peeling, are potatoes and getting them to cooking?
and i 'm just using a regular sort of baking potato, you can use any kind of potato you want.
and if you know, if you using like baby you ca n't golden little tiny ones, you do n't even have to bother peeling them.
i do n't know why i 'm doing all the appeals here.
when i specifically have a little plate for the peels now, what i 'm going to do an i 'm not going to cut the potatoes really big, i cut them in half.
i leave them kind of big because i love using a potato ricer to make these really fluffy kind of.
i do n't like lumping mashed potatoes.
if you do you can just use a regular steam standard sort of master and just match them to the consistency.
you , like i like my super, smooth and fluffy, so i 'm going to use a potato racer.
i 'm just going to cut these in half any little bit.
that 's left over i do n't worry about it.
because the potato reiser actually catches it from going in from getting kind of, pure rate up is going to put that place.
so i 'm just kind of you.
my potatoes, and i 'm going to cover them with water looking until they 're nice and fork tender.
if they 're kind of big like this, will probably take about thirty minutes or so?
you kind of smaller, just take a lot less.
i just took some cream and butter and have melted here in the same pain.
i used to cook mashed potatoes.
my potatoes, i should say not matched.
yet these are my potatoes that have cooked it turn out tender and garlic, and rosemary is out of the oven, and letting it cool for just a few minutes when i mash my potatoes and using a reiser.
this is one of my favourites, tools in the kitchen.
i 'm just going to get my potato see that this makes the potatoes.
so incredibly fluffy.
it 's unbelievable and like i said, i love a good fluffy, fluffy potatoes.
not lumpy my ass potato.
just wanna make sure to scrape anything that 's been left behind perfect alright, sending this aside next the unveiling of the garlic smell.
so amazing, oh, look at that now.
it 's like garlic handian, all you do is just squeeze, and it comes right out.
and it comes out tasting like sweet kind of nutty.
oh , it 's just so good.
so , so good what i often do is i make a few of these, then i saw him alongside like a toasted baguette and then you just spread it on it, it 's like butter.
so amazing, so good.
so just squeeze all the garlic cloves into mashed potatoes.
last pic, just like my fingers and so infused with that rosemary is amazing.
OK , we have this now.
we need to season it with salt and pepper because potatoes need salt to bring him back to life in my opinion.
they taste like nothing unless there 's some salt in their love lots of ground, black pepper with my mashed potatoes, however, my mother is like white pepper with hers.
so you can choose whatever you like.
and i have some cream and butter here.
and i 'm just going to mix this up.
that is amazing.
i do n't like a tube wet, mashed potato, either i 'm a very picky mashed potato eater minions, aces for seasoning.
right on the money, i left those garlic cloves kind of chunky, because i want to be able to literally bite down on one, then.
there 's an inviting going on.
so softap, but i want to be able to get a huge that club in my mouth.
because it 's not garlicky at this point is just like sweet , nothing.
so , and that 's about it.
i 'm just going to point this out so amazing.
i 'm just going to give us one more bite that is a dinner in itself.
so good so much flavor.
so comforting i could n't ask for anything better.
i hope you guys have enjoyed spending time with me.
