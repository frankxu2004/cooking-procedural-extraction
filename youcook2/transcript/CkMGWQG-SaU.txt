hello , and welcome to my kitchen, i am chef diane demayo and today, i am making a bon.
me sandwich, which basically is a vietnamese style sandwich, first, i 'm going to get my chicken out.
an as i always say, safety is your best friend gloves on chicken.
out i like to use by the way chicken thighs.
why , because chicken thighs, retain a lot of moisture, and it 's nice and yummy, whereas chicken breast they dry out chicken thigh.
skinless , boneless, the best, after i get my chicken in there and want to get lots and lots of garlic always garlic rocks your breath might not.
but it sure does taste good when it 's going in another garlic in here.
so we 're doing about two garlic cloves a tad bit of sesame E seed oil.
when i say tad bit, i mean, about two tablespoons.
we will use my fish sauce, which is busy about tree.
dash is which is about i do n't know one and a half tablespoons.
and that 's it.
my little salt, one teaspoon so give it a good mix.
and now we 're just going to set it aside to let it marinate generally speaking, you want to let meets marinate for about fights, a minimum half an hour.
make sure it 's in the refrigerator so it does n't get any food poisoning, or you do n't get sick good next.
we 're moving on to carrots when the secrets i like about making some type of pickled carrot, carrot salad as i always use a vegetable peeler i get nice shavings.
and if i get it into the bulb or actually going to do something here you go they do n't need much 'cause we really just making one sandwich watch.
obviously , this is, yeah, little bit of rice wine vinegar.
give it a little dabble to give it that nice.
based and so that 's it set that aside, let it rest, i already had my cilantro.
it 's been washed.
i always keep my herbs after i wash him in a wet paper.
towel and i put in a zip lock bag in the refrigerator, they can stay there for about two weeks.
always make sure you keep changing out the wet paper, towel fresh cilantro leaves i 'm not fussy.
i like my stem stems are super tasty.
i can really ca n't stand when they simply pick the leaves off and just use leaves no cilantro, siliceous when you use the whole peace.
but let 's get cooking.
now and get that chicken on the stove.
so i 've got my pan.
nice and hot.
i like using a skillet because it really charge them eight in little stupid that i have even though meat, will karma lies by itself?
i 've just top it off a little bit of sugar.
so it kind of seals in the juices, and it gets really nice and crispy and brown on the outside, so, yeah, little oil in there.
this pan is hot.
it 's already smoking you do n't want to waste time, and i do n't want to live in fire.
so in those mate look at the nice criminalization that 's going on with just checking that should really add to it do n't be afraid of your fire at home.
you always want to make sure it 's a claim is nice and hot steering is good.
all right, this is about ready.
she could also just you is tasted piece of it.
not so overly pungent with fish.
but the page that i like to keep a sesame E seed oil my sugar gets eaten ice health whip and literally sticks like butter alright.
i think it 's time to make that sandwich here.

you can use any bread that you want.
bree , osh sandwich roll.
i prefer to use french bread or italian bread.
so i use this and sometimes if i need to crisp it up.
i just put in the oven, it 's very simple.
we 're going to go here very carefully cut it open the first thing, i like to do with my sandwiches.
make sure that you kind of pull it open.
so it looks like a waiter a little butterfly.
but it down going to get a slather on one end of it, a beautiful suresh , ameo.
i like a lot going to put enough next, i 'm going to get my beautiful chicken liver patte and the other side of that bad boy, then i will lay, or some chicken on the inside of that.
