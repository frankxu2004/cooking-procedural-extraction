hi guys, today, we 're going to make a super healthy dish for a change.
and that is a salad and this salad is called for tush and is the lebanese salad, and by far my favorite salad of all time.
so let 's get started.
so all we need is spanish onion.
some freshly squeezed lemon juice, some ground, sumac, which you can find in most supermarkets.
some cherry tomatoes flatly passed lisa mint lebanese cucumber lebanese bread and olive oil.
before we get started, we need to preheat the oven and then put the lebanese bread in an oven tray for about ten minutes on a moderate oven.
so it goes nice and crisp and hard.
so first thing we do is we just chuck all these ingredients in that should be enough cucumbers, spanish onion.
the mint flat leaf parsley.
and we just keep that a mix, mix, and then we just give a little sprinkle of sumac and what i 've done here.
so just combined in a jar.
the only boil the lemon juice, and the sumac just give that a shake.
and we 'll just resolve that oh, over the salad, and once again will just keep that in lot.
OK , so i 've got the lebanese bread.
i 'm just going to sprinkle that on top, crush it up.
and then we just talk that through and if you have a little bit more, if you like.
so how easy was that a beautiful refreshing healthy salad.
so there you have it a beautiful refreshing salad.
one of the nicest servers you 'll ever have.
it is by far.
my favorite an the tanginess of the sumac and the lemon combine is so, so, refreshing and it 's.
so healthy and i 'm going to get stuck into this.
an icy next time , bye.
