so what you 'll need for this is one box of spanish rice one tablespoon of vegetable oil one pound of boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into half inch pieces one package of taco seasoning mix two thirds of a cup of water, one kind about fifteen ounces of black beans drained and rinsed one medium red bell pepper chopped third of a cup of sliced green onions.
half a cup of chopped fresh cilantro one package of flour tortillas for the burritos about eight thirty years.
he did one and a half cups of shredded cheddar cheese taco season cheese blend or mexican cheese, blend today.
it will be using cheddar cheese and some guacamole salsa and sour cream.
if desired so first of all, i have my large skillet here.
and we have it to medium heat, and all i 'm going to do is aunt in my oil.
so english soil.
let that get nice and hard and then we 're going to add the chick into that.
so once our oil is hot in our skillet.
let 's add in our chicken.
so we 've cut these into half inch little pieces, and we 're going to cook them for about three to four minutes until that no longer pink make sure to give them a stair occasionally.
so , once the chicken is no longer pink an.
it 's cooked for about three four minutes.
it 's now time to add in our water.
so it goes of water and the taco seasoning makes.
so that 's just going to give it lots of nice flavor in there, give it a step.
we 're going to cook that for another three to four minutes or until most of the water is absorbed, so our chicken is now done.
it should be nice and moist and not dry just house.
we want it, so, let 's get our bowl of rice and two.
are rice we 're going to add in the chicken mixture?
so , once the chick in is in that we can then add all remaining ingredients so a black beans going in there.
i just love full of protein and fiber are green.
onions of course are cilantro just going to give it a lovely freshness and are pepper in it.
all goes and then we 're going to give it a good, so all those flavors all mixed up together looking and smelling very colorful and fantastic, already great.
so here if you want to add any additional salt and pepper you can go ahead.
but that taco seasoning mix had.
so much flavor already that i 'm not going to need to put in too much alright.
so that is done so now.
it 's time to roll up our burritos lots of fun, so let 's get our flower tortillas, which we 've warmed according to package instructions.
i might just do one first.
all right so get your spoon.
and we 're just going to add in the middle will go down and will add about three quarters of a cup to a cup of the mixture inside.
get now on top of that.
let 's sprinkle on some of our cheese.
your cheese of preference of course on that, and then we 're going to wrap it up.
so from the bottom will rub over about an inch over the top of the mixture and then on the sides going to rap that over once wrapped the other side over.
so it covers the other side.
be careful because your dirty as might break up easily, and of course, then just rap on the remaining side, and if your dirty is a big, enough, they will fit do n't overcrowd your tears of course with the mixture.
because you want to fold them nicely.
so i can pop that on a plate and we 're going to do the same with the remaining thirty yes, perfect.
