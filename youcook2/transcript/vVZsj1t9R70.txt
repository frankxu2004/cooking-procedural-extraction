today , we are making chinese hot and sour soup with chicken.
the beauty of making this yourself is that you can control how hot or have showered is and how thick it is by the ingredients that you add.
so , the first thing you want to do is reconstitute some black fungus mushrooms, and this is what they look like when they 're dry.
and i probably have about two tablespoons.
it 's just like a little handful here.
and i 'm going to pour some boiling will be over them just to cover them, and our next step is to shred up the chicken.
and i just want to show you how i do it.
i have two chicken breast halves boneless here.
and i, i push down with my hand and then i push the knife through gently about a third of the way down when you get a thin slice like that.
i 'm going to do that again.
and i should get three nice thin slices now if you want to cut them.
thinner you can do another slice, it depends on the size of your chicken breast, and now the grain is going this way.
so i 'm just going to cut off little shreds like this.
and you can do this as stickers, then as you like.
i like thin shreds, if you wanted to do a larger piece, you could do this, and you get really nice thin pieces of chicken i just want to show you again.
i 'm holding my blade at about a forty five degree angle, and i 'm pushing it away.
that helps me get a thin slice and you could do.
this , with pork, too i prefer it with the chick in but if you want to do the pork, you could do the same thing.
now i 'm going to finish shredding those uf you need a sharp knife.
and then when you put in your knife through the breast to this way just be very careful not to slice your hand.
you 'll kind of feel where the knife is where the chicken is n't for your hand.
is i hope?
and you also want a sharp knife that helps.
so i 'm going to put this in the bowl here, and i have three tablespoons of soy sauce, and i 'm going to mix it in and see if it 's enough to cover it.
and if you have more chicken, if you have larger chicken breasts, you might want a little bit more soy sauce.
but it looks like it 's covering it here.
so we 're good.
now , i 'm going to sprinkle an equal amount of cornstarch.
i have three tablespoons of cornstarch, and i 'm just going to mix that in with my hand, and i 'm going to drizzle little bit of toasted sesame E oil on here as well, and it 's probably achieve spoon.
OK , are chickens ready?
so i 'm going to let it marinade while i chop up the rest of the ingredients.
so i 've drained my mushrooms and their nights, and reconstituted now, and i 'm just going to take a few, and i, i stack them up one on top of the other, and you just cut them into little strips just as you can get them, or if you want some thicker, you can cut them sicker.
but i like to cut them into little strips like that, and i 'm going to do it with the rest of them.
i have a twelve ounce block of extra firm tofu.
here you can use a software tofu if you prefer.
and i do n't think i 'm going to use the whole thing.
i 'm just going to start chopping, and i 'll see you want to stop talk to you.
how much talk for you like i 'm going to cut half of it first.
so i cut it into these slices here.
my stack them up, and then i 'm just going to chop down.
and i 'm going to get these little strips i think i 'll do it now.
i 'll leave him like this.
i do n't want them to fall apart.
i have an eight ounce.
can of sliced bamboo shoots that i 've drained?
and i 'm going to slice them into little strips like this.
i 'm going to do it for all of them.
i 'm going to use up the whole campus.
i do n't really have a use for the bamboo shoots other than in this recipe.
but if you want to use less it 's up to you, you can use less.
so i brought up about eight or nine cups of chicken stock to a boil, and i 'm gonna add the chick in the mushrooms.
the bamboo shoots and the tofu.
and i 'm going to cook them for a few minutes until the chicken is cooked through so the chickens cooked through.
it does n't take long because it 's shredded very thin, i 'm going to add a quarter cup of soy sauce.
i 'm using low sodium you can use full sodium and i have a quarter cup of rice vinegar.
i have two teaspoons of salt in three teaspoons of sugar.
but you want to taste your stock.
see how salty it is and how salty you want it, you might not want to add any salt 'cause the sodium from the soy sauce is probably plenty for most people.
and now i 'm going to add some white pepper, and i 'm going to do that to taste.
it 's very hot so, just be careful.
but , you know, you can just add a little bit taste and see if it 's hot enough for you.
and then i 'll show you the next step.
so , i added about a, a teaspoon of white pepper to mine.
it 's pretty spicy.
so you really just have to taste it and see how much is enough for you.
just go slow and now i have two tablespoons of cornstarch that i downloaded in a half a cup of cold water.
and i 'm going to add this to the soup, and it should thicken it up if it 's not thick enough for you, you can add a little bit more cornstarch.
i 'm going to let it cook for awhile, and i 'll check if it 's thick enough for me.
so i ended up adding another tablespoon of cornstarch that i diluted with a tiny bit of cold water.
it thickens it, it makes it almost that gelatinous consistency that you used to getting up the chinese restaurants.
but i do n't like it to poopy, and it also depends on how much cornstarch ended up putting on your chicken.
how figure soup is going to get, and i 'm going to add some eaten eggs which will also think in a little bit.
so i have two eggs that gently beat with fork, and i 'll show you how to add them in a second.
i skimmed a little bit of the foam off of the top of the soup, and i 'm going to reduce the flame a little bit.
but i want it boiling that hard slow it down , OK.
and i 'm just going to gently add the egg and as i do it slowly, i just gently store.
i 'm using a fork you can use chopsticks or whatever you want you just want to gently stir it and you get these little ribbons of egg i do n't want to do it too.
and you get this drops, and now i 'm going to maybe let it stand for.
i do n't know twenty seconds just to legs cook through now maybe even less.
i think i might turn it off in a few seconds, and when i do that i 'm going to drizzle some toasted sesame E oil enjoy it to taste depends.
how much you like sesame E while.
but i think it makes a soup really good.
i 'm going to put in some sesame E oil, and i 'll show you the next step.
OK , so i 've turned it offen i drizzled about two tablespoons of sesame E oil, and i 'm just going to add a whole bunch of scallions that i chopped up, and i saved a little bit for garnishing the bowl when i serve it, i 'm going to stir it in.
and it 's ready to serve, so here 's our finished product or hot and sour soup with chicken.
i hope you enjoy.
