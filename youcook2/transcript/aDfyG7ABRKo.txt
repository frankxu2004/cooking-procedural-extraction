i went back to napoli big, causing the scenery, then they hit dances every time and saw.
but you have to do in order of the pennybacker that we do here at the restaurant.
we have a vodka heavy cream marinara sauce.
and i possibly, i mean, we 're going to do is we 're going to take one.
do you want to eat up an open?
we want to add the vodka.
this is what you put in instead of put it right back on a fire or flame up.
want to put it in the background.
a little bit if we do that we 'll add heavy cream let it reduce a little bit also as an option where you can do.
is you can add diced up the pieces of ham, which will add when you add vodka and you cream will put some ham in it and then will the matter do n't let out marinara sauce that we have made, and once you get it apart will let it cool down a little bit.
so it starts picking up and it will take pasta that we have blended in mega, don , mom?
