good afternoon, everyone thanks for joining us at kissy cook has all cooking school today.
we 're doing a pork fried rice and will make sure that we have all of our angry is that we need to do our recipe the term for that is, me simplot it means everything in his place.
so i want to make sure that i have my port.
i have my onions.
i have some bell pepper.
we have some care.
it , i 've got celery green onion.
some egg a little olive oil butter and garlic, and then i have a little low sodium.
OK , i 'm going to.
i 've gotta preheating nice walk over here, preheating this is a nice swiss diamond walk.
you can probably get here at kissy.
could , but you do n't have to use the wall?
you can use a stir fry skillet OK.
or you can use a saute pan OK now that i walk is nice and hot.
we 're going to add a little bit of olive oil roughly two tablespoon and a teaspoon of butter i love the combination of the butter and oil the butter is going to give me that flavor and a little browning on my meat and the other walls do n't cut that butter from burning oil.
OK , i 've got that incorporate it.
we 're going to add in our slivers of pork tenderloins.
ann i have roughly ten else is that we 're adding to our plants.
we work that guy around again with stir fried.
you want to make sure that you have minimum maximum need.
so we want to get this walk lights and hot.
and you can hear that still going into pants just constantly screw that guy and then around to meet up for you.
OK , when i start to add my vegetables i want to kind of make a whale in the center where i can add my vegetables, and my meat can continue to add some chopped onion.
half a cup, or so, give it a world.
we 're going to add our parents.
i had roughly a couple of care slice on the bias.
we give that guy world.
we 're going to add.
celery , and i want to add the veggies that have take a little longer to cook this firm or veggies.
so that 's why would my carrots and celery first, OK, get those guys disturbed.
i 've got some diced red bell pepper will add like soltane is a fast cooking technique.
i 'll let that simmer why go and grab my rice.
hey , back that fast so, i 've got some nice jasmine rice that we basically bold off or seemed off.
according to the directions on our packet you can use water.
so i use roughly two cups of jasmine rice and three cups of chicken stock brought that to boil, let that boil kind of role for about two minutes, turn it off cover the pan.
let it sit for twenty minutes, now that my vegetables are nice and stewart and started to saute.
we 're going to add some green onion.
there 's some chopped fresh growing.
i had two stocks of green onion and a tablespoon of our chopped fresh garlic.
now for a main slavery were going to get most of the flavor from the ingredients in the pan.
but for the rest of my flavor i 'm going to add some low sodium soy sauce.
and i have half a cup.
we had that right in to this.
i 'm going to add some of my theme white rice and just kind of flip it apart and about two cups of my cook rice.
this is coming together very nicely.
as you can see, this is not a long cooking process, starts crying and salting or really fast cooking techniques.
the important thing is that you want to make sure that the ingredients that you 're putting in your stir fry that you cut those as similar size as much as you can.
so there are cooking time is.
even i do n't want to have chunks that cares or my even my port too big to where it 's going to take more time for that pork to cook, and my vegetables get too soft or my rice gets too much.
it now that my rice and started to try we 're going to add.
i 've got two eggs lightly, beaten, i 'm going to add those in.
but i have to swirl these guys in so that they scramble and give me a little texture on my rice.
i do n't want it all in one clock, so let this summer for a second.
i 'll finish my seasoning with a little cracked black pepper right on the top here.
given a nice little toss, and we 're ready to play chopsticks aside, right.
and the center in this recipe here it will be enough to serve four to six people.
thank you for joining us at kissy cook, chef to why simmons.
