it is a very healthy soup.
one of my favorite soup, recipes, and this can be converted into a vegetarian recipe.
very easy to build a lot of different flavors going on and i think you might enjoy this folks, so let me show you how i do it.
alright start this minestrone super out.
we would add, but an ounce of extra virgin olive oil who are pot here.
and to that, we will season that up with some garlic about a tablespoon and a half.
a teaspoon of bay leafs a teaspoon and a half of oregano and a teaspoon of celery seed.
what we 're gonna do.
now is, we 're going to sweat out one white onion that i 've chopped up and for of the italian plum tomatoes that i have finally diced that with them going to add some tomato paste.
put in a small seven ounce.
can of tomato paste like such, and we 're going to want to do is just infuse these spices?
an will cook these onions until there translucent when this comes back.
i 'll show you the next step alright.
we got our onions and the main is and sweat it in there with the aromatics.
we 're going to add about a teaspoon and a half of black pepper into that we 're going to add one quart of beef stock.
you use vegetable stock.
if you wanted, and we 're just going to put that right in there, ratings after a boil, an i will show you the.
next step alright.
next step here is that two cups of white kidney beans , OK.
we now cooked are soaked white kidney beans or about forty minutes.
and now we 're going to do is we 're going to throw in two small potatoes that i have cut up.
and we put that right into the stock pot and along that will put in one cup of city cluster, and it needs to cook for about thirty minutes.
so we 're going to stir that around for a little bit.
but that cook for a minute and i 'll come back and, show you the next step at about another quart of liquid to this.
we 're about halfway through the cooking of the pasta in the potato.
i 'm going to throw in.
some washed and chopped kale about a cup and a half.
the wild right to the stock, along with that.
i 'm going to add in one zucchini which i 've diced up and about three quarters of cup of just regular green cabbage.
and you do n't like some of these vegetables, you can leave him out.
this is a very healthy soup is vegetable to add labor to the broth.
and i said they are very healthy liesl well, down here.
as the sue cooks go about another six minutes on this and will be ready to salt and take this up.
so it will be back.
this is going to be good books, uh, the minestrone 's come together here quite nicely.
nice italian soup recipe going to put in about a tablespoon of some parsley, you had a little bit of olive oil at the end.
i like the taste of that myself.
and i 'm going to put some salt in now.
we could n't have salted yet and i 'd like to wait to the very end because it does make the being built up.
but in about a tablespoon and a half of this is some of this, would they call pink himalayan salt?
naturally pure, they say.
so we will use that today.
but you could use kosher salt sea salt just regular salt for this dish.
this is all cooked up now just try to play it up and give it the old taste test alright.
