hey guys, so today about to show you how to make some raw sauerkraut it 's super easy to do, and you only really need.
what ingredient, which is cabbage sauerkraut, is really good for your digestion and a lot of people do n't eat it because of the aesthetic E?
but i do n't have a problem eating this on my boyfriend loves it on sandwiches.
i love putting it on my salads at night, so you can use this green cabbage or red cabbage in the past.
we 've used the red, but i want to try this out this time.
so i 'll just show you the couple of things that you do actually need other than this, you 'll also need a mason jar, or some sort of glass jar like this.
the reason a mason jar works really, well, is.
because you can use these lids and the reason that you want to use those lives is 'cause you 're going to need, there 's some cheese cloth or some sort of breathable fabric that you can put over top, i 'll show you how to do that near the end there.
and that 's just what is actually going to help the cabbage ferment itself.
yahoo need a little bit of cecil.
i 'm not very much.
i think the salt just kinda helps soften the cabbage a little bit, so for those watching your sodium intake that 's what it 's for.
if you, i think that you can massage your kale up without it by all means, do it?
you need a big bowl to massage your cabbage in before it goes into your container, and the only thing you 're going to need is a knife to cut it up and some water.
so , let 's get started.
so this is half of the cabbage fairly large, and almost your house.
here , right now i 'm just going to add the sultan start massage, ing it in to try to break this down.
this does get smaller kind of like when you cook am kaler, spinach, or any greens, it just started to breakdown.
so i might need to do the other half.
but i might not.
so i 'm just going to start with this massage.
it , and then i 'll put it in to the mason jar, and if i need more than i 'll do the other half fact measurements very often when i 'm cooking.
so i 'm going to start off with about a tablespoon no fault, this is sea salt.
i 'd never use the iodize salt.
any of that crap sprinkle this in.
and i 'm going to start massage ing a little bit the last few times.
we made this we were using a recipe that called for some beet juice, and i think that, that just helps speed up the fermenting process, a little bit.
but we 're not doing that today this is just an extra spec.
it 's not completely necessary.
add some more out of cabbage.
i did n't cut my cabbage up.
because the night that i have is extremely, extremely dull.
but when there a bit smaller it obviously helps quite a bit tablespoons in a half you 'll know.
it 's starting to breakdown feel a little more liquidy.
and this is about as labor intensive as this gif.
i do n't know if you can see this starting listen a little bit.
he 's like cabbage.
if you 're doing with the rock kale salad, you have to just a little lemon juice or something to massage and break it down.
i 've never used lemon in his recipe, and i do n't know how it would affect the flavor of the sauerkraut.
but i feel like that would also help breakdown the cabbage if you do n't want to use salt.
so that could be maybe an experiment it 's listening now.
and it 's starting to go a little translucent.
so you can keep massage ing this for a bit, if you wanted to.
but i 'm just going to get it in a mason jar.
sorry , i do n't have better lighting for you guys.
if you have amazing drive that has a wider milthon step.
it is how much easier for you, or if you have a funnel.
i 'm going the zero or big portion of it will probably end up on the cutting board or the floor.
you also might want something like this to push lee sauerkraut down 'cause as you see is filling up quite quickly.
but there 's a lot of space in there will that fit persistent.
so as you can see.
i managed to fill up a second jar.
so half of a large cabbage is more than enough, like probably could have dropped a little more into this one.
but it wo n't push it now.
the next step is you 're going pour water, and you want to make sure that the water is above the cabbage line.
if you do n't put enough water in this, and it starts to firm it, it will create mold on top.
and you 're going to have to throw out the entire thing, so more water is better last time.
my boyfriend tried to do this, he did n't put enough in his shirt to get kind of gross.
now , as this ferments, it will release its own water.
so over the next few days, you 're going to want to just keep an eye on the water levels of your sauerkraut.
and do you notice then it starts to get too.
low , you 're just going to add a little more water OK, and if there 's any sarah credit on the side just push it.
so this is just a little piece of cheesecloth that i 've cut.
we do n't have this.
you can probably use like any hose or something else.
it just needs to be able to breathe.
i just put in little there.
we go type, and you 're going to want to keep these on your counter for the next three days every day is kind of getting a little check.
once they start to smell a little bit click vinegar you can put them in the fridge.
one thing that i forgot to mention it was that when your pudding the lids with a cheesecloth in here, you need to also have something to push the cabbage down into the liquid.
otherwise it will rise up and that can also cause mold when it 's starting to firm it.
so here i have a shot glass, and i 'm just using the strain from the cheesecloth to push it down, and in here.
i 'm using a spice bottle to push it down.
you can see it 's coming out the top if you can find something that is to fit the entire mouth of the glass that 's even better.
i do n't have anything but these will do.
kind of see that push the cabbage down enough and the liquid is up here so i hope you guys enjoyed this video on how to make brow sauerkraut.
