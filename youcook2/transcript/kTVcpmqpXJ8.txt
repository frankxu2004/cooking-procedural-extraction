my version of fast food at home, is japanese boudin, noodle soup.
and you use boudin noodles found in the asian market in the refrigerated section.
these are already cooked, and this recipe is from cat, cora.
you 'll need boudin noodles, or any type of noodles or dried pasta that you have broth miso paste and i used a combination of japanese mushrooms.
snow peas carrots and green onions.
so these are japanese who don noodles there wheat, based their thick.
they 've got a great chew to them.
i , i love that their thick and love the texture of them and these are already cooked so you 'll find these in the asian refrigerated section.
you can also find them dry as well, but i like these, 'cause it just takes a few seconds in to get them ready.
i always recommend cooking your noodles or your pasta in a separate pot of hot water not your precious suit.
because you can see it releases cooking the noodles releases some starch, and you do n't want that in your broth, OK.
this is meso paste.
this particular one is cheramie, so, which is white.
me saw it is the mildest of all, me saw it 's mild in terms of saltiness and intensity of flavor.
this is the one that i always have in my fridge erator at home, and it last for quite awhile in the frigerator.
it lasts for about six months in the fridge OK.
i 've got some chicken broth already going in this pot.
add my vegetables carrots.
i have snow peas as well, and you can use any type of vegetables you want just keep them very thinly slice.
so they cook really quickly, there goes my snow peas.
and then i 'm also going to add some japanese mushrooms as well to the spot you can, you shoot a key you can use.
these are shimeji mushrooms.
but anything really works.
here 's a trick to working with me, so you do n't want to boil the measles.
so what i do is i ladle some hot soup bowl with me.
saw paste, and then what i 'm going to do is use a whisk and whisk until everything is kind of the meso paste.
is kind of melted in with the hot soup, just like this, and then i 'm going to take that and add it to the pot and notice that my heat is off you do n't really want to boil the meso.
because it when you boil me.
so it just kind of gives it a gritty texture.
so this is a tip for you.
now i 'm going to add the noodles in and just kind of swirl it around, to let it heat up green onions?
and it 's done start to finish less than fifteen minutes, and you 've got a beautiful healthy warming.
boudin missile noodle soup.
