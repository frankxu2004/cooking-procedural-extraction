you 're watching cooking, recipes TV dot com.
shut brian here come on in let 's have some fun today.
we 're cooking a french classic beef.
bergen yawn also known as beef, and burgundy this classic recipe has been passed down for generations and generations.
now i 'm bringing it to your kitchen.
let 's get cooking.
we 're going to start off with two pounds of all natural hand.
cut stew beef.
i 'm going to sear, this with some fresh cracked, black pepper, as well as some kosher salt.
after i seared the beef and seasoned it, well, i 'm going to sanjay the beach.
now what that means.
is that is a french terminology, and it simply means to add a bit of flower to the beef, which will ultimately thicken up our stew as it cooks to that we 're going to add an entire bottle of red wine?
i want to add some organic beef broth now when i was in culinary school and working in the hotel 's one of the things.
i really love to do.
it sounds strange.
i 'm sure a lot of you.
but was to make a classic veal stock or beef stuck roasting of the bones, and the time in the preparation twelve to twenty four hours for a finished product, and i can tell you that there 's nothing like a good sauce or a good stew that 's made with a homemade stock.
it 's just not practical in a home kitchen.
i find if you use a good quality broth, you can get almost as close nothing around with these types of products and to that.
we 're going to add some sauteing pearl onions.
the classic dish combines mushrooms, which you certainly can add as well, as.
pearl , onions sous chef amanda not so big, on the mushroom.
so we skip them here.
finally , i want to talk to you a little bit about some of the other additions to the classic beef, bergen young and the classic beef bergin, jan oftentimes bacon is added the bacon is sauteed off.
and then the beef is then search browned.
if you would in the bacon fat, this gives the beef and excellent flavor, as well as helps with the carmelization and coloring of the beef.
however , we 're trying to cook healthy in two thousand eight or both working out and staying fit.
so , instead i sear the beef off in a canola vegetable oil is just a bit healthy for more healthy.
you , so something to think about let 's go ahead and let 's get cooking.
i 've gone ahead.
and i 've got all my be played out.
we can, and i 'm going to go ahead and now notice cracked pepper guys.
really makes a huge difference.
the stuff you reach up from in your jar, and it 's already, cracked it just does n't have that flavor of fresh cracked, black pepper.
so really is a lot tastier and then a little bit of kosher salt, you can season it pretty well, uh, it 'll soak it up pretty good.
so we 'll mix it up just a bit, so go ahead and move it around.
and then give it one more little bit of.
so in pepper, salt, salt and pepper and that looks pretty fantastic.
so our beef is well seasoned will move that over to the left and that starts optane.
so when were sauteing or searing we want to get the pan extremely hot.
i 'm going to pick up my fan here.
so i do n't smoke my house out.
and then i 'm gonna put a little oil in, and i think we can even let see how we are.
we 're getting there, but i 'm going to actually give it a couple.
more seconds to get searing hot and then we 're going to cook off the speed if a sous chef of mannequins getting shot at the beef again i 'm going to go ahead and put the V fox probably in about four batches.
the goal here is to really get a nice dark color on the bead, which is going to help color, are stew?
so , once the pieces started given a couple seconds before you move it around the idea is to keep your pan hot and sear each side.
so it 's been talking.
now about a few minutes or so, and i 'm going to move this deep around a little bit.
and then i 'm going to let it fits once again.
and this looks pretty good as you can see it 's getting a nice sear on it right now.
so what i want to do is after the beef is about half done.
and i 've got such a big can.
i got additional room.
so i 'm going to start some other beat over on this side, so the pan does n't get too hot.
and i could still maintain the temperature of my pan.
keep moving the beef around.
and as you can see we 're getting some nice color on that first batch.
i 'm not going to even think about the left when they just went in and just keeps, keeps on paying your beef until it gets very well, brown.
after the beef is fully brown, we 're going to have this panel with all these great, can jews?
so we 're going to place with some of that red wine.
i do n't need to pour all of it in the pan just enough to basically pick up those pan drippings and lose.
some , loosen them, then i 'll go ahead and get all those great into our crockpot.
we 're actually going to cook this, deprogramming on in the crockpot, which makes it really simple to worry about ovens and things like that.
it 's really getting the beep seared offer, so get ready with your red one already so.
let 's deglaze the pan.
it 's still steaming hot.
that 's OK, just as long as you get the wine in, there, right away, so what up can move that around.
like that, and let it reduce for a couple of seconds.
i can, from here, i can turn the heat off completely and will just add that to the beat.
once i 've gone ahead and saging the beef in the crockpot so our beef goes into our crock pot.
now before you start sauteing turn your crockpot on it and on a high.
setting and see all those drippings just give it a second, 'cause those are tasty and delicious move, that overlap.
so from here this is where we talked about sanjay so, i 'm just going to go ahead and, and first and in a couple tablespoons and then a couple more tablespoons, and discontinued to incorporate the flour while mixing it around this way your beef will get evenly coated with the flower, and you wo n't have a lumpy stew at the end of the day when your beef is ready.
but as you can see the flower is completely coated the beef that 's exactly what we want from here, go ahead and add the rest of the entire bottle of red wine and guys do n't skimp on this step you want a lot of red wine all right guys remember those pan drippings this is what i 'm talking about it 's metal.
so good that red wine.
so move your beef around with the red wine for several minutes until it starts to get hot, once you see it start to boil, then you can go ahead and stir a bit more an incorporate the beef broth sing a whole thirty two ounce container of beef broth these are the beef, bergen young, at the johnson household with mashed potatoes as well as oven roasted carrots and pearl onions you want to roast the carrots and onions in a preheated oven, four hundred degrees cost the vegetables in a light amount of olive oil with kosher salt, and pepper hey gang.
the beef stew is from cooking all day long is getting tender.
it 's very nice, now, it 's time to adjust the seasonings and that means tasting these things really important.
you need to know what you 're serving to your friends and family on a special night.
so grab a spoon and taste that is pretty good.
but it does need a bit more salt.
so i 'm just going to add a bit now, and i add very gradually in that continue to taste fresh cracked.
black pepper would be nice so the beef bergen young is really shaping up.
fantastic are pearl onions and carrots are roasting in the oven, we 've got some homemade mashed potatoes that will be serving with the beef.
soon , this is comfort food folks great in the winter time in a really simple.
so , so, then my friends is beef bergen yawn on amerikana style, stay saucy, and keep cooking.
