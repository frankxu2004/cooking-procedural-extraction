hawaii , i 'm kanok annual watching, ready steady eat today.
i 'm going to show you how to make hashbrowns, hashbrowns are staple breakfast food in america, basically it is a potato preparation which is pan fried it can be served as a side dish and it goes very well with any kind of meal.
so without any delay, let me tell you what all you need two to three raw potatoes, grated two to three tablespoons of all purpose flour that is made up.
beaten salt to taste half a teaspoon of black pepper powder.
soften butter for pan frying great.
the raw potatoes, and soak it at least for half an hour in water.
now drain the excess water, and pat dry all the potato and make sure that it does not have any moisture in it.
this will help in making our hash.
brown smoke recipe mix.
the egg in it.
and give it a whisk.
now at all purpose flour salt and black pepper powder.
now mix all the ingredients well, once you see that the potato is taken all the moisture at this point of time just keep the potato mixture in the fridge for at least half an hour.
so that it becomes warm enough to make into shapes.
once the mixture is out of the fridge heat, the pan take a small amount of the mixture in your palm and try to make a patty out of it.
now spread butter on the non stick, pan and place it over it.
now repeat the process for the rest of the mixture and keep it on a medium flame.
because we do n't want a potato to become brown, very fast.
because it is very wrong.
so it needs some time to be cooked from inside you can also do this recipe with powerball potatoes.
but i personally like to use the raw potatoes because it gives a very different texture.
if your little calorie conscious, just drizzle some olive oil on it.
now you can just check and see if you can flip it over it.
takes almost three to four minutes on each side.
here we have used raw potatoes, so, if you want you can cover it with a lid to ensure that it is cooked through just make sure that all the potatoes are cooked properly.
just flip it over and see, yeah, it 's done now.
it 's ready to solve.
now it 's ready to eat, you can serve it piping hot with red ketchup sauce, less a profit appetizer forty time i hope you like my recipe do try it and let me know how it turned out in the comment section below.
