hi , everybody, and welcome back to cooking share, we were in the supermarket the other day in the seafood.
i 'll and we came across a really good deal on some fresh squid and the kind of top wonder.
what we can do with this.
so we came back and put together fried calamary with the mayonnaise lemon dipping sauce which turned out to be a really delicious appetizer, so, let 's get started.
so what i 've got here is some squid that i 've cleaned by removing the tube in the membrane, and i 'm going to go ahead and slice it into rings.
also remember not to throw the tentacles because you can use them as well now.
i 'm going to begin making the coding by adding the flower to a container.
you can also use a zip lock bag if you lying followed by the salt.
i like a little bit of a zip to mind.
so i 'm going to go ahead and add some cayenne pepper that you do n't like this, you can simply leave it out some ground.
and i 'm just going to mix this up until everything is nicely combined.
then we 're going to add the squid in put, a lid on and give it a good shake.
until all the pieces are fully coated that 's what i 'm going to do is remove any excess flour by placing the squid into a sifter or kolander, and we 're going to set it aside on a plate now.
what i have here is some vegetable oil that i preheated.
so what we 're going to do is give it a test by dropping some flower in and if it sizzles and bubbles you 'll know.
it 's ready never going to place the kalibari in batches.
so i 'd save for about a couple of minutes after about two minutes, and the callum areas nicely golden brown, we 're going to remove it and, set it aside on a platter lined with a paper towel.
and we 're going to repeat this process for the remaining batches of calamari.
this is the sauce that i like to partner my kalamari with.
so i 'm going to begin by crushing some garlic into the mayonnaise, followed by some freshly squeezed lemon juice.
now i 'm just going to give this a mix until everything is nicely combined.
now , this seems simple, but believe me, it 's really good.
and there you have it are delicious kalamari with lemon mayonnaise, played it up with some lemon wedges on the side for more details.
