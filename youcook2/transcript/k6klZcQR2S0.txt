hide throwing farm your vegas morning, blend resident, chef and today, i 'm going to be making chinese spring rolls.
today 's ingredients are ground chicken wood ear mushrooms, which are also known as black fungus.
i have fresh taro, and carrots, sugar fish sauce, garlic green onions, salt and pepper of course.
the spring roll wrappers answer the cornstarch and water.
hi , today i 'm going to be making chinese spring rolls and now.
it 's different from vietnamese spring rolls, spring rolls in chinese in the chinese culture, typically means egg rolls at least that 's how i grew up knowing it is.
i 'm actually making my auntie, marys chick in spring rolls and these are amazing.
i love them now.
i 've got this spring roll wrappers.
and you 're going to get the ten inch ones.
and you 're actually going to cut them into force so it was a big sheet them into four.
so there 's smaller squares going to set that aside, now when you 're actually going to be starting this.
there 's something called wood ear mushrooms.
if you take a look at this kind of like an ear right, kind of trippy, it 's also known as black fungus.
now it comes dried just like this, and we 're going to do is wash it in cold water.
and then after we 're going to put hot boiling water on it, and you 're going to let it soak into reconstitute and one little mushroom like this will become one giant one like this.
so just follow the directions of the bag and set aside.
now if you 've never seen tarot, this is a big terror group and sometimes they have taro chips, which is really, really good.
if you get this nice and thin but this actually has like a brown skin on the outside, and i went ahead and cut it off and.
i just chopped it up and made into little cubes.
but this is great.
you can find this in the asian markets.
OK , all you have to do is stick all of this inside of a food processor.
this will save you a lot of time on shopping 'cause sometimes when you make egg rolls and stuff like that it actually takes a long time to chop everything up.
so we 're just going to put all this in.
i did about three quarters of a cup of tarot an one large.
carrot , which is almost the whole cup going to add that in and you 're going to add the woodier mushroom and i 'm doing about three or four whittier mushrooms, i mean, it 's a small piece at another one.
and i 'm going to be putting in two cloves of garlic smash that in now, i 'm going to go ahead and just puree it, oh, this smells.
and if you see like maybe like one or two pieces of large carrot, just take him out.
you can throw them out, so instead they decide to take this staff, if i can get it up there.
we go alright but this over here and i 've got my ground chicken already OK, go ahead and just add.
it right in.
and it 's nice to see how fast that when you use a little of food processor it 's so much quicker just get rid of that now this just makes it a lot easier now the ground chicken you can either grind it yourself.
you can have your butcher.
do it, or a lot of the chinese markets also have ground chick in that, in i have about one tablespoon in one teaspoon of fish sauce?
i also have one tablespoon in one teaspoon of sugar.
that kind of balances it out.
it 's true that around i 'm also going to add a little bit of salt and pepper to that.
so this is going to be about a teaspoon of salt, and probably like a quarter teaspoon of black pepper like using my hands for everything alright, going to get all mixed up.
now i 'm also going to add some green onions to it about four stocks going to mess it up.
really , small put, that, right in this is beautiful.
get all mixed up.
and if you see any large chunks like that just pull it right out.
so you 're going to get you 're going to get your little rapper and you 're going to make sure that it 's like a diamond like it 's facing.
you , like a diamond, so the corner so.
we 're going to do about probably less than a teaspoon of filling inside, you 're going to have like it 's going to stretch out.
so as you 're pushing it, you do n't want to be like that.
you want to be longer, so it will elongate itself.
and if you feel like you need a little more that 's fine put a little bit more now i made a corn starch like a little slurry nice and thick so it 's actually become a paste so i 'm just putting some on the edges and this is something that you 're going to be using your fingers a lot.
so , do n't, do n't be afraid of it and the cornstarch is really just going to help it be that kind of like a glue, OK.
and i love these to be tiny little cocktail, cocktail egg rolls.
and i 'm also putting some right on the corners on the edging, so when you fold it up, it 'll stick K.
I know the little edges are sticking out.
alright auntie mary.
i hope i made you proud.
now after you 've made about maybe six years.
seventy of those, i know it sounds like a lot.
but these are a labor of love.
i actually have a bunch already that i froze, and i made ahead of time and we 're just going to deep fry.
some OK get some of this out of the way.
so i have some frozen ones.
interesting to put him right in and again you 're going to have.
your , your oil.
at about three.
fifty , and remember that trick you 're going to use the tip of your chopstick going to stick in the oil and when it 's all bubbly, you know, it 's ready to go.
all right hall look at how fast, that is, already have some ready for you guys.
and i 'm serving it with little sweet chili dipping sauce.
these are delicious.
and these are going to be the hit of every single party that you throw with these delicious chinese spring rolls this is dory in.
fong , your las vegas morning blend resident chef with these delicious chinese chicken spring rolls.
