hi , everybody, and welcome back to cook and share today in this episode we 're making up a world famous dish that 's commonly found in thai eateries pat.
i we were traveling the other day and came across his mobile restaurant that was serving it.
we bought some and we thought for his this, ever good, so we thought we try and make it and share it with you.
i have to mention that there are many different ways of doing this.
and this is by no means authentic, so, if your tie do n't be offended start, and i have here some time noodles, i just picked these up at my local grocery store, you can also get them in any asian store.
so we 'll add these to a large container and pour a couple of cups of water over the top.
just enough to make sure the noodles are submerged and what you need to do is allow these to soak for about thirty minutes.
in the mean time what i 'm going to do is begin preparing the sauce and the main ingredients for it are fish sauce chili sauce sugar, and tamarind paste what i have here is some tamarind paste that i just picked up on my local asian store.
now this is really a fit concentrated pace.
so what i did, is added to a measuring cup, put in some water and must it down and mixed it up.
and of course, remove the seeds.
and if you want to know the exact measurements i did a write up on the blog.
so just check it out in making this dish is pretty important that you prepare everything in advance just.
so things go smoothly.
so what i have here is some shrimp that i 've deveined, indie shelled some extra firm tofu that i 've cubed up in pride, some eggs chopped shallots.
some garlic, some garlic chives, bean sprouts and some roasted peanuts.
OK , let 's make the sauce first by adding that amir into a preheated pan followed by the fish sauce chili sauce.
the sugar, usually palm sugar is used in this recipe, but if you 're on the other side of the world like me white sugar will do just fine.
so we 're just going to give the sister over medium heat.
bring it to a boil and set it aside.
that 's what we 're going to do is add some oil to a preheated pin.
add the shallots in followed by the chop garlic and ulster, and saute this just for a minute or two until their fragrant then will place the shrimp in followed by the bride tofu and give it a stir until the shrimp become pinkish now, we will add in the thai noodles that we soaked awhile ago some water.
and i 'm just going to toss this until they are thoroughly mixed.
now will push everything to one side of the pan, adding a little bit more oil just, so it 's not going to be dry, crack the egg in.
so remember one egg is for one serving.
i 'm just going to kind of break the yolk here.
scramble it up just a little bit.
and fold it into the noodles next what you 're going to do is for the sauce over and stuart around until the sauce coats the noodles.
now i should mention here that everything is done over medium high heat.
and of course, we want to make sure everything is well coated and the noodles of absorb the liquid lastly what we 're going to do is add in the bean sprouts and the garlic times and toss it for another minute or two until the noodles are saw dryden fairly tangled by the way, this is a serving for one.
but if you 're serving two or three or you 're a big eater simply double or triple the recipe.
now we 've played this up.
we 're going to garnish it with some roasted peanuts a few chives on the side.
some bean sprouts an lime wedges, and there you have it are delicious pat.
