hi , everybody, now we are going to see how to make soft apathy, then did insert weight floor.
two cups, salt, one pins.
i 'll one tablespoon and some hot water transfer weight float a big bass in no add salt and oil and hot water.
little by little to make it a softer dough, need the door will to make it very soft?
then only we can make softer parties.
the door is ready.
now cover it with a vegetable and keep it aside for ten minutes, ten minutes over.
now take small balls of this and all it tested with the weight floor and all it in round shape make it very thin, an use very little floor for dusting the door.
he depends for their older darn.
it wait for the small air bubbles.
now , you can see the air bubbles here.
turn over cook the other side for a longer time because we 're going to feed the first site on the wire net.
take it out.
we run the wireless and keep on high flame.
it 's ready now play some go over it.
instead , i love do the same process for the remaining dope, soft chapatis are ready to sell, try this and give us a feedback.
