welcome back to videojug, an their food for all series.
my name is pepper, author of the intolerant gourmet and in this episode, i 'm going to show you how to make gluten free dairy free egg.
free bait falafel, in lettuce bitter with maple tahini dressing first step of this recipe is all really simple.
we 're going to use a food processor and we 're just going to blitz it all together, and that takes any of the fat out of finely chopping the chick peas.
so we have attend a chick peas drained and rents replace those into the food processor.
next is too teaspoons of garlic oil.
i like to use garlic oaks, it 's got a subtler flavor than raw garlic clothes.
an as you 're just going to beat this from fresh, it makes a real difference.
and we 've got half a red onion, roughly chopped just throw it in there, and a little bit again of roughly chopped flat leaf parsley for a full list of ingredients just check the description box and.
next we 're going to add half a teaspoon of baking powder this just helps give the falafel a tiny little bit of which is what you want.
and then we 've got a mixture of herbs and spices or spices.
we 've got smoked.
paprika , which adds a lovely smoky flavor, we 've got cumin, and we 've got coriander.
anna pinch of sea salt, and finally, we add two teaspoons of your favorite source.
this can be chili jam.
or it could be tahini or it could be a hot source.
it 's whatever you favor.
it just adds a nice bit of depth and flavor.
it wo n't overpower the falafel, but it 's a nice addition and then we just posted it.
you want the check needs to become really finely chopped.
you might have to scrape down the sides set points just to make sure that everything is binding together.
you wanted to be a paste, but with a bit of text are so, of course, case would be a good description.
and as i said, well, just scrape down the size that 's just to make sure that you 've got any loose bits and pieces mixed in one last place.
you be able to smell already the spice mixture which will go really simple is great kind of autumn.
and , like moroccan persian flavor, so we get a mixing bowl and we 'll just wipe down the blade.
get that out the way.
take the falafel paste which is what it is at the moment and just scrape it in the.
next step is.
so incredibly easy, you just want to bind your falafel mixture.
so you 're adding a flower, but obviously we want gluten free flour and this is where gram flour comes in grand flowers chickpea flour.
you can use it to make soccer, which is a french bread.
you can also use it in pancake, mixtures, or baking, but of course, it 's perfect for falafel, becauses check these particular.
so we take her gram flour.
i 'd say for tablespoons, but it really depends on how much moisture is in your chick peas and how moist mixture is.
so , you want it to be bound together.
so we 'll start with three and then stir together and see what kind of texture is.
you just want it to still be slightly tacky but hold together nicely so that you can shape it into little patties and for this recipe.
we 're going to bake the falafel, which is n't your usual option.
normally we fry fluffle, and you could do with this mixture as well, but i prefer to do it in the oven, i think is got a nice flavor.
and , although looks a little less golden taste, just as delicious.
so that 's four tablespoons of gram flour, and then you 'll see that the mixture is holding together.
but still a paste.
and this is about right.
but we 're taking about a walnut size amount.
and we 're just going to.
you 'll see that it 's quite tacky.
that 's totally fine.
if you have a problem with it just all your hands with a little bit of olive oil and that will help them slide off and again.
we 're going to put them on an oiled baking tray to cook so to shape it into a little ball and then place it on your baking.
and you can flatten it slightly, but really you just want them to be like little mini patties.
and they wo n't spread when you bake them.
so you can put them quite place together.
so i 'm just going to carry on making these falafel until we 've used all the mixture up and put it on the baking tray, and then it 's into the oven at two hundred degrees for about twenty.
five to thirty minutes.
so a falafel are out of the oven, they 've been in there around thirty minutes, an i flip them over halfway through just.
so that they brown evenly, you 'll see that they brown top to bottom rather than round the edges.
but it 's all crisp.
because of their gram flour inside them.
so we 'll let those cool for a little bit.
and then we 're going to make our tahini maple dressing so in this bowl.
i 've got a really simple mixture of maple syrup, and he need into that we 're going to add the juice of half a lemon and depending on the size, or the juiciness of your lemons, you can add a little bit more.
a little bit less dressings or sources are.
so much to your own taste.
so trust your instinct if you like the way it tastes and the texture then go with that.
so stir the lemon juice in just until it 's combined and then we have about a tablespoon of garlic oil and again.
that adds, a really nice.
it 's intense garlic, but it does n't burn you like raw garlic.
would so it 's a good combination to have and just stir that through until it 's all emulsify died they?
there 's are tahini maple dressing made, you can see it 's really glossy and thick and perfect for going into the lettuce, bitter with the falafel, so, please.
two or three of the bait falafel into your lettuce cup, three for this, and if you have any chopped tomato or chopped avocado or extra fresh herbs you can add those at this point.
the more color, the better really grated beetroot all sorts, and then we spoon over a little bit of the tahini in maple dressing, which acts as a kind of source for your pitter and then you have by shea, you curve up the lettuce cups like this, and you have a ready made pitter for your falafel or for kabobs, or a burger.
perfect summertime food i 'm going to go and enjoy this, an hope to see you next time in their food for all series.
