hey , i 'm willie.
and i 'm john and were the hosts of grow cook eat, and if you were with us last season, you should know that we moved our garden from seattle, down to portland.
are we still have her chickens and will still be talking about how to grow food and cook in the kitchen?
so today we 're going to talk about box white, which looks like it would be hard to grow.
but it 's actually really easy in if i recall, is not that hard to cook?
no , it cooks up super fast.
and we 're going to show you how to make boudin soup with bok, choy.
it only takes about fifteen minutes.
i 'm going to plant some bok, choy by seed, you can also grow them by starts but seeds are less expensive.
and it grows really well and quickly from seed when you 're working with small seeds.
not only do you want to have soil that 's finally worked.
but you also want to make sure that you 're not going to cover him up too much with soil.
then , i 'm going to take a pinch of the seed and just try.
so it, in a row, spacing the seeds as evenly as i can, you know, aiming for about an inch, apart.
it 's a good idea with really small seed and this works well, with basil seed carrot seed.
and you see that small water it.
and , with a stream from a watering can not from your hose, hoses have two strong of a stream of water and they 'll wash your seeds away.
now you can cover them up with garden soil.
but i like to use some potting soil because it 's lightweight.
i know that it 's weed free and it 's a slightly different color from my garden soil.
so it makes it easy for me to remember where i 've sown seed then i go through and tap the soil with my hand and that 's just.
so there 's good soil seed contact, which is important for germination and then you go back over with the water one more time just to make sure that it 's all watered, in.
so i have some pok, choy that i grew from starts, growing underneath what 's called a hoop house and hoop house is basically a really simple greenhouse.
so underneath here i have some broccoli, growing some radishes.
and then these purple, purple box way, you just want to take a sharp knife and slide it just under the soil line and several the plant from its roots.
i 've got the hoop house.
all covered back up so i 'm going to head inside and make dinner making an soup a lot during the week 'cause it 's really fast and easy.
so i 've got four cups of broth here.
and you can use chicken broth or vegetable broth, and i 'm just going to bring it up to a boil and once they bring it up to a boil.
all add in the noodles, and you can just get boudin noodles at the grocery store, they sell 'em frozen or there in the refrigerator case, too two tablespoons of olive oil in the pan and i 've heated it up over medium high heat an i 'm going to put two, chopped garlic cloves into the olive oil and just give him a little stir and let him saute until they are fragrant and then i 'm going to add in the peppers.
so i got the greens they have still a little bit of water clean to their leaves, and that 's nice it just helps them well, it 's a little bit and just give the green booster.
so that their coated with olive oil once the greens have wilted down to your desired consistency, you can just turn off the heat and said on the side and tell the rest of the soups ready i 'm just going to divide the greens between the two bowls i 'm going to put the noodles between the bulls too so, i 'm just going to skip out about half the noodles and some ross came ready to eat i will moment of truth when you think no, no holds barred feedback yes, it 's a little faster than i thought i 'd be those firms are kinda hot spicy both delicious that sounds a little safer than i thought maybe just give me a minute OK we 've got a facebook page.
now and so.
