today , i 'm going to show you one of the ways that i make shepherds pie.
so little bit of all not too much got a nice hot pan there.
now what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to put about five hundred grams half a kilo of men to me.
so it 's going to be land this one.
so such an alignment in here no, just had a little bit of salt and pepper to this, obviously do that for taste, and.
now what you want to do is really just earnest.
try and break up there alignment.
and it can get it grounds so you really only want to cook this for about two or three minutes on a fairly high heat.
it 's going to turn over there.
i 've been cooking it for just about just over two minutes now.
and what we can do is just if you need to thicken up a little bit, just a little bit of flowering there.
so little, spoonful of that.
it just makes that all around.
and it would just help starting to thicken up so you got a nice thick source.
the next stage put young you name.
because it 's been grated, obviously it 's not gonna take that long to cook, and we 've got the garlic in which is sort of mix it around again.
do the same with a carrot?
she got her good selection of things here.
i mean, obviously you can add things to taste.
i mean, you can have some peas in whatever you like.
so we get a hold in there that stuff for those stirred up and cooking for him.
nearly a minute just put a bit of seattle wash the source lee parents or wish this also put a good splash, it out in and also one bit of tomato puri.
so again we just put a splodger that give it a quick stir, i mean, you can always add it to taste that might just put a little bit more puri in there.
i see another quick score that and the other better red wine.
do n't go overboard and give that a good store up now?
i 'm also at this stage going to add a bit of rosemary and some time.
i 've already got it sort of chopped up there quite fine, so just going to sprinkle that on, is it a nice flavor?
we do n't need to cook this very long probably at the stage where really we can add a little bit of chicken stock just trying to make sure the red wines mix in, and there 's no liquid sort of their of red wine.
just get it all, of it and see it 's looking really good color.
though i 'm just going to add a little bit of chick in stock, i mean, you can use lamb stock if you want.
but i 'm just going to use a bit of chicken stock.
i think it gives it a nice flavor.
just going to start that really on a low, low, he.
i would say.
now for about a minute, and just try and get out to thicken up nicely.
now we gotta, start doing the mashed potato.
so that 's going to be no.
so i just leave that cooking errand for about a minute, and we 're probably ready to go for.
i had them mashed potato into the pan things you want to try the base first and see what it 's like mines.
good got all those.
the rosemary salt coming through.
i could add had just that adds.
more salt, salt and pepper to my one and a tiny little bit chicken stock.
extra , and we never see the source in that you can have it as you like.
if you like it slightly thicker, then do it as i 've done it.
if you like it a little bit more running like a grave, you just add a little bit more chikin stop.
so that 's ready to go now.
so we 're going to put it into a little ceramic part and then we 're going to put the mashed potato on top.
you got me potatoes done.
so of white potatoes.
actually , any potato, though.
so we 're just going to make them appetite, i 'm just cutting it up.
so that then i can sort of play some butter in there, try and make it.
so really it sticks on the spoon when you lift the app.
so it 's all matched up.
you put your spoon in there, and it 's of hangs, hangs there really, that 's how you want it, you do n't want it to run any otherwise.
it will just disappear into the mints and stuff.
so i 'm going to use the matching thing for that, and just match that up.
now i 've got mashed potato ready, and you can see that it pretty much hangs on the spoon there if you give it like.
so that 's nice the mashed potato really.
so that 's good.
now the other little ingredient which is up to you whether you add or not.
but i mean i, i really like it on there is a bit of parmesan cheese, grated parmesan cheese.
so you can mix that in with the mash.
so we just give it a quick start and the other thing again to add to this.
really is a little bit more.
so can do that to taste, and a little bit of pepper and then it 's really were ready to put the two together so are now.
show you just put in the two together.
and we 're going to put it in the oven, and it 's ready to cook just pop the mint in here.
then we 're going to leveled out a little bit and then simply just put the mashed potato over the top for do it just going to sneak a few peas in it just give up their color and how many kids like the peas and stuff.
so i can get away with that.
so just put the mashed potato on drawing spread, it over.
so seals itself at really you get it right out to the edges and push it down.
so it 's nicely on top got all the matter, sorted out.
it sealed up around the edges, so that 's nice.
now what i 've got here is a little bit of grated cheese.
this is just normal, mature sort of cheddar so you can just sprinkle some of that on top of there user fault just to kind of rough.
this up a little bit.
and it gets some of the cheese in there as well, because all these little fluffy bitch, you create the bits that go brown and give it the effect.
so , like that, and again little bit more cheese just bubble on top.
and we 're going to put this in the oven for about twenty minutes, i 'd say around about two twenty two forty degrees.
so it looks brown.
what you gotta, remember it 's all cooked, we just now browning off the top and making it look nice.
the last thing just to do is just to get with the fault there, and i think it just let some of the steam out.
so it does n't overflow.
so pop that like so ready to go any album.
so i 'm just going to pull this out.
now i 've actually left it a little bit longer.
so it 's been there about twenty, two twenty three minutes, and you can see that you 've got an eyesore, browned off top.
let 's have a look at it.
i 'll put it on the table windows.
server piece up.
let 's have a look at what 's inside OK.
i got the shepherds pie.
there , i 'm just going to make a little cut with a knife there to start with, and then i 'm going to do is just use a spoon here.
big spoon serve this up.
i mean, this is if you can see that, but this is lovely and moist, and you 've got a nice sort of crispy coating on the top.
there , there what we can do is service at with a little bit of extra gravy if you want an maybe a few peas which is what i think i 'll do OK, i 'm just going to put a few peas just alongside there, like.
so and maybe a little bit of gravy just to finish off and then as well, as always do the taste test.
i love the rosemary in it.
you can take the time.
is it 's a really nice dish?
