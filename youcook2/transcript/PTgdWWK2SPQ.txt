it 's cooking with cuisinart, great recipes from master chefs, now.
now today 's recipe plus that if julie it 's a great hearty soup in italy and what it means fagioli, uh, those little white beans right over here or the kennel, oney beans cigarette soup, the problem, with it, it takes about two to two and half hours to cook this blue, eyed beans until they 're really tender and when i 'm using today is a great pressure cooker over here and what that pressure cooker does.
it cooks the beans in about thirty five minutes.
let me show you how to do it, so, first i have some celery right over here.
and i will slice that celery just like that.
OK , once i have the salary going.
i will remove now the salary from the working bowl K.
let me transfer that right in here.
OK , once i have that, so now the next ingredients are we pudding the blade into the ball and will transfer three garlic cloves in there.
and will chop them.
and you really find perfect, so once i have that so now the next step i 'm adding some onions to it.
so that 's about two medium onions or wanna have larger ones that have courted up already and the other element is occured.
so just going to cut the carrot kind.
of course silly before adding into the food processor.
and i have that.
let me put that in, and just couple on enough i 'm shopping now the onions and the kurds.
and i will transfer all those vegetables in the pressure cooker.
no , i 'm taking the lid off and the pressure cooker actually also works like assertive pan or like a brazier.
i turned out the heat and what i will do.
now i will see all the vegetables in a pressure cooker just by adding a little bit of olive oil.
anne , with transfer.
now all the vegetables that onions, garlic and the carrots into the oil.
so now i 'm also adding the sliced celery into my vegetable mix and some italian spice mix and.
now i 'm just going to keep on steering that very gently.
enter my onions become really nice entrance lucid, and it 's amazing just by adding actually that italian spice mix just to the heat.
i can really smell it right there already.
so it 's quite amazing.
we have not even started cooking and it smells already, you want to pull.
my vegetables are really nice and already and steaming.
so the next step now i 'm having my kennel, oney beans.
i 'm adding one pound of beans, right over it.
and i have six cups of water right over, OK, so once i have that one more item bay.
leave right into it.
so now let me close it, and let me set the high pressure.
i just said the pressure cooker on thirty five minutes on high pressure and believe it or not, just thirty five minutes, and was being is going to be better tender alright.
now , you see this team actually building up.
that means the pressure keeps on building up inside, and as soon as steam stops the countdown, starts thirty five minutes.
and we are ready with some great beans.
so i cook, the beans for thirty five minutes, anna naturally release the pressure from it for about twenty minutes.
i 'm ready now to open up the lid.
can you see how it is, and you can see how my current san, my beans, already nice and tender right there?
and i was basically achieved just in thirty five minutes.
so now the next step i 'm running some more chicken stock to it.
OK , and i have some diced tomatoes.
i 'm adding to it.
OK , so now we have that and let me set it up to browning.
so what i 'm trying to achieve now here is actually bringing everything to a boil.
and at the last.
moment , i 'm adding the pasta.
so just going to drizzle the pasta nicely into it and i 'm going to bring it back to a simmer and will cook the pasta for about ten to twelve minutes and soup is absolutely ready.
i guess the soup is ready as you can see an easy words to cook those beans.
so now come time for plating K.
so we can see how nice.
and you can even see it how tender does beans are.
and how easy, it was to cook him just for about thirty five minutes cause i want to get some of that broth and by the beans, cooking that way.
it really thickens up the broth of, you see, you can see.
so that and.
now the way i really like to server is with some parmesan cheese that i 'm sprinkling just over.
and they can be pretty generous with the promise on cheese, you can even serve a little bit of the cheese on the side, sprinkling a little bit of costly over it.
here goes the pasta.
eight fagioli, the great, great soup.
and it 's very simple to do.
but also remember by using the pressure cooker, you can even use it on a party and serving the part just like that.
keep it the set on simmer and doing the whole party, your friends and everyone can just help themselves leading up the soup, and correct way without a pressure cooker.
you will never be able to cook the beans in thirty five minutes.
