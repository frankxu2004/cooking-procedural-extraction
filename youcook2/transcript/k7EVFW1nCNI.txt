hi , i 'm dying cometa, antidaeon, dishing with die.
i 'm making caesar salad.
this is a classic salad, and the dressing caesar dressing is really easy, and it can be used for lots of other things.
so let me show you what you need, and we 'll get started today on dish and with i he needs some mayonnaise.
some freshly grated parmesan cheese.
some lemon juice, some worcestershire sauce, some olive oil dijon mustard, granulated sugar, chopped garlic anchovy paste fresh ground black pepper and salt.
i also have some romain lettuce here that i 've washed.
and thoroughly pat it dry.
and then chopped into bite size.
pieces now, it 's important that you keep your romaine lettuce chilled before you serve it.
because if it sits out at room temperature, too long after it 's been caught then it can wilt a little bit.
so i 'm going to set that aside and make sure i get that back into the fridge.
the other thing that i have are my fresh homemade croutons, so you can, you know, store bought if you want, but these are really simple to make.
so i 'm going to leave the link for this for you as well.
now this is a really super simple recipe.
it 's just a lot of different ingredients here.
now i have a little mini food processor that i 'm going to use for this.
if you do n't have one, you can use a blender.
you can use an immersion blender or you could try to do this by hand, and i 'll explain different things that you might have to adjust, if you do it by hand now.
the one thing you might notice so eggs in this, which makes it really nice.
so , if you have a problem with fresh eggs in your area, you do n't have to worry about it with this recipe.
now , the first thing that i 'm going to do is put my meanings into my little food processor.
really we 're going to put everything in, here.
so as i put the things in all explain stuff to you and you could use either regular low fat, fat free mayonnaise, whatever you prefer just use a good mayonnaise OK.
now the parmesan cheese.
now i have fresh grated parmesan cheese here.
and i actually grade it in my little mini food processor, which makes it really easy, because it 's less expensive.
if you can buy it in the big chunk like that.
but if you want to buy it already graded that 's up to you.
but again make sure you get a really good brand.
now next i have some fresh lemon juice this is freshly squeezed if you do n't have fresh lemons.
you can buy the bottled stuff in the store.
no problem with that a little bit, which you share sauce, all of the measurements are on my website, dishing with die dot com.
so , do n't worry about that?
and that 's where you find all my other recipes to now.
this is a little bit of olive oil.
just a little and again good brands, good brands of everything whatever the best is that you can afford is going to make this taste, and it would you did n't buy good brands, and this is dijon mustard.
i just have a little bit here a little bit of sugar.
this is granulated sugar and the garlic now.
this is chopped.
now if you do n't have a food processor or blender or any of the other things i mentioned, then you might want to just take this and grate the garlic into the bowl that you 're going to be mixing everything in.
because you do n't want chunks of garlic, like this in the salad, it has to be very finely blended.
so i 'm going to put this in here, and it will get blended up well in here now.
next is the anchovy paste now.
i just want to show you that this is, this is the brand that i picked up at the store.
and , this is usually found on the shelf.
it 's not refrigerated after you open it, you have to refrigerate it, but it 's in a little tube like this.
now you could use fresh anchovies if you want to.
you just have to chop those up, nice and fine.
i do n't use anchovies all the time.
i used it in my shrimp bisque, but i do n't really prefer to have fresh anchovies.
this works a lot better for me.
so would leave this out completely if you want to.
but it really is what kind of, gives caesar salad that nice taste do not really aware of what it is.
that 's making it taste.
so , great aunt, ruby 's.
so you could just kind of adjust how much you want in there.
but again if you do n't want it just nicks it so, i 'm gonna put this in the fresh ground.
and i 'm going to put a little bit of salt in there not, not too much on the salt.
because if you 're using the anchovy paste that 's already a little bit salty.
now we 're just going to take this and blend it up.
alright that was quick and easy.
now you can see the little flicks of pepper in there.
and you could see it looks like there 's little lumps in it.
that 's actually the cheese, so this is what you usually see when you have caesar salad dressing or caesar, dressing.
we should call it and what i usually do is make it a day or two ahead of time.
it actually tastes better if it at least sits overnight and it 's one of those things after a couple days.
it just keeps getting better and better really keep it for about a week in an airtight container.
but i 'm just going to put a little bit of dressing on here.
toss , a few of those in they 're so crunchy.
just get everything well, coded.
and now i 'm just going to put this into my serving bowl.
just a little bit and that looks gorgeous.
i like a lot of dressing on there, put some of those croutons on and what i like to do is let me put like a couple extra ones on there that do n't have anything on it.
and you could also put some more fresh ground.
black pepper on here if you want an, i think it looks nice when you put like a few greats of the fresh parmesan like shredded like this over top does not look, nice, that was.
and now i gotta give a little taste croutons.
oh , oh, crunchy really delicious lots of labor.
it does get better, as it sits.
it tastes great right.
now , but i would really recommend that you make this in advance.
the recipe is on my website diswood.
I dot com.
i hope i made your light a little easier more enjoyable and delicious.
but see you next time, bye, bye.
