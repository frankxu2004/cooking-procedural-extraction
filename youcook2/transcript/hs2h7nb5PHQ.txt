today is the day i 'm finally.
it 's different than most it 's pretty basic.
there 's no bacon or corn.
this soup is so easy and so yummy.
i know you 're going to fall in love with it.
so , stick around and i 'll show you how to make it OK the ingredients.
you will need are four cups diced potatoes, two cups chopped celery.
two cups chopped onions and four cans of clams.
and i usually use two minutes and two chop just to get a variety clams.
you 're going to need two pots to make this soup and the first part you 're going to add your all your veggies in.
and you 're going to open up your cans of clams in poor in their juice, you can get a little strainer to get more juice out.
but i could n't find my little strainer on this day.
so i 'm doing it old school, pour all the juice in there.
and you might think at first that, that 's an odd enough juice from the four cans.
but i promise you it will be once your vegetable start cooking.
they 'll let off their juices.
and you 'll have plenty.
so you can use frozen potatoes.
and it works really good in this chowder, but not at this point, and i 'll show you later.
when you can add the frozen potatoes in and you 're going to let these simmer until the potatoes are tender now.
let 's grab our second pot to make the chowder.
you will need a half cup of butter.
and i usually chop it up to put it in the pot just so in a melt faster.
and then you will need a quart of half and, half and then four cups of milk, you can use whole milk.
but we have skim in our house, is kim works fine?
this soup still thickens up really well.
oh , do n't worry about that, and then you 'll need a cup of cornstarch.
no , i added in when all my milk is still very cold.
that way i do n't get lumps from the quote cornstarch.
OK , you will need three teaspoons of salt and black pepper.
i just dust the top of it.
i do n't measure it at all.
and then you 'll need one teaspoon of sugar.
and then you 're going to wish that up again.
we 're going to keep whisking until thickens up and you 're not going to want to ignore the stove too much.
because you will scorch the bottom of your pan, i used to do that a lot when i first started cooking this when i was in college.
you do n't have to consistently stir books.
turret quite often, and it 'll thicken up on you.
when 's your veggies are done.
you 're gonna add them to your cream mixture, and this is when you can add your frozen potatoes in it.
will just take a little bit longer to heat through and then you 're going to add your clams.
so that does n't take long for the clams, took you just are heating him through basically.
so in if you do use frozen potatoes, you might want to use your whole milk instead of the skim milk to help thicken it.
but it works really good?
i 've done it.
and then i just taste test it, with a plastic fork, 'cause for some reason and metal fork this makes the chatter seemed saltier to me.
i do n't know.
so , yeah, an it 's done, you 're basically just warming, your clams, annuar chatter is done it 's super fast.
you guys, and then we 'll displayed up and chow down.
and i promise you, you will absolutely love this chowder is addicting.
and makes you really full.
one , this batch is just a one batch, and it feeds our family.
but if we are going to have company we usually double it and it makes a lot of soup.
but serve it up with your favorite rolls, and you will be a happy camper.
seriously it was like one of the first meals.
i ever learned to cook for my mom.
and so in college i used to make chicken fingers rahman and clam.
chatter , those are real tears.
hilarious , i love i cried, oh, goodness, i can spell those onions from here.
my mom would make it for us did you buy, beer.
no there 's lots of listening going on, on your face.
this chapter is so good.
i do n't make you cry.
do n't move my eyes are burning fire?
