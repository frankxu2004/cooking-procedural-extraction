so special, i mean, where else in the world, can you find a hotel that has a salad that we 've been serving for almost a hundred years, you know, it has to have something special button to stood the test of time.
still , be as popular today as it was a hundred years ago originally invented in the late eighteen eighties by hotel mater dei oscar turkey.
this dish and others were inspired by his desire to go above and beyond to please guests to this day.
cherkis legacy plays a role in the hotel from a namesake browser E oscars to the widely known waldorf salad every year since the hotel has served roughly ten thousand of these salads yes, from the pope to president obama, where in the kitchen of the historic waldorf, astoria hotel with executive chef david garcelon how does your version today stack up to the first version that was ever created biggest change probably from the original is that we do n't use mayonnaise anymore we prefer to use yogurt and a little bit of crown fresh to make it lighter.
in a little bit more healthy little bit more modern.
so the first thing we 're going to do is the candy walnuts, you can do these ahead of time.
so we, you need walnuts egg white spice mix of some kind to give it some flavor.
we 're going to start with our walnut halves.
and we 're going to coat those with a little bit of egg way.
could you use pecans?
instead , if you did n't have walnuts, pecans, pecans are great.
very good candy pecans are more sweets, a bit of a richer flavor.
i would say with pecans, so you do n't need a lot of egg white.
it 's really just there to make the sugar spice mixture stick to the walnuts were going to sugar add a little bit of spice.
mixture this one, is paprika, cayenne fennel seeds a little bit of coriander.
how spicy do you like to make it generally, you know, i would n't without like this.
it 's a really light refreshing, so i would make it too spicy and will spread those out on baking sheet, lined with parchment paper and again.
you want to make sure it 's one even layer correct.
yeah , you do n't want them stuck too much.
together it 's not the end of the world.
there will just have to break them apart of it.
so we 're going to roast this in a vented about three hundred fifty degrees.
you really want to keep an eye on it.
melt the walnuts continue to cook, even after you 've taken them out of the oven.
so be sure not to leave them in the oven for too long while the walnuts are cooking.
let 's get started.
on the dressing david, what do we need, need some yogurt a little bit of cram fresh some lemon juice white pepper walnut oil and black truffle will start with a little bit of crim fresh can use?
sour cream is a great substitute in the same.
amount , or you could use just yogurt with a little bit of mayonnaise would work, well, also.
so a lot of it at our yogurt just.
let 's get together to combine it, and i 'm just going to why you doing that i 'm just gonna squeeze in a little bit of lemon juice, a little bit of white pepper.
could you use black pepper instead?
absolutely could, yeah, so you 're adding truffles chef what does that bring to the dish.
i will swallow for story after also it 's a very elegant rare expensive ingredients.
so that 's why we like to add it.
but it also brings a very earth and aromatic flavor to the dish that 's very unique solve black truffle in the entire building.
so the last thing we want to add a little bit of walland or when we had this, you want to whisk it fairly, fairly quickly.
so i 'll pour that in if you 're anything like me, you may not have walnut oil at home chef is there any other oil that we could use would workout like another nap, based oil truffle like a white truffle.
oil would work, well, if you do n't have any of those, just leave it out.
and it will still be a beautiful salad, so now will need to put the salad together chef.
how do we begin with that, so the ingredients we still need to add or celery roots?
granny smith apples gala apples, red grapes and micro greens.
so we want to julie and the celery root as well as the two types of apples we 'd like to try the apple.
sure , let 's go for it.
watch your fingers, chef what would you recommend if you do n't have a mandolin at home, you can use a sharp knife.
the most important thing is to get long thin slices.
so we 've moved the apples into the mixing bowl.
let 's put the walnuts out of the oven, so the nice and golden brown, you do n't really want to keep it on the color.
you do n't want to get too much darker than this, otherwise as you say bill overcook.
now we 're going to put the dressing into the apples and celery is there a method to the madness.
here you wanna make sure you do n't put too much in our otherwise.
you have to julian more apples and celery.
it 's important to coat the ingredients so to keep it from oxidizing.
you do n't want them to turn brown.
that 's what the lemon juice will do.
so , the dressing actually helps prevent the apples from oxidizing.
how necessary is that rain mold so not really necessary at all.
but they say we with our eyes first.
so it 's all about height, presentation and color.
that 's why we used the remote.
it 's like the leaning tower of apple.
so we 'll just garnish the plate with some red grapes, alberta color somewhere walnuts.
and then these are microgreens could use the leaves, the leaves from the salary as well.
really it 's just for, just for color in it a little bit more height that 's beautiful and there you have it a waldorf salad from the waldorf, astoria.
well , chef all this talk is making me really hungry.
it looks delicious.
and i ca n't wait to try it.
i love the nuttiness of the walnut, which are just sweet enough combined with the crisp apple texture.
it seems like something would be heavy, but it is very light and refreshing.
it 's great, great.
