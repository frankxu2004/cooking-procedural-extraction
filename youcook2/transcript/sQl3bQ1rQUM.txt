any hive, japan and making tempura shrimp last couple video.
i use a tempura batter and some people told me that they cannot get that ingredient.
so i 'm going to show you how to make it from scratch.
so , first i have this ocean garden shrimp.
very fresh wishaw does the.
twenty , one count, which is pretty good sized.
so we 're going to kill the show off first and what i 'd like to do is i want to save the tail.
the reason is easy for you to grab to dip in, and friday.
after you pay the show right, and there 's a vein in the back here, you just use the two pick or anything just kind of like a scoop it out, like that pretty simple thing to do see here N out.
some sort like a paper tower.
next you see, the shrimp here, we want to keep them latter limit cut here, just halfway like that, the reason is.
because once the shrimp cook they tend to want to curve in right.
so if we cut here and then you turn around and get them a quick push gently push.
because the shrimp meet a very tender like this sit outside.
can you move to work on your next one?
this one who site.
so , watch me, jakar halfway do n't cut through.
put down and keep them a quick push that now this trim is done cutting.
i 'm going to add a pinch of salt and black pepper.
here i have one cup of all purpose flour.
half cup of cornstarch, and then we 're going to use ice water to mix it in they give them when you fry the temperature will get them a nice crispy call batter.
an hot oil.
the reaction give you super crispy, and here i got a little bit of some flower or purpose power.
we 're going to use the shrimp to dividend and with the batter and fried so now.
let 's see, i 'm going to crack my tape and then we 're going to get them a quick stir, a picture salt.
my pepper option, let 's see how much water.
do we need usually i go by the texture only got a couple ice cubes inside no big deal?
we 're going to use two have captain, first get them a quick mix.
so i had about one in a half cup of ice water, three two four cube of ice.
end , well, evenly, if you have a little long this OK but can brush rims, OK, i will say the texture like pancake texture.
here 's a vegetable cooking, oil three hundred forty degrees very hot, so we 're going to bear some make some better.
first , at that tripping, see how i do it.
and then quickly.
yet washroom show sound flower and the batter and then put a right here on the top.
try to connect with all those little prompt and then at the crime tour to their shrimp like that we 're going to SM better in first and in tibet and just go around.
so we 're going to make a lot of battery first.
you see that, and then you did with your shrimp in just like that floating on the top of those better right, and then we just going to slowly mix that better in together, with a string like this.
so they will target together.
OK , simple as that see that do n't think about couple minutes to fried.
now we 're just going to let them cry until like crispy, hickory quick as i said, two minutes.
the most and then i have a paper towel.
the trailer just set it up.
it 's temporal crump at the sushi restaurant, they charge you right.
i save a huge ball saver for super bowl.
