hi , i 'm jeremy soul from island creek oyster bar today.
we 're going to talk about one of my favorite fish caught there 's two kinds of card that are generally available.
one specific card, which has a similar appearance to atlantic cod pacific card is caught mostly in alaska, just wanted the largest commercial catches available in alaska atlantic cod, is identified with new england and ranges from greenland down in north carolina, they look similar, and that 's how the pacific cod got his name card.
because of similar in appearance.
but they are not the same fish.
atlantic cod is a little more prized.
has a beautiful silky texture, a larger flake, specific card is a little firmer texture in a little different color?
if you 're buying real card, you want to make sure that you 're buying card from the northeast.
then , we 're going to fish and chips with atlantic cod.
first thing we do is we 're going to take our card.
that we already have cut, and we 're going to put that in buttermilk going to add a little bit, it 's baskota the buttermilk.
but wo n't make it spicy.
but it has a nice.
we sat around and then just go ahead and set your card right in the buttermilk going to let that.
so for about an hour.
so our continent soaking for about an hour.
we 're going to get our flower writing by seizing it up, we had a little bit of cayenne africa and dry mustard.
stir that in i 'm going to dredge are card right in the flower and put in a fryer, wanna, make sure it 's coded all over.
but then we 're going to shake off any excess right in the fryer, our cousin frog for a few minutes, i think it 's ready, yeah, looks great, nice and golden brown.
you want to give a few minutes to get nice and crispy going to move it to a paper towel.
let 's from the oil drain off you 're going to see some little salt and pepper go right on top of our crispy fries.
going to garnish little bit of lemon wedge.
and there we have it atlantic cod fish and chips.
