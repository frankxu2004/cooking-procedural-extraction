probably this hundred year old recipe of crispy fried chicken, so, let 's go ahead and learn how to make this chicken.
here is the chicken which i cut into pieces.
but this chicken has to be put in salt.
that means just mix some salt in the water site and put in the refrigerator overnight.
that 's when the chicken will become nice.
and tender after that we 're going to make it better to make this now.
i 'm going to show you a very simple batter, using some type of order solved one cup of all purpose flour, you know, measure it and do it for this recipe.
and then makes this nicely with the paper border.
now in this bigger dad, just beaten two eggs.
put it in this and half cup of soda, OK.
if you want you can also use beer, but if you do n't want to use beer add half a cup of soda and makes this better.
slowly , this will form a lot.
but that 's OK, this will become kind of a thick batter.
fantastic just make sure that there are no lumps laugh, look at this better perfect, is n't it?
now they 're going to dip in chicken here.
take these chicken pieces, you know, with the help of paper towel or cloth.
just pat them dry.
you do n't want any moisture on this, dip it in this better, look at this, this is going to be really thick, better look at this chicken.
this is nicely coated with all these better, but you got to keep this in the refrigerator for at least one hour before frying so.
let me put in the refrigerator and flight after one hour.
after pudding in the refrigerator from one hour just dropping these pieces of chicken love, you know, they get nicely marinated also, i suppose and then we 're going to fly this love the better.
but this is a special better.
