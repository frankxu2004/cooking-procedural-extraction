i ready chef book here and today we 're cooking up a decadent, delectable awesome spaghetti.
if you never tried carbon, are, you know, definitely.
give this ago.
it 's luscious, you 're going to love it.
get a little pecorino, romano rate that up, you know, we 're going to use about a half a cup.
i 'm actually going to use a little bit more than that.
then i 'm going to use three egg yolks just the yolks three and then one entire egg you want to whip those eggs up together and go ahead and add your cheese into there.
now he goes about a half a cup of cheese.
but really, i 'm using about three quarters of a cup 'cause i 'm going to choose, you know, this mixture is going to be really kind of thick and look how yellow that is, you know.
but that 's the way it 's going to look.
because we use a mostly yolks.
but that 's really what 's going to make this dish.
so delicious, and creamy you some pancetta, if you got it.
but i 'm going to try some thick sliced bacon i got a local farm around here, and this bacon 's already pepper E, and, you know, peppers a big part of this dish, and it 's making a stick.
so i 'm going to go ahead and cut it up and use this.
here , if using pancetta, whatever use you want it to be nice and thick and cubed picture spaghetti up.
according to the package directions, and just put a little bit of salt in there.
so you do n't need a lot of extra salt in this dish get your skillet heated up.
and we 'll go ahead and start working on this bacon and getting that cooked up, and if you wanted to you could put a little bit of onion and garlic in here too.
but we 're making kind of a classic semi classic carbon are.
so we 're going to leave that out today.
but what you do want to put in is pepper.
but i 'm still throwing some more pep on here so, you know, carbonize all about the pepper.
now we want to cook our bacon all up.
we want to cook it through.
but we do n't want it to be crispy.
you know, definitely do n't want it to be crispy.
but you 're going to want to pull off some of that bacon grease there at the end when you 're just about ready to finish 'cause you 're not going to want all that grease there.
you do n't have to be militant about getting out of the pan.
a little bit of that is going to be great flavor, but strain that.
and then your posture should be ready and then we 'll just go ahead and dip out pasta out of this pain and throw it skillet there.
now do n't drain orange hair pasta or anything.
just throw it right in there, swishing around get it mixed in with this meat.
get all these flavors, all throughout this pasta, you know, when you want to do that before you put your sauce in there 'cause you want to put your sauce on top of this pasta, and meat do n't throw your sauce into the skillet with the bacon 'cause you do n't want scrambled eggs.
man you want sauce, you want a nice creamy egg sauce, so go ahead and pull that on top, you know.
get it all in there.
through you know, we 're going to swish it in swirl at all around, and it 's going to produce this wonderful creamy delicious egg sauce, and if you 've never had it you gotta try this is such a awesome flavor.
it 's going to be so creamy, but we 're not putting any cream in it.
and if you wanted to you could put a little bit of fresh parsley in here for a little bit of color that 's up to you.
but , man, look at this.
it 's just fantastic and then that 's it.
