hi , my name is terry and you 're watching sushi by terry is anything i can start.
you guys, all with.
let me guess california roll yup, california rolled and spice email, you, you still eat california rolls, i eat real sushi, can i get a spicy tuna, please.
but i like california rolls sounds good.
i 'll put that in for you, ladies, but i like california rolls real sushi today.
i 'm going to show you how to make spicy tuna rolls spicy.
another spicy tuna roll is a little bit different than the california roll.
it 's rolled in a style called futomaki, which means fat roll right now that you know about the spicy tuna.
let 's get rolling time to roll.
all right here we go with most rules, we start out with a half sheet of nori.
there 's two sides to the nori nice glossy side, and then you have kind of a rough textured side.
and then you want the texture sign up and then you get a ball of rice make sure your hands are wet.
so the rights to stick to them again.
we 're going to want to do squish and push about the side.
it 's bullshit and you push it.
but with a spicy tuna roll you do n't want to go all the way to the end.
so use your fingertips push it to the edges.
now you 're going to want to turn it ninety degrees, and this one you 're not going to flip over the first thing.
i 'd like to put in the role is lettuce, i like to cut it in half and then put it so the ends are so.
a little bit of it is sticking out.
it looks nicer that way second.
i 'd like to put in you cumbers.
instead of just put it like this.
it looks a little bit nicer.
if you cut it in half first on an extreme bias, and then stick it in the middle third i like to do avocado.
now just like before you scoop all the avocado, witherspoon, just like that , right.
and then the final thing you want to put it is spicy tuna moo.
and i like to put it in a big ball right in the middle from here.
you just use your fingers and then again do tuck and roll.
so talk it, and then you roll just like that.
next , you grab your makisu or your role thinking, lay it over the top and then give it a squeeze.
then you want to get your knife wet.
and then some places like to cut it into for some places like to cut it into six we at the social house.
like cut it into five just like that now that was n't so hard.
do n't forget to hit the like button and the subscribe button?
and then i 'll show you how to make sushi that looks like this time for the question of the day, when was the first time you ate sushi, and what did you order.
thank you for watching sushi, my theory.
