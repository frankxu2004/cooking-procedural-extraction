welcome , again to bake your way kitchen on today 's video.
i 'm going to show you how to make a tomato suit.
a nice fresh tomato soup, great for the summer, great quite frankly, all year round, it 's just a great, great delicious recipe, and it 's.
so easy to make.
so i 'm just going to show you what you need to get started.
so what i 've got here is a large saucepan and i 've got about three two, two three tablespoons of oil, and we 're going to preheat the oil and put the in a bit.
but before i get to that.
let 's get to the tomatoes.
yes , for this simply are using fresh tomatoes so you 'll probably need about two pounds worth and i 've got a mixture of things here.
so i 've got regular tomatoes, i think i 've got two or three here and then i 've got about two hundred grams of cherry tomatoes and basically, i put a little bit of olive oil and a little bit of vinegar, and it really brings out that tomato flavor will need to preheat your oven to about four hundred degrees and then, and, then, and then cut your tomatoes accordingly if their cherry tomatoes obviously, you do n't need to cut them.
and they 're going to go into the oven, which i will do right now for about i would say probably about twenty minutes.
so i 'm going to put the sim sorry to make sure that goes in properly alright.
so now in the mean time i 've got my oil here, as i mentioned, i 'm going to go over to the stove preheat, the oil, and add in the onions an let them sate till the till.
they start to sweat out a bit.
and i 'll show you the next step.
the onions caramelize really sweat it out.
you can see usually when they 're really glossy.
that 's a really good indicator.
so now we 're going to do is that in our garlic put it near the end of the major like when you 're cooking over high heat.
your onions, because you do n't want the garlic, garlic has a tendency to burn.
so you really want to avoid that.
so you want to give this a mix for twenty thirty seconds.
just so that carol it kind of gets infused a little bit.
so now we 're going to be adding in a few additional ingredients, and i will show you that right.
now the first thing i 'm going to add is about one and a half cups of stock.
now you could use chicken stock.
i 'm using vegetable stock to keep this vegetarian.
i 'm also going to add in some peel tomatoes.
this is a twenty eight fluid ounce seven hundred ninety six milliliters can do.
you , wanna get this in this when fully open some kind of doing this on its side.
so you want to give us a little bit of a mix.
we want to give this a little bit of salt and pepper, and if you 're roasted tomatoes are out of the oven, if it 's been twenty minutes twenty five minutes then just leave them on the side, will use them in a bit on a little bit more salt and did n't really had a lot there?
we go so we 're going to give us a quick mix, and one thing i 'm going to do.
i always do with the canned tomatoes.
i 'm just going to.
i always take a little bit of water to get out all those tomato juice.
is there perfectly good there?
we go so now we 're going to let this come up to a boil.
once it 's come up to a boil.
i 'm going to reduce the heat and cover it for about ten or fifteen minutes.
and this will allow some of the excess of liquid to evaporate and at that point, we will put in the roast tomatoes.
i 'll show you first.
what that looks like when it comes to the boil.
then , when and then after it 's been covered, so i 'll be back in just a second is come to a boil.
so now what we 're going to do is reduce the heat and i 'm also going to add in some fresh basil leaves, if you do n't have fresh basil leaves first of all, you can use sweet, italian red, whatever it is, you want.
i 'm using about a third of a cup you could use more or less, i actually growing basil outside, and the garden.
and so it smells phenomenal.
i 'm telling you, if you can get your hands on fresh basil.
it really will take this soup from here to way, up here and one of the great things about this tomato soup that we 're making it 's perfect for even like a sauce for like spaghetti or something.
so i 'm going to have a baked pasta video coming up, and you can easily use this recipe as a substitute anyway.
i 'm just going to cover this now, and it 's on me.
so we 're going to let this simmer for about ten to fifteen minutes, annual notice that will thicken up a bit.
and i 'll show you the next step alright.
so as you can see i 'll try to show you are, tomatoes have been simmering for quite awhile.
there 's been some liquid that 's evaporated.
but it 's still going to be some now my tomatoes are ready.
i 've got my tomatoes here, and i 'm just going to add them in whoops there.
we go so now we 're going to do is we 're going to quickly get the soul.
first of all, we 're going to continue over medium heat.
if it 's on low, you can bring it up to medium.
and we 're going to let this cook you can either do it covered or uncovered.
if you feel like it 's very running you can cover it if you prefer for about five or ten minutes.
just so that it comes up to a bit of a simmer and then we 're going to go ahead and use the emergen blender.
now just before we get there.
i just want to be careful if you 're using an emergen blender be very careful.
make sure you have high sides.
because if you 're not careful, it could splatter everywhere and the absolute worst thing in the world.
catos , splatter all over your kitchen.
it 's a mess and it 's such a disaster, so try to avoid that.
so i 'm going to go off camera.
but i 'll be back when we blended altogether.
so i 've let that cook for a little while.
i covered it and it 's looking great.
it 's thickened up a bit.
it 's got an amazing tomato smell now.
here 's the thing normally, actually there 's a few options, normally you can either just blend this says, is or you could go, and it pick out the basil leaves.
i personally do n't mind the basil leaves left.
and it 's up to you, you can take them out if you want.
i 'm going to leave my name, so this is the part we need to be very careful about an.
i am just praying to god that this does n't go everywhere, so basically you take your immersion blender.
if you do n't have an emergen blender, you can use a food processor slowly, go like this, just around, and as you do more, you can mix that longer.
but just for the beginning be careful.
and you just want to keep mixing around it 'll take a few minutes.
so i 'll show you what it looks like once.
it 's done period through now, if you really want a nice smooth cream of tomato soup or tomato soup, you can put it through a sieve.
if that 's you, that 's absolutely fine.
you can just take the extra time to strain it to make sure you get all of that out.
do n't want it?
but the final step i 've preheat i 've heated this up a little bit i 'm adding in about a tablespoon or so, parmesan.
you could add a little more low less than what you want.
now , you could add about you could add a little bit of whipping cream.
but what i 'm going to do is add a couple tables and a little dash of milk, and this will make it a little bit creamy there.
we go there.
we go and once you 've mixed this in we 're going to adjust it for seasoning so i 'm going to take a taste great.
let 's see, how it 's like oh, it 's at that is very good, that is, very good.
it 's so it 's got this nice tomato flavor, and i 'm telling you, using real tomatoes, using good canned tomatoes using very good ingredients will make a huge difference.
i am going to add a little bit more salt, and i 'm probably going to add a little bit more pepper.
and i think that 's going to be perfect.
so what do you do.
now , well, it 's up to you, you can serve it as is, or you can serve it with some crunchy bread, or with croutons.
you can make this with a pasta dish.
it 's really up to you.
i hope you enjoyed this recipe, thanks for watching and i 'll see you in the next video.
