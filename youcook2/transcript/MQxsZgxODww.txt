hi , everyone, my name is chef raylan G, and i 'm here at turners yard, and i 'm going to give you my take on boudin, noodle soup.
it 's a classic asian dish now, who don noodles are there a package right here.
you can get these in any local grocers.
any you 're asian markets.
it 's a big fat wide noodle.
it 's a big flower noodle, so these are great.
you can do anything you want with them.
you can use any kind of soup today.
we 're going to a traditional soup, and i 'm going to add my little twist to it.
so for the ingredients for the soup, are chosen these two types of mushrooms, some boudin noodles, some carrots some snap peas.
sam bamboo shoots, some sprouts and a little bok, choy.
we have some broth.
and we 're going to saute all our vegetables in a little sesame E oil.
this is going to give us a nice asian flavor that i like.
so i 'm going to start off with a little bit of sesame E.
oil get my pan hot.
i 'm going to put in some carrots some mushrooms now.
i 've also chose to use some enoki mushrooms.
i 'm going to save those to the end, because those are really, really delicate.
they give a great flavor and i basically just garnish the soup with it, it 's a great colorful dish.
it 's very, very vibrant.
you can add me to it.
you can add port to it chicken beef.
it 's up to you now since i 'm using chicken stock.
i 'm not going to add salt and pepper to it.
i 'm going to make it a very light brophey soup.
i 've already sees in my broth.
so i do n't feel i need to add any more flavor.
should i want to pull the flavors from the vegetables so it 's going to give me that nice vegetable flavor?
now we 're down my bok, choy.
i do n't want to add too much of it.
i just want to give it just kind of wilt in a little bit.
i do n't want to overcook it.
so what i 've got going on i 've got some great, great flavors coming off of this, oh, man alright.
so now i 've got that, that cooking and simmering.
i think my vegetables are pretty much ready for my bra.
so what i 'm going to do is we take some vegetable broth that i have.
i 'm gonna let my veggies finished cooking in this broth.
oh , smells awesome.
so it that cook we 'll let simmer for probably about a couple minutes.
but we want to get that nice and hot and then we 're going to add on noodles to it.
so these are the good on noodles and nice and thick.
i 've already precooked him you want to cook him for a couple minutes.
you do n't want to overcook him.
i like him cook a little bit chewy, so we 're going to cook these in here, and that smells fantastic OK, perfect.
all right, as perfect, just the way i want it, now.
i 'm going to finish with those enoki mushrooms.
i was talking about these beauties that just so small so delicate.
i do n't want to overcook him.
so i 'm going to play some around the top going to let us to like that, and this will incorporate when you come you can eat these mushrooms.
raw you can cook them you can saute, am i chose lee on top, so my name is jeffrey alan G.
and this is my version of boudin, noodle soup.
