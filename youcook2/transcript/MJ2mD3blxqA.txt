today , i 'm going to show you how simple it is to make a roman dish from scratch, using the skills and tools that we 've learned in the last few episodes.
so let 's get cooking.
there are four basic types of ram and there 's shio, shoyu, tonkotsu, anemi, so today will be making assure you style rahman.
this is what you 're going to need.
you 'll need rama noodles green onions, eggs, chicken broth, soy sauce and hot sauce.
now , the first thing we 're going to do is bring a pot of water to a boil.
if you 're thinking about adding salt for quicker, boil think, again because salt only needs to be added if you 're trying to season whatever you 're boiling.
adding salt raises the boiling point which means the water will actually take more time to come to a boil.
once the water starts to boil, add the eggs.
and then let them boil for five minutes, turn off the stove cover, the pot with a lid, and let them sit for an additional five minutes, do n't over cook the eggs now?
let 's cook the noodles to boiling water and let them cook for about seven minutes to make the base.
heat up the chicken broth in another pot and add fresh ground pepper and sea salt.
allow this mixture to come to a full boil while you wait for your base to boil.
put your noodles and egg into a serving bowl chop up.
some veggies for some added flavor now roman can be served with sliced bamboo shoes sliced pickled ginger green onions, even being sprouts, there are.
some must have asian spices to make this authentic ram.
it , i 'm making sure you rum.
and so will need success and add some chili garlic hot sauce for the extra cake.
now , once your bases come to a boil poured over your noodles, eggs, and onions in the serving bowl.
drizzle your soy sauce over the top.
and there you have it one order of homemade rum and just for you, be sure to experiment with it just a little bit 'cause cooking is always more.
when you can put your own spin on it.
