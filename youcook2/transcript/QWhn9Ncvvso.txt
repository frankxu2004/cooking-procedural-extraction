everyone i 'm do rhonda and today i 'm making a BLT sandwich.
i 've got about five slices of bacon here that i have baked and if you 've never heard of bacon, bacon.
go ahead and check out my youtube video on how to bake bacon, i do n't think you 'll ever go back to the frying pan once you try it over here.
i have mayonnaise now.
i love mayonnaise on my VL, TS, if you do n't like it, keep it off, but to me it makes all the difference in the world.
i put a little fresh cracked pepper on my BLT.
my family loves of course.
the romaine lettuce, so we use romaine lettuce.
it 's a real hardy lettuce, iceberg or any other lettuce that 'll do.
then , of course, we got a beautiful red tomato here and then back here i have some bread that i posted.
i have a whole wheat bread.
now you may use whichever bread that you like.
it is your preference that to get the BLT assemble take a little mayonnaise.
i go from side to side, make sure to get all the corners OK just pick it up there.
she how i 'm doing it and, and there 's nothing better than a delicious, fresh be LT.
i think it is the best and now i 'm going to go ahead.
still , a little mayonnaise here on the other side, and now to get this assembled.
and i 'm going to go ahead and get this serving plate out of the way.
is that are two slices and toast here?
and then i start off on one side, and i just layer the bacon slices.
OK , just like that, you think they 're little, too long you can cut him into no big deal.
if you do n't like him sticking out over the edge and then of course, you 're going to put your romaine lettuce or whichever.
one is she, like over here on this side, i think you 're going to take your tomato.
and i 'm gonna give it a nice little.
device , oh, my gosh.
this tomato looks absolutely delicious like how beautiful that turns out.
i 'm going to just make a nice slice.
