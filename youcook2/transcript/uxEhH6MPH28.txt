hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com, with in my recipe for buttermilk fried chicken when my favorite recipes of all time and not that hard to put together and just for fun i 'm going to show you how i breakdown a whole chicken for fried chicken.
i 'm a take off the wing tips those are useless imadi joint, the wings, right with the attached to the body the thigh leg section comes off do n't be afraid to snap in dislocate and then that gets caught between the drumstick and thigh yes this is quick.
but watch it seventy times you 'll see.
so once the legs and thighs are done i 'm left with basically the carcass, which has the backbone and the breasts, annual notice i 'm using a nice heavy cleaver the ultimate tool for chicken breakdown.
snap the backbone like that cut the breast in half and in each breast gets cut in two pieces, and you 'll notice here when i cut the breast in half.
i slice down till i hit the bone, and then i give it one pound with my hand so it goes through in one shot.
nice and clean otherwise you get like bone fragments.
so there 's my four breast pieces my two thighs, drumsticks and the two wings all right into the bullet goes, black pepper salt.
pep rica dried herbs white pepper cayenne.
and that gets tossed all the bleeder, not eleven herbs and spices will be on this site OK after that 's, well, tossed with these spices and herbs, you 're going to top it with buttermilk, and we 're going to let that sit for six hours.
you can get away with four, you can go over night if you want.
but i like six hours.
we 're going to make some seasoned flour, which is just flour salt.
some pep rica, some cayenne.
some garlic powder some white pepper, and some onion powder so give that a mix.
after the buttermilk, marination, the chicken pieces get dredged, oh, my god.
there 's a fire truck going by hate.
when that happens the chicken gets dredged in that season flower, well, there you want it really nicely coded, give it a little shake off.
put on a plate.
and then we 're ready to fry and what we 're going to do.
and there 's lots of different ways to fry this.
a dutch oven.
it 's a big eight quart dutch oven and i have about two and a half quarts of oil in there.
and i 'm going to fry all eight pieces at once now.
some people like to fry in a skillet in just like an inch or two of oil, and then they do it in batches, and they turn it halfway, through, you know, i do n't have the patients.
i wanted all be done at the same time, of course, this uses twice the oil.
but how often do you make fried chicken like once a year, so at three fifty, i 'm going to cook that for about ten minutes.
place , crust, i 'm going to go in after ten minutes and just move it around a little.
just in case, some pieces are stuck together.
i want to cook evenly.
that 's going to go for about another ten to fifteen minutes.
so it 's about twenty, twenty five minutes total in the hot oil to cook all the way through now, well, that 's finishing up i 'd like to take a rack and put it on some paper towels on a sheet pan.
and that 's why i 'm going to use to a drain the cooked chicken on.
so , that 's ready and the chickens ready look at that unbelievably beautiful.
so again, it 's been about twenty to twenty five minutes total in the oil.
i 'm going to fish it out with my spider that little strainer thing.
you see, there an what beautiful chicken and possibly crispy amazingly, delicious do n't bite into it for about ten minutes.
you wo n't enjoy it, it just burn yourself.
so ten minutes later, we had a delicious plate of fried chicken, and i just could not bring myself to eat this in front of you but trust me.
it was every bit as good as it looks, that is not a hard recipe.
it does take a little bit of work, but completely worth it.
so like i said eleven herbs and spices blued or not or what was included in this, you can go to the site.
count them yourself is all the ingredients are listed there and as always enjoy.
