hey folks, uh, so the other day, i was invited to the world renowned river cottage.
i went on their fishing courses, which is really, really cool.
it would like fishing at by the sea for a few hours.
there 's loads of us, the first time i 've ever fished in my life was going to hook my ear, but was a really cool experience.
and then we went back to river college and learn how to prepare fish, which is really cool, too.
and one is that the video collaboration and learn how to make an.
this is no lie.
the best fish and chips in the world have ever, ever, ever, ever tasted, and today.
i replicate it at home.
but if you want to watch the original video then go check out and subscribe to river, cottage channel.
but this is how i just made it.
an is amazing, will start off with a homemade chunky, tartar sauce in a bar, combined.
the mayonnaise two chopped hard boiled eggs.
capers , some fresh deal that i chopped up a shallot that chopped.
so nice and fine and half a lemon just to do.
so only give it a good mixed together and, that is, the title source done next.
i made this squished peas with butter.
and so, so good in a pound.
i poured in my piece with a little bit of water and simmer them through for about three to four minutes until they 're cooked and all it in my butter and mint, turned off the heat and use the residual heat to just mix it through melt the butter and believe it or not , we.
gotta do then is squish.
it , with the back of a wooden spoon.
and , that is done to for the beer batter for fish.
all it did was grab a bowl plants in our plain flour.
a little pinch of salt just a season it a little bit, and gradually add in some beer, whisking it at a little bit more until it was motion smoothing code like the thick consistency of cream.
and if you got any leftover and got my soul like is circle excuse to drink you up.
so just leave it better to one side just for a minute for the chips.
i use maris piper potatoes here, is the life cycle so you 've gone unpeeled, one appealed one and ones that have sliced into chips.
slightly the chips and tip them into a pan of simmering water for round about ninety seconds to two minutes.
and then just drain it off straight away through a kolander while you empty a pan.
get a slightly larger one fill it with sunflower oil and get it nice and hot fry.
the ships initially for five minutes until they just start to brown and then it should drain on kitchen towel.
so i tipped it through a calendar into a pan and then shook him onto a tea towel, and just dabbed a little bit that worked out all right and then cranked up the heat on the hub to get the oil a little hotter.
put the chips back in and cook them fruit until there.
nice and golden brown.
and repeated that drain off steps and put it on the kitchen towel.
if not, or i did mine for the calendar and T tower, style baby.
do n't you fish into the premade batter and make sure it 's nice and coated shaking off any access and dump it straight into that pan where the chips have just came out of the oil is nice and hot?
and you want to cook it through for at about four five minutes.
and golden brown and all you gotta do then is punk on a plate and serve it all up it is looking amazing.
trust me, there is so good, oh, my goodness.
guys , when i first learned how to make this over at river cottage.
i said at the time, it is the best fish and chips ever tasted which is a bold statement 'cause i live by the sea here in the UK or fish and chips is super traditional.
so much flavor in it.
i really wanna, partly salt or any vinegar catch or anything like that, so many flavor dimensions.
the tartar sources chunky.
i could just eat that as it is on its own.
we gotta buttery mini peas as well so good, so if you have a go at this recipe send me a picture at my virgin kitchen.
remember to check out the original video over on the river cottage channel of me learning how to make this, and go subscribe to way there, and i think it 's only fair that he wanted this right now, see you.
