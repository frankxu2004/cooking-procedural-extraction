hello , this is chef john from food wishes, dot com and today.
we 're doing roll your own sushi as promised.
you made your sushi rice, an.
now it 's ready to roll some california rolls and you 're going to need one of these this is a bamboo sushi mat very cheap you 'll get that your local sushi supply store or the sushi department at walmart and once you get one of those are going to happen in plastic wrap you also need for your fingers, some ice water or cold water and some vinegar splash net, it 's just rice, vinegar and that 's going to make.
so the click tear fingers are going to need one of these nori seaweed sushi wrappers you 're going to place that on your bamboo sushi mat shiny side down you 're going to take a snowball size handful of sushi rice and going to spread evenly over the entire surface now, spread it before you start padding down you want it all evenly distributed and then you can lightly tap it down, you just wanted on there enough to stick 'cause we 're going to turn this over.
so once that 's set you 're going to flip it over we 're going to put down a couple pieces of avocado, and i 'm going to use a little bit of a fake crab salad, the donations have been a little slow this week.
so anyway, i 'm going to fake crab with just a little touch of mayonnaise and salt and pepper.
and i 'm going to put a nice little layer of that, and not too much.
if you put too much you ca n't roll these.
so you 're going to do looks periment, NG.
but you see how much i have there not a ton.
and then you 're going to kind of roll your mat up.
i 'll do this real slow here and the top will fold right over in that crab and avocado will stay right in the middle and see how that works.
now let me pull this into the middle here a little bit second.
i basically finished the role so once you roll it and just got to be a little careful this when you start it.
but once it starts turning over then just push it down with your fingers do n't press like with all your weight.
you just want to know if see that to stick the rice together right then.
you want to kind of make it into a round shape, you can make into a square shape, half circle them at.
let you kind of shape it anyway.
you want, and that 's it now again.
be careful not to over press it.
you want the sushi rice still kind of crumble when you eat it.
and if you press too hard, it does get a little gummy.
and that 's it.
we 're going to take a wet thin knife.
your sharpest blade you 're going to cut right through that and look at that hey.
that 's not bad for a italian polish russian chef cook.
now sometimes if you think you 're good you can line up a few together and cut him like that.
i like to shake a little sesame E seed on there.
some people put that in the rice or on the rice or in the role.
i just shake it on top.
there 's my soy sauce.
my pickled ginger and my decoratively scored with sabi lump, and that 's it.
it 's a hell of a lot cheaper karma donations, and i do n't know how you say you can do it in japanese.
but if i knew how i would say that, so as promised there 's your california sushi roll.
check the site for more details, and as always enjoy.
