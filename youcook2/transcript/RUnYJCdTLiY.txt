hi guys, and learn, but alley on the suppose, it.
i belong in the kitchen.
i 'm going to show you how to make basic pancakes.
now it is absolutely absurd that i have not made an episode on this.
already , i mean, what it was i thinking i 've been gone.
i 've been doing this for two years, and not made a simple plain pancake recipe, and even, even dawn on me like just recently.
i thought all these requests are coming in.
i must not have an episode up already, so i did it.
and i apologize for that.
and i 've gotten just so many requests to make basic pancakes.
it is one of the most, if the E, one, the easiest recipes you 'll ever make.
and this is my recipe that i have been using for years and, years, and, years and when you see how easy it is to make you 'll never go back to the last stuff.
so of course before we get started.
let 's go ready ingredients, it going some all purpose flour some whole milk egg baking powder sugar, salt and a little bit of butter those, are you crazy ingredients?
can you believe it now?
the methods of pancakes.
my method anyway is the one method.
it 's one of everything so it 's a cup of flour.
a cup of milk a teaspoon of baking soda a tablespoon of salt a teaspoon of salt in an egg that 's it anything that little bit of butter to cook them in.
but just by using the one, one, one, one, one ratio perfect thanks, every single time two cups of flour two cups of milk, two eggs two, seven, seven.
so given saying so, it could n't be easier.
so in this form, i 'm going to make all my ingredients at my flower i have my milk, and you can use skim milk for this.
whatever you have on hand egg.
my baking powder sugar, and you put a little sugar in my recipe, which i know.
it 's a bit.
different , but i feel like they need just a tiny bit of sweetness.
so i do it and it works for me.
and you do n't want to over mix this and lumpy batter is a good batter.
it 's going to be really fluffy, and delicious if you overbeat this, it 's going to be really dense and heavy.
so see what i did.
i just ever so lightly mix it together.
it 's completely done now.
another important step is that you let this sit for about five, ten minutes.
a relaxes the glue in which means you 're going to get a really fluffy pancake.
so i 'm just going to clean up.
let this leave it alone for about five minutes, or so, and then we 're ready to cook him up.
my battery has been resting for about five minutes, so we are ready to cook them up.
now i have a little grill here that 's been preheating are a medium heat and all i 'm going to do is take a little bit of, is a stick of butter?
you could do whatever you want increasing, however, you want and i 'm just going to lightly grease it.
because i do n't want a ton of butter like, i do n't want a tablespoon of butter to cook my pancakes in maybe.
i 'm just a big weirdo.
i do n't know.
but i do n't like the taste of pancakes cooked in a ton of butter, do n't ask, i do n't, i 'm a bit strange.
i do n't know so you every batter, ready just give this a nice little stir that 's perfect.
i 'm not even going to bother going any further with that, and now we 're just going to cook him up.
i 'm going to use a little bit in a ladle like this, and just put them right onto your griddle and these are going to cook up.
and once you start to see bubbles then, you know, you are ready to flip them, and i 'll show you what that looks like just write.
it flip my last two.
and as you can see all the little bubbles on top that 's when you know, you 're ready to flip.
see that perfect.
and i always find out your first batch of pancakes always come out a little bit wonky, donkey.
but then the rest of them come out perfect, do n't ask why it just do.
but they 're going to look for another thirty seconds.
if that they really cook in no time on the second time when you flip them, you just looking for that beautiful golden color going to remove in needham here we go.
and , that is out quick and easy.
everyday pancakes, which i look at the color of those.
i have just got to just get myself a tease.
you can top him with butter.
i do n't tell him with butter.
i just like a little maple syrup over the top, like and simple.
i , like a good i want to eat some whoops.
i 'm gonna get up a fight like that one, oh god perfect, every single time it does n't get any easier than one, one, one, one, one.
remember that, but the recipe is going to be on WWW dot lauren kitchen dot com.
so go on there.
get the recipe printed out.
if you want to then get in your kitchen tomorrow morning and make these pancakes because they are so good, so see you later.
