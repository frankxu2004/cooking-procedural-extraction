hi , everybody welcome back to the real life, kitchen my name is mike benninger, owner operator of chef mike dot CA today, or making.
one of my favourites, caesar salad, i 'm going to start off here with like with all good things start off with garlic.
this , a microplane.
are you even got one of these planes, garlic, and chocolate bar than anything in the world?
start off one clove.
if you like more add more like les atlas anchovy paste.
now anchovy face is to leave salt a layer of flavor.
not everybody likes it.
but , you know, what it adds something to do it with.
you do n't have it.
you 'll notice it 's missing.
and that 's not good.
lemon juice, use lime juice, even use vinegar.
i prefer lemon juice, watch the seeds, though the seeds are n't very nice.
egg yolks, egg yolks are better than egg whites or whole egg dressings.
i prefer yokes their richer through also safer, so i have two and there is only one i have one that 's up to you.
i like a little more richness, so we 're going to have to mustard, you serve you like this happens to be a grainy, dijon.
if you wanna use a super hot one that 's up to you if you wanna, use a mild one that 's up to you as well again.
it 's all of a preference issue.
it 's about a teaspoon there.
now , you mix it up.
now you 'll notice here.
i have nothing in here, that is a preservative.
i have nothing in here that 's not the highest of quality ingredients when you get stuff and bottles that is n't always the case.
parmesan cheese is only one cheese for this primary owner.
reggiano , you can tell it, reggiano.
'cause it has the red journal label on the rind, right in the side there it 's very expensive is about forty five dollars.
a kilo, but that 's what it costs, and you only use a little that 's probably a maybe a teaspoon to tablespoon and a half maybe i do n't know, eighty five cents worth for the entire break that 's there it 's worth using the very, very best of ingredients.
so let 's recap with cheese we have eggs with garlic now, we 're going to add some pepper fresh craft is always the best.
we 're going to add some sea salt.
we got the we 've added mustard now.
we had some olive oil and again spend the money and by the good stuff.
extra virgin is worth it and just slowly drizzle it in 'cause what you 're doing the fat that 's in the egg yolks is mixing up with the oil in your creative ones, called an emotion in a blend this, through you can just go through every gently do n't want to rush this whole thing, though from start to finish, takes about four five minutes, that 's about all.
now there 's my dress little taste test salty sweet i think it 's a little more lemon and that.
but that 's just me, and i think needs a little more garlic.
but again, i like lots of garlic, and mine put that in there at the micro planer, microplane, are about thirty bucks available at zehrs, fortinos rookie in superstores, evens dollars within chasm, their fantastic tools, chocolate cheese, garlic nutmeg , fantastic.
so there 's are dressing, creamy and rich, i 'm going to take half of it out.
because one of the problems you have and go to restaurants as they put in too much dressing.
so going to add some lettuce.
so add your romaine.
now I, I, I do n't obsess about having every single piece exactly the same size it 's important that it 's washed and properly dried expense when the water in there going to water down your dressing an water.
does n't taste as it is dressing does so cover.
this , all up when you go to restaurants what they do is they add too much dressing.
i want to have the flavor of the garlic.
i want to taste the flavor of the lettuce.
that 's why i 'm mixing it up like this can add more later you can always add more dressing.
you can always add more.
lettuce , it 's hard to take it out.
it does n't work the same way.
that 's why i 'm always very cautious about adding too much dressing in a hurry, so here 's your salad.
this will keep four, oh, the dress is good for a day or two.
that 's about all.
there is no preservatives in it in raw egg yolks, you know, you always want to be cautious of those, even though the eggs encounter of the very, very high.
so quality, i 'm always very cautious.
so i would take this take our lovely dress park that out from scratch seven read ingredients available very easily ingredients everywhere for every forty knows every loblaws, every, sobeys, every store in the area will always have all the things, you need to make this caesar salad i think the flavors are incredible i always finish this off with some fresh parmigiano, reggiano in fact, i always lots of parmesan reggiano just like that the girl that comes after that my coplanar adds, district best ever couple twist of fresh cracked pepper and there you go ladies and gentlemen start to finish five six seven minutes available everywhere inexpensive quality ingredients, quality flavors my name is mike, manager owner of chef might dot CA and a frequent friend of the real life kitchens thank you very much.
