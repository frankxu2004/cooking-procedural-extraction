were adam and joanne from inspired taste dot net and welcome to our kitchen?
we 're making a red pepper hummus recipe.
it 's creamy, smooth and so much better than store bought today.
we 're roasting our own peppers, but giard store bought peppers work really, well, too, to speed things up.
we cut the peppers into large flat pieces.
then we place them skin side up on a baking sheet, slide them under a hot broiler and cook until the skin has charred.
throw the roasted peppers into a dish with a lid or food.
and then set them aside to steam now on to the hummus combine lemon juice and tahini in a food processor.
this is actually homemade.
tahini look for our recipe on inspired taste, if you do n't want to make your own simply use store bought process, the lemon juice and tahini for a minute scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and processed some more the extra time helps whipped the tahini which means we 're on our way to smooth and creamy, hummus add olive oil minced garlic ground khuman, cayenne pepper, and some salt, then process again scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl when you need to we use a whole can of chickpeas for this.
but like to add them in two batches after adding the second batch of chickpeas process one to two minutes or until the hummus is thick and quite smooth grab the peppers from earlier and gently peel away the blackened and charred pepper skin reserved one to two pieces to use as a garnish then roughly trap the rest add the peppers to the food processor and process until very smooth match up the leftover peppers into small pieces scrape the hummus on to a dish make a small, well, in the middle and top with the peppers enjoy thanks for watching look for full recipes on inspired taste dot net and be sure to check out more of our videos on our youtube channel.
