we have had absolutely loads of requests for some vegan recipes, so if you 're vegan or not trust us.
you , gonna love this one.
so , obviously vegan food is all about cooking with ingredients that do n't come from animals, so it 's not just meat animal products as well, in today.
we 're going to do falafel balls.
so that 's based around chicopee, and then we 're adding to it.
onion line for fresh herbs, spices, loader flavors, will save the couple of dips?
and some toasted picture at all right.
now , we need to ingredients up if you have n't got blender, you can just match them up before, but to be honest with it.
we 're going to table.
that has, so chickpeas go in there, too.
that if you can add coriander, and, parsley and then if you can crush the cloves garlic, meanwhile, i 'm going to chop up an onion.
the beauty about all of these ingredients is that not only did fridge.
so it 's the kind of thing that comes great festival food as well, this thing, you can match up in a bar with minnifield, yeah, absolutely you might still need to plan on their first there 's quite delicate.
but hang on the barbie work just the same.
because we 're blending up.
it does n't have to be too fine.
if you can throw those in those robots so you might want, is a vegan cheating often from wendy 's recipes for ages?
now you can go in on me about it or there.
we go hopefully this will please you.
so we need a couple of spices to go in.
here , as well, some chili powder add a teaspoon of that give the cake march madness you want.
but at some tasty contact more later, on, little bit of ground cumin goes in there.
and then the sort of thing comes from a line.
so if you can give that a good role battery stop, interrupting, you get a lot more juice out of it.
and then we just cut it in half and squeeze as much of that into their as possible now check.
these are quite dry.
but we are adding that lime juice and a little bit of sesame E or now.
send me the flavor associated published cycle.
tahini paste, you had a little bit of that like so.
but because we do n't need those two liquid, we are going to compensate, have flower.
so that two tablespoons of plain flour goes into imaginas?
one has a dry out there, it makes it easier to mold or we need to do is put the lid on and will end away take off.
give a quick season, and it 's sort of pepper people actually powering their season deals in that we teach, yeah, well.
because it 's all wrong, we can we just give it a quick test agency.
how much do you want.
no , not right now, but actually fresh herbs really lifted.
it 's nice job done.
and now we need to move it.
now for lateral can be made into any shapes, patties or sausage shapes.
but we did n't get the balls.
so dull, full size pieces and go take them out squeeze it 'cause you will get some moisture come out of that.
get good squeeze, and then what 's left just kind of rolled into a bull.
try making all the same size.
but as ever size does n't matter skillful is bigger than mine.
no comment, this much easy with clean wet hands.
actually , if you dampen your hands with four sometimes it 's easier, so there we go that 's those pretty much role for quick printer hands.
hot soapy water.
and now we can start to cook, but now you can bake this or just before the barbeque would work.
but we 're going to fry them.
so a little bit of oil in a pan.
then , we just pop up falls into the pan, so you get a nice little.
and if you contact them enough, they should all hold their shape.
so , well, at least cook through for a few minutes, turning them every.
so often we can put our pizza bread into the toaster to warm those through and then we can set the whole lot with some dips and what we have falafel ready awesome.
but there we go get some pizza it 's nice and warm now, you can step that from one side of oxalate we 've got eight pepper and tomato dip and a taxi key bits and fresh flavors there and then are falafel.
balls will make a little bit of a pyramid game.
here 's we stack them up.
presentation is everything set it much little bit like our frail russia tower, 'cause this is a real treat.
so there we go some warm toted kids are couple of dicks and most importantly how vegan, falafel balls sorted, wow, which planes are mostly talk about the spice.
but nothing more i 'm a dunk.
now these awesome.
but if you want to make these are home been up to burger versions or sausage versions, please do send photos to our facebook page facebook com forward.
