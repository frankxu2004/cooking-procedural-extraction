how do you say friend one?
thank you cook with april on TC tuesday today.
we 're going to make chicken parmesan or parmesan chicken.
however you wanna, say it, it is so delicious and tender and moist, so states even learn how to make it go ahead.
an makes bread crumbs and parmesan cheese in a bowl.
and , mix those ingredients together and then transfer it onto a plate.
it 's easier to coat your chick in on a plate than you would in a bowl.
so now go ahead and grab any chicken breast of your choice and place it in a zip lock bag and go ahead and use a meat tenderizer and whack it away, then grab your chicken breast and rub some salt as well as pepper on each side of the chicken breast.
then you 're gonna go ahead and rub some flour on it as well on both sides and then dip your chicken breasts in beaten eggs and go ahead and coat your chicken breasts with the parmesan cheese bread, crumb mixture, really pressing firmly.
so that you completely cover the chick in.
and while you 're doing that preheat the oven to four hundred fifty degrees an grab up frying pan.
and play some olive oil.
and then you 're going to go ahead an fry the chick in for only three minutes covering both sides, and making it brown.
this is not to cook the chicken completely.
it 's only to kind of hard in the outside layer and then place it any big safe pan and add some tomato sauce.
right on top of the chick in then, add mozzarella cheese.
and now you are ready to bake big for about fifteen minutes until the chicken breast is cooked, and this will have a very delicious crispy outside and tender inside.
enjoy , i 'm hungry.
this is my very first time making this, it looks pretty good.
i 'm pretty impressed alright.
i have n't eaten it yet.
did you take a big fight like usual?
my god, there 's so delicious, thank you, you know, me.
i typically prefer chicken thighs.
but this is chicken breast without sight picture.
additional thing to use with chicken parmesan.
but , that is delicious.
oh , my gosh.
you know, where i would typically eat your apartment on is that buca di beppo, if you guys have ever been, there, and i think this is close maybe even a little bit better, but, you know, the amount of cheese on this is perfect.
it 's not too much i love.
