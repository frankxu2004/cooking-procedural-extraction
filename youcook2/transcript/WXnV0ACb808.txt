hey , everyone in this video, i 'll be showing you how to make falafels.
this is a really weird vegetarian dish that uses simple and pretty, inexpensive in regions.
so , if you want to know how to make this keep watching in your food processor at the chick peas these are drastic.
be soaked overnight in water also at the fresh parsley, fresh coriander, leaves salt baking soda and black pepper.
also added, garlic onion and ground cumin blend everything together.
if necessary stop different processor and scrape down the sides of the bowl to enter even blending.
this is the final consistency should have.
it has a grainy texture likely all your hands and naked elbows with the dough, you can make this whatever size, you want.
but just try to make them as even as possible, so that they can cook evenly, it 's now time to deep fry.
i 'm using a to speak to check the earth temperature.
you can see that there is a steady bubbling going on that mean the early is ready.
but if you follow feels in the oil do n't put too many.
because that will bring the old temperature down let them cook for a few minutes until they get a deep brown color then remove them from the oil entering them on paper tower here is a close up of the outside chris and the inside.
i am quickly showing you how to make the tahini sauce to go with the falafel.
