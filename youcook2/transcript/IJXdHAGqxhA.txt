hi , everyone, and welcome back to another episode of honeysuckle catering today we 're going to be making korean food and i 'm going to be showing you how to make a really popular dish.
pull G after vietnamese food, of course, korean food is my favorite cuisine.
it 's so comforting spicy and so flavorful korean food is a great social food to be shared with friends and family.
you 're my family, so let 's get started so we can eat made a fourth cup of soy sauce.
two tablespoons of sesame E oil a tablespoon of brown sugar, two tablespoons of honey, a tablespoon of sesame E seed, a quarter teaspoon of red chili pepper.
flakes also called go to god.
oh , three cloves of garlic two stocks of green onion, a pound of sliced beef and half of a whole yellow onion in a large bowl combine your soy sauce.
sesame E oil sugar, honey and red chili pepper flakes, mix them well, now, take your three cloves of garlic minced them well, and add them to the wool.
now cut your yellow onion lengthwise and set aside.
now , take your green onions and sliced them.
i actually have a really cool tool that will shred them easily and make them look really pretty set aside a little bit of the green onions for garnish leader and then add in the rest of the onions, annuar beef into the soy sauce mixture.
finally added, the sesame E seeds and mix everything well, with your hands.
this is your easy marinade.
and we 're going to pop it in the fridge for about an hour to i 'd say five hours for the beef to soak up the flavors.
once your beef is done marinating take it out of the fridge.
take a heavy skillet.
put it on the stove at some oil and turn the heat up to medium, high, you want to cook your beef in batches.
so that it gives a nice chart.
if you cook, too much is going to end up seeming the beef, and it 's not going to be very good and there you have it, delicious pogo, guy with the green onions that we set aside earlier top it to garnish slow.
i love having it with rice.
