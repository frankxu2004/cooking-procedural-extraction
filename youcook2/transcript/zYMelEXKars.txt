hey , you guys, i 'm chef michael simon.
i 'm going to show you how to do one of my favorite things, tailgating we 're going to amp it up just a little bit.
we 're going to go from tailgating one.
oh , one to tailgating two, oh, one just by doing a couple little things to make your tailgate just a little better.
so my favorite thing when i 'm tailgating, it 's a little cold outside i love brought worse everybody those brought worse, and there 's a great way to do when your tailgating the first thing i do is, i like to poach him.
and then i finish him on the grill serve with a little bit of spicy mustard.
so we make this really poaching liquid, take some jalapenos split in half.
they leave couple clothes of garlic right into our pot, and we just chop up a red onion.
you , in order to get too cutesy with this whole thing, so that goes in next.
i 'd like to use a little bit of nob creek ride because it is spicy.
like my jalapenos, it 's going to add another layer flavor to the brought worst, which is going to make it extra delicious.
so we go with a little bit of the nob creek rye again, the better ingredients you use.
but more delicious, it 's going to be cooking, is really simple?
like that, we take your favorite beer.
i like, like a wheat beer would be great here.
put that whole veeran.
and then some water just enough, so we can cover our braatz nice pinch of salt some cracked black pepper now.
the reason that we do this is when you 're tailgating sometimes it gets a little crazy.
you do n't want to have to worry that much, so you want to keep it easy.
you want to it 's the kiss method you gotta keep it simple.
simon so put our braatz in the liquid.
we put this liquid over about a medium high on the grill.
it 's going to come up to a simmer as soon as it hits a simmer.
you could just drop it back down.
so they 're just going to cook through which you do n't have to worry about him over cook.
so these broad school in this liquid once at thirty minutes, the writing to go and then just drop that liquid down below a simmer.
they stay perfect throughout the entire game.
if you 're hanging in the parking lot when there ready and your friends are ready to eat, i just dropped him on the grill.
now they have all that great flavor.
throw a little chili 's in there the onions in the garlic, and you just took him something that 's kind of a classic and you made it a little bit better.
we get the char on.
'em , they 'll be ready to go.
and i spun some brown mustard.
it 's tailgate time.
