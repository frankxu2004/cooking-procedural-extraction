everyone on deronda with foods, one, oh, one and today, i 'm going to show you how to make this classic meatloaf.
it 's a favorite for anyone that i know that loves meatloaf to get this started.
you 're going to need two pounds of ground chuck.
this is just something you can buy in your meat department at the grocery store, i prefer ground shut because it has your less fat.
you 're going to need one cup of catch up tablespoons of brown sugar.
one shallot that i have minced finally two teaspoons of kosher salt, one half cup of minced red onions that i 've also chopped very finely this is wurster sure sauce.
this is two tablespoons.
i have one half cup of oatmeal one egg.
this is one teaspoon of time and a half.
a teaspoon of black pepper.
all right now to our meet, we 're going to make this very simple, you 're going to add the oatmeal the worcester sir sauce sometimes.
that 's hard to say the onions.
the sort shallots, one egg time and pepper now to this.
we 're going to add half the ketchup the other half we 're going to add to the top of our meatloaf once we get it in the shape we desire before banking.
so i 'm just going to use this about half of that, and now you 're going to combine these ingredients well in with your meat.
OK , now if you 'd like, you can get in there with a hand that now i just prefer.
using a wooden spoon and trying to get this all mixed.
in do you want to spend about three or four minutes on this and i 'll come back and show you what it looks like i 've got the beef combined with the other ingredients in.
here in a thirteen by nine inch porcelain pan that does n't need to be porcelain like the size of the thirteen by nine on line it with parchment paper.
here 's our meet, where we 've got all the other ingredients well incorporated.
and i 'm just going to put it right here in our baking dish, and i 'm using my hands.
and i 'm making the shape of our traditional meatloaf jesse parchment paper.
it makes it so much easier to clean up after you bake this scrumptious piece of entree here, you know, here in america we love meatloaf with mashed potatoes.
green bean corn, and then we love the leftover, meatloaf to slice and put on pieces of bread and have meatloaf sandwiches, meatless always delicious leftover, now.
i like the shape of this meatloaf now.
we 're going to take that leftover.
we 're going to add R two tablespoons of brown sugar, and you 're just going to combine these two ingredients, we will.
and also you want to make sure you got your oven preheating to three hundred and seventy five degrees.
fahrenheit , now once we have those ingredients together just going to add right here on to the top and spread it.
all around this is ready to go in the oven for the.
next fifty five minutes to one hour and we 're going to put this on the top rack and on the bottom rack.
i 've got a baking dish here that is going to bake along with our meatloaf that way.
it 'll keep the meatloaf nice and moist, and will keep the top from cracking.
so i 'll show you how i do it.
once i put it in the oven.
now you can see how i got the meatloaf on the top rack, and i 've got a pan of water here on the bottom now.
it 's time to close the oven door, and bake.
this for the next fifty five minutes to one hour here 's our delicious baked meatloaf just got it out of the oven.
oh , my goodness.
i 'll let it sit for about fifteen minutes cut into it and tell you what it tastes like time to give this a try ooh, yeah, look how hoisted is, and it 's got that catch up in that brown sugar there on top just like a classic meatloaf with the onions in there.
i am the, the time is coming through with that sugar.
