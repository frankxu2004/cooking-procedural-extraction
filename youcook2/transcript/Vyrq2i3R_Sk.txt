we append jamie barry and mike.
the guys are the horse of sorted food in this series of videos, we look at some of the most popular recipes that feature, lee and perrins, worcestershire source shepherds pie.
in my opinion is the family dish, but how do we make it out of the ordinary well, especially in paris in a few other flavors.
this is going to be special this recipe, we got selection of root vegetables will cook those off in besarta with some parents, which are source adullam.
it 's obviously the main base meat of this dish and top of the creamy mashed potatoes.
so stop with root veg.
they did the shopping, we got carrot onion celery and garlic, left handed or right hand.
both peeled and diced if you do the same with those two is this kind of dish you 'd have a home, you 're growing up with your family, definitely it seems to be one of those things that you cook.
that 's really nice feed a lot of.
people , it 's never something that i would order in a restaurant because if you ever seen on a restaurant that do n't think it 's considered restaurant.
it is more comforting for home, but there 's no reason why you should n't because the flavors and combinations are brilliant.
so onion carrot going into arrow and have a gentle heat.
we 're going to start cook those and sweating what we do n't too much color on them.
so gently is the key.
i understand your garlic and you take that, i mean, i 'm aware that i 've been peeling this for quite a long time.
so i might chalk it now.
just fingers, first.
so time is it gonna rain in there, also, at this stage is worth adding in a pinch of salt where it does draw some moisture out of the onions thing, in that cellar with visual stuff.
independent , current few minutes, or so allowed to go in as well.
how my plan was that and how many years is going to.
so this is five hundred grams of amix say four portions, because by the time you get all the source and the potatoes evokes the whole dish out there.
coming a burger, you want good two hundred grams of meat in eight ounce burger is pretty much get away with half back, and you 're making additional.
this is quite close thicker too, and really try to keep the heat up high on that.
can you want some good color on that lamp, while we wait for the meat to cook, we can crack on with our spuds?
this is with a creamy mash.
so if i quickly peel these and then all we want to do is chop them up into pieces golf ball, sized a lot smaller which means, uh, put quicker, they take on a lot of water and become quite waterlogged.
there 's a wet match rather than a nice creamy mash chosen marriage piper to use because i think it just gives a fluffier, meshes, well marriage type.
i do n't know what it is.
it 's typing potato.
you can just get wiped taters.
now they called, and just generic white potatoes or often in supermarkets.
actually label up as well they good for all these spots, can go into our cold shorted water and the reason?
i guess another tip is to how to make non lumpy mashed potato.
you want to put it all the way through.
so it 's really hard.
vegetable , cold or lukewarm or ten as it comes up to boil it starts to cook right through to the call before the outside get overcooked.
so bring that up to a boil, and they need to simmer for a good fifteen or twenty minutes until they cook the way through.
test them with a knife right now.
our shepherds pie that lamb mixture nicean cooked all the way through some golden color, started before we can add in all of our source ingredients.
so lamp stock and tomato puree next up to multiple sites.
now this is n't quite so traditional.
traditionally , it would just be lamps talk a lot more of it and reduce right down.
but factory, jamie did the flavor combination, said it works really well, with mark.
totally in paris d'amato, bloody marys things out there, but it 's not a softer going in there and finally, we need to add in some liam parents.
so generous splash that goes in there and then just before we leave it to simmer gently for about an hour.
we add in a bit more water now.
the reason is we put a stock cube in so this is kind of the balance of that for that 'll get grated often.
you 'll still be left in the same consistency, you started with except said chance.
will that meat to cook down the software so potatoes to cook for fifteen minutes, and then will drain the mash them adding in butter and milk?
and this needs to cook out for an hour or so, before construct dash empire.
this is the shepherds pie and make sure that we made earlier is also trying to cool.
but you can see how much thicker that is now and here, are potato, so they 've been drained, you can start to match those.
and now we need to add to that is plenty of milk do you want this.
super , super, creamy, and a good knob of butter.
but you do need to make sure you do.
is to season it so.
pincher , salts white paper.
if you do n't want the specs by quite lightly respects in there.
and then you can go onto a shepherds.
pie , this does n't have to be cold.
but it makes this stage a lot easier.
and then one other thing, i think is absolutely beautiful.
and as a cheesy mash, but we 're going to go for a little bit of blue cheese.
because the savory, umami favorite blue cheese, great, with all those other things in there that smarter than your parents, you 're not even going to greet over just a little bit.
now that can go into an oven, one hundred eight degrees for half an hour to crisp up gold.
just a few, very simple piece lucky.
it smells amazing, it 's our shepherds pie with a dash of liam, pairings sorted, math is good or that is good.
it is family famous for if you want to go at home, then click below for the full recipe.
