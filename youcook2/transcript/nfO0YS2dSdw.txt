hello , this is chef john from food wishes, dot com, with bay scallop, chowder that 's right.
i was in the mood for a little seafood literally and not only are bay scallops.
one of the smallest seafood options at the store there.
also , one of the most delicious and extremely easy to cook especially in a recipe like this.
but anyway this came out incredibly well, my only complaint i pretty much hated how it looked.
but anyway, we 'll get into that later in the meantime, we 're going to start with one of my favorite first steps of all time cooking bacon.
so going to put a heavy duty skillet on medium heat yeah, valve oil in there are going to go ahead and cook a couple strips of bacon that we 've sliced in pieces.
and we 're pretty much going to cook this bacon all the way.
we do n't necessarily need it crispy.
but we do want most of that fat rendered out and for some fairly significant carbonization, it happen which is what we have right about here at that point.
we 're going to throw in some diced onion good that esterin will sate that for.
i do n't know three or four minutes, maybe five.
until those onions soften and kind of get a little bit.
and by the way, do n't worry bout thrown in a pinch of salt like we usually do?
are going to be really careful with saltness recipe and the bacon does have enough salt in it to draw a little bit of moisture, out of those onions, which should be enough to deglaze that baking goodness from the bottom of the pan and then once are onions look good?
we 're going to go ahead, and toss in a little bit of diced, celery and a couple cloves of minced garlic, and will stir that in and we 'll just cook that for like a minute, as usual.
we do n't want that garlic to brown.
so will stir that in and saute that, for just a minute at which point we 're gonna add are liquid and we 're going to use two kinds will actually three.
but two for now, i 'm going to dump in some clam juice and also a little bit of chicken broth and ideally that 's unsalted chicken broth or low sodium.
because i mentioned earlier being careful about this salt the bacon has solved clam juice is generally kind of salty.
because we do want this december, and while we 're waiting.
let 's go ahead and stir in a cubed potato.
and i 'm going to use a uconn gold.
i love the texture for me.
it 's the perfect soup or chowder potato, and usually i like the color, although ironically the color sort of added to the problems.
i had later regarding this dish, being sort of aesthetically challenged today.
we 're going to turn those potatoes like i said, we want to bring this up to a simmer and will definitely be adjusting our final seasonings later.
but i 'm going to put a little pinch of freshly ground black pepper in here in a little pinch of cayenne, and once his mixture does start to simmer, go ahead and back your heat down to.
medium , maybe medium low would just want to maintain a nice gentle simmer until those potatoes are just about cooked.
and we do n't need him falling apart at this stage.
they still can be a little firm.
we just do n't want crunchy and by the way because scallops have that rich sweet flavor.
i want the liquid in this child to be more broadly than thick.
but if you do dash some of those potatoes and you 'll see that will significantly thickened things up.
but anyway, the viscosity is up to you, you are the boss of what i do n't want to seem like a sauce and at that point i 'm going to add one finely, diced red fresno chile, so, yes, i do like my bay.
scallop , chowder, like i like my, well, basically everything else with a little bit of spice to it and at this point.
we 're also going to throw in a big splash of cream and will stir that in.
and then we 're going to do is summer that mixture for another maybe five or six minutes until the cream reduces just a hair.
and those potatoes are perfectly, perfectly tender so it might look like when it got to that stage.
we could also at this point given a little check for salt like i said we have n't added any yet.
so if you need to add a little pinch here.
go ahead and then before we had our scale up.
so i 'm going to add one more thing a little fresh lemon zest in fact, we get that question a lot when do you zest.
when do use juice?
when do use both OK when we want to limit flavor.
but we do n't want the acidity of the juice that 's when you just use the zest and on the other hand, when we 're looking, mostly for a hida vicinity, with maybe a little bit of lemon flavor we go for juice.
but anyway, will turn some lemon zest and at that point we 're pretty much ready for bay, scallops you buy those frozen?
and you saw them.
and they should pretty much look like this, but if there 's a little bit of that milky liquid in the bowl that 's fine.
as long as these are wild caught with no additives or preservatives, brines.
then you 're good to go, and that 's what i have here, and you 're going to store those in and like i said, it 's only going to take a minute or two for these to cook and i believe i was on medium heat here.
but if you feel like you need to crank it up a little bit go ahead basically as soon as they go from that raw sort of translucent look to more of a white color that 's pretty much it they will feel just a little spring under the spooner finger and as soon as that happens, you 're done, you have to turn off the heat and serve these OK, if you cook any kind of scales too long, they will turn into small chewy, rubbery nuggets that quite frankly, no one will enjoy.
so soon as you think yours are good turn off the heat, and then before we serve this am minister, and some fresh air, again.
i think that sweet or basis flavors incredibly important to this dish there again and as soon as that 's mixed in, and we 've tasted for final seasoning or ready to serve up and up to this point.
i was so happy.
it was smelling amazing.
it was tasting amazing.
but as soon as i ladled it into the bowl and garnish with a little extra terragen i realized i did n't like how this looked it.
just look kinda, dingy to me.
because we cook that bacon and onion, first, this mixture was n't even close to your more traditional white chowder colors, and when you combine that with the green from the celery and the gold from the potato i just did not find this to have a very appetizing color this, uh, this told me, i was overreacting that it did n't look that bad.
but of course, i knew them and when it comes to food, do n't believe anything friends or family tell ya.
but anyway above and beyond is questionable , appearance.
this was absolutely delicious.
those bay scallops are so sweet and tender, especially when you only cook him briefly and forget about the scale, up anytime.
you 're eating bacon and potatoes.
that 's usually a good experience.
so , although i was extremely happy with this, except for like i said, i 'd love to figure out how to make it more beautiful and by the way, if you 're saying, it might help if you sear the scallops first free, and if you read the blog post, you 'll hear my theory why.
but anyway there you go fresh bay scallop, chowder.
so if you 're a fan of clam chowder and or bay scallops i really hope you give this a try soon.
so head over to food wishes, dot com for all the ingredient amounts and more info is usual, and as always enjoy.
