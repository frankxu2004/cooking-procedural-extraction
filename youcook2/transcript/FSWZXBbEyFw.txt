hey guys today i 'm going to show you how to make a grilled chicken caesar salad from scratch.
so some of my favorite recipes or suggestions that come from all of you.
so this recipe is going out to bubble puff one, oh nine you wanted to know how to make a classic caesar.
and i 'm going to show you how to do it so the first thing we 're going to do is create the marinade for chicken in a dish.
you 're going to combine some olive oil.
some garlic, lemon zest italian seasoning and salt and pepper with that.
all up just until combined.
and then you 're going to add your boneless, skinless chicken breasts, make sure it 's marinated on all side.
so that the chicken is well coated are they going to cover an pop in the fridge and meanwhile, we 're going to create our croutons.
now if you ask me, the croutons are the mark of any great caesar salad.
so it definitely pays to make them from scratch, do n't go out and buy the croutons thinking, you 're going to save a step 'cause it will not be as good, and when i show you how easy it is to make homemade croutons.
you 'll never go back to the stuff in a box.
now , when it comes to homemade croutons.
i really like to use tabata bread that 's because if you slice into it you 'll see it.
has all of those nooks and, crannies and that 's where all of your delicious homemade caesar salad dressing and so?
it 's a really great bread to use for something like this.
but if you ca n't find it, you could also use a baguette or french loaf that would work as well.
you 're going to slice the bread into about one inch cubes pop it in a bowl and to that, you 're going to add some olive oil minced garlic and salt and pepper.
mix it all together and then turn it out on a cookie sheet.
you then are going to bake at three seventy five for about fifteen minutes.
you 're looking for the croutons to crisp up and turn.
golden brown, now for the dressing now a classic caesar salad typically does have raw egg in it and i know that, that can make some people uneasy.
so , instead we 're going to use the mayonnaise, which is pasteurized, so there 's no reason to worry.
then , we 're going to add the zest of one lemon, and some lemon juice go ahead and give that a good whisk.
and then it 's time for the anchovies now.
i know anchovies is another controversial subject when it comes to caesar salad.
because a real traditionalists will say it is not a caesar without the anchovies.
but i know that anchovies can also make people uneasy.
so what i like to do is instead of taking real anchovies and smashing them up.
i go right to the paste.
because then you tend to not even think about it when you measure out the anchovy paste, just think of it as a nice flavorful paste.
then you 're going to add some worcestershire sauce.
add some olive oil.
whisk it all together until combined.
and then the final step is to add about a half a cup of grated parmesan cheese and that 's it.
you 're dressing is done at this point, your chicken is probably done marinating, and it 's time to grill it.
so go ahead and grill the chicken on all sides once it 's done, remove it and let it rest for about five minutes that will help retain all the juices into the chick in and make sure that your chicken does n't dry out.
so a classic caesar salad is made with romaine lettuce i love romaine lettuce.
because it has wonderful crunch to it and the leaves are.
so big and beautiful.
so much so that i do n't even like to cut it i like to serve the leaves hole on the plate and let each person cut the letters, themselves, you have a really beautiful presentation to our lettuce, leaves, we 're going to add are croutons in our dressing give that all a good toss making sure that all the leaves in croutons are covered and then what i like to do is portion that out on to plates and then at our chicken and one other little thing that i like to add, which is not traditional at all.
but it 's something that my mother loves in a caesar salad, she had it at a restaurant once and ever since then i 've been throwing them into caesar salads and that some roasted pine nuts it 's really delicious, and add one more texture to your salad, then you 're going to finish the whole thing off with some more thirties and some freshly cracked pepper and there you have it a whole made grilled chicken, caesar salads that will rival any you 'll be able to order in a restaurant i frost give this one a try and let me know what you think and keep those requests coming i love hearing from you guys.
and , if i know how to make it, i 'll definitely share the recipe.
i 'll see you next time.
