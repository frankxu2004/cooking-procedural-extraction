hi , my name is andrew perm, and the author of the award winning a black pudding and flower.
i think the bad footing represents the locals.
if you like in the regular becomes a star in for a pint of the program, may be there slightly more luxurious element?
the lords, ladies and even royalty that visited this tiring so now i 'm going to demonstrate the world famous star in blackwood, infograph.
we 've got here is the english pudding quite a deep flavor, which tend to work very well with the photograph just gently.
fridays off in here couple of slices pet the progra.
i 'm just going to slice through here by the centimeter, so there.
nice rich buttery color little bit of seasoning to wear the black puddings cooking progress the plate.
this is the screen production made with the sample for cider here.
but there 's only chest.
so very much like a sweet and sour sort of a syrup, basically, depending on how many pints, or not we had last night will depend on the circle of life, then here what 's an apple and vanilla tonight.
sweet and sour sort of effect with this grumpy and then the chutney working against each other from our garden outside little garden time is what we do in our spare time, up north.
the flower arranging pickering, wordpress, which we use for the little salad, which were placed in the center of the plate.
so , lovely peppery flavor full of vitamins, little bit of our stressing onto it, sitting in the middle as grown by eric and mew smith diana willodean, which is near pickering split the black pudding over dog snout apples out in our kitchen garden, two or three of these, ca n't get much fresher than that.
i think plug walk and go ahead.
and while that 's cooking, and do a slice of apple sorta sprinkle little bit of caster sugar, blowtorch, ready, ready, so creating a sandwich.
basically it 's nicer apple under here and away.
we , go then sit in monta under there, there.
you go so good.
somebody wrote a book about it.
the reason, i wrote the book really was to portray the people.
the place the passion of the whole region and the projects at which surrounds us and having such a brilliant pantry of food on our doorstep is exactly what i 've tried to put into the book.
i hope you enjoy the book would be likely that much you can always come down and see is all in our little part of french area around the star in her.
