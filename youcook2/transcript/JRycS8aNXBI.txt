hi , everyone, welcome to the story of packing that coffee today, we 're going to make kimchi korean kimchi.
really nice really easy.
this is not regular, one.
but very, very similar to the classical one, so hope you enjoyed the idea and stay tuned, take napa cabbage.
this is about three and a half pounds of cabbage and cut it in the middle, yeah, very important that you make sure that this part is very clean, and out of any color discoloration, if not cut it through it and cut it very thinly like.
so like i 'm look at another house and this part, i will cut to three parts.
i wanted very similar.
like so try to cut through the middle that it will hold on together.
do the same for the rest of the kids after you pre cut all the cabbage wash it very thoroughly in very cold would this is diakon radish and kira this is about pound of diakon radish.
now my decon, radishes long and thin.
because it 's organic, you can find mostly that the other kind it 's fat and round it does n't matter which kind take dich under, addition and one pretty large carrot.
so those now you have two options you have you can slice them to the fin sticks, or you can use something like this do you see, how close and add those to the cabbage i know it 's pretty weird to do.
so but i love to do it this way i have here, three tablespoons of pink himalayan sold and cover all of them leaves insult an moshe to little bit together like.
so make sure that all the bits and pieces will be covered with salt and then leave it for hour and a half hour will be enough.
because we cut it pretty thin live and mix it in between like so, meanwhile, here i have them, they can register and the qirat?
i 'm edit instincts as you see here.
oh , sorry this is believed not belongs to hear an.
i 'm urgent, one teaspoon of himalayan, sold here as well.
mix it all together and let it stand send amount of time like you will give to stand to the napa cabbage.
it occasionally like so for this source, one tablespoon of sugar and using the organic coconut sugar, so this is dark.
one and tablespoon of sweet rice flour or glutinous rice flour.
this is just basically, basically it 's very fine.
it 's more, like rice starch than flower, and you can buy it everywhere, and it 's still a right, so it 's gluten.
free and what i 'm doing is little secret to avoid lumps couple of tablespoons here inside and mix it together with the water like soul.
you see, it 's going to be very sick and very forage like there are people that call it, call it even forage.
so bring it to a boil and mix constantly and feel it 's thickens.
and , then let it cool completely.
do you see a brought it with foil, and it started to be very sick so that it take it out of the heat, and cool, completely?
at this point, this is about our into the process and as you see it 's preaches solved him.
already , if you see here we have tons and tons of juice is coming out.
and we want it.
because if it will be a little bit to juice here it will be so go afterwards this rate will become crispy.
now i suggest gohan wash.
the salt out rings it very well, pretty, well, you know, if it 's a little bit of sort will stay not a problem do the same.
here you see.
here , you remember assaulted with, with the one teaspoon of salt and as you see, here you see the juice is just real sub it, you do n't have to take all of the salt out, leave a little bit take green onion and cut them for about i do n't know, inch muscle, yeah, this goal, is another vegetable it 's a lovely, add those to the diakon radish and carrot OK, this is the source when it 's completely called you see, how thick it is.
so to the source added ten, and, i mean, at ten garlic cloves you see all of those i 'm going to grade there, and you should add ginger, this, is about two inch of ginger, you can add more or less.
but i love a lot of ginger.
so i see you after the job is done tablespoon of fish sauce you can add more or less as you like, to this add four tablespoons of chili powder you see you can add up to one cup i saw recipes it 's up to you how spicy you wanted and this is going to be pretty spicy anyways it 's quarter cup like four tables and one tablespoon i 'm aging paprika this is sweet paprika agent get just for the colour.
because it 's bright orange i want everything to be very bright and orange so.
now mix all together it 's dark it 's brownish in color.
but it 's like it 's bloody brown is amazing.
so this edge to your vegetables and mix everything very, very, very well, it smells phenomenal mix.
all together, and this is going to be based.
our kimchi, too, long amazing no cover, all the leaves one by one with this vegetable some source like so you see i have here.
let 's say this part.
so i 'm thinking there.
this , with my hands and just covering everything inside and out, and this way all the parts will get the source from kimchi, then.
next and so on and.
so forth, i know, transfer, your key machine to glass or plastic container, and let it stand outside for twenty four forty eight hours.
now my house is very hot.
so twenty four hours will be OK and then i will take it inside the refrigerator if your house is cold and you can take it up to forty eight hours, and it will be much sour if there is the world you can start to eat it.
now by the way, it 's pretty good now, already, and do n't forget to pop the lid on its very important for the fermentation process.
this is forty eight hours later and let 's try it spicy.
i love all the vegetables inside it 's not overly spicy.
social love spicier and more cheerful short.
so i hope you enjoy the idea and do n't forget to describe recommend.
common stocks are playing machines.
