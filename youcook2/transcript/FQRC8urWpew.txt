how many folks, how 's it going at.
welcome to my virgin kitchen, is barry here today?
i 'm showing you how to make an easy meatball, goulash is smells, so, so good, an the ingredients are minimal.
you 're going to absolutely love this, a hit pause in a video now.
write them all down.
this is how we do it.
is so, so good?
so , the first step is actually cooking up our meatballs now.
these are some frozen meatballs that i got from sainsburys there, but there 's nothing stopping you.
i 'm making your own from freshman, either.
cooking them straight away or put them in the freezer for a later date and obviously hopefully making this recipe, so wack them into an unproved dish.
i bet my life around route twenty two minutes gas mark six or equivalent, which i put on the screen right there, anyway, it 's time to move on with some other steps.
oh , yeah, so over a medium flame, walk down a frying pan and adding a tablespoon of olive oil.
then follow up by tipping in your chopped onions now.
those are frozen chopped onions.
you want to soften them up for around about five minutes until that all translucent.
and like lushen smell good in the kitchen, initially and then we 're going to add some more flavor in there, so, i added in some frozen chopped garlic, and also some paprika.
now staring up through will stay in it and make it look inside sun bed.
but we 're really add some decent flavor in there.
now i need to tell you about that garlic that i was using.
i 've got these pots today.
this is froze possibly, but the garlic in the onions also came in pots like this.
is so good?
particularly , onions and garlic as he can sort of snap them off and then sort of black.
once you 're done no wastage back in the freezer for another day.
and also with the onions and garlic particularly no smelly fingers, new cry and all that stuff.
but anyhow what we want to do is add in your tomatoes tin of chopped tomatoes and three hundred milliliters of water.
once that 's all in there, it was source turtle through those initial flavors start to bring it to a simmer.
but crumblin fuck you as well, get that all in there.
and again keeps throwing it through bring it to a simmer.
so , while that simmering away, and if we 're in meatballs in the oven, it 's just time to cook up your spaghetti to package instructions.
so i used some high fiber spaghetti just put that straight into my pan and then we had the spaghetti cooking away the goulash simmering away like bobbing like a coldren and of course, the meatballs two.
so once the meatballs were ready, it was time to take them out, very, very carefully lovely nice color on them and gradually add them into the pan with the thickened.
so that 's really what the state you want to simmer it too just.
so it 's thickened OK.
so get the meatballs in their stir it through, get it nice and coated then i added a bag of frozen ready chopped peppers you cena theme, here, lots of frozen stuff.
but it 's all good, we 're cooking it straight from frozen how cool is that the packers go in and then my good old parsley this is the actual table uses.
it just sprinkle it all on there.
but that 's going to chop it.
no wasted as well, you can walk that back in the freezer, get that all stirred through in there.
let it simmer all those flavors, mingle to go out for a good.
this , and once you 're ready to serve it get you spaghetti down a plate.
get some of the initial peppers and onions and garlic.
cool down first of all placed down some meatballs as well.
little bit more juice on top and if you want you can finish with a little sprinkling of oregon are so, so good.
i hope you 'll agree, that is, looking at pretty darn stocking time.
