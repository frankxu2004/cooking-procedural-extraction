higher one and welcome back to chef seeds today will be preparing steamed mussels with a coconut curry broth and these wonderful southeast asian flavors are sure to while your palate.
so must get ready for another adventure.
once again only thing we 're going to need or a few simple ingredients.
so let 's get started.
everybody the first step.
and i think the most important step is cleaning our muscles, make sure that all her muscles are closed an if there are any open muscles in there just tap on together, and if they wo n't close just discard immediately, that means are dead after that.
make sure we give him a very good race ransom and shake him up a little bit.
make sure all that third and rick and out of AM and do this process about three or four times until the water sucks run very clear you see, i just shake him much more together massage him together, well, is this gonna suck in this water, this going to spit it out.
here we go carefully inspect each one.
also , you do n't want to have one bad muscle, ruin, your entire back after repeating this process stuff three times until the water starts run.
clearly , strain am in refrigerator until ready to cook, then we can start preparing are onions for slicing not sure onions.
we could say some of our shallots, nice and thin slices followed by slicing some more garlic as well, in the meantime.
let 's start heating up a pan over a medium high heat.
so we can get ready to saute or aromatics with her muscles now, that we have this ready.
we could just pop it in little bit of oil in a pan not too much and this is going to be a very, very quick cooking procedure and that 's also one of my favorite parts about having muscles that it 's a very quick.
so i pay of our aromatics by a very quick steaming of our muscles and just a wonderful dish sets prepared in almost minutes.
it 's OK to get a little bit of color under aromatics.
the conversation is going to help in the flavor and actually enhance the flavor of this dish at this point is time for us to add or rake, rake case.
it 's very important that we sought paid promise a moment just to allow the spices to come back alive and.
so make sure we do this over high heat cooking stern quite often no, it 's all heating up all sisters.
you 're going to be able to smell all these different spices and aromatics coming up, it 's smoke wonderful, but i go for a few hours.
this is all real time everybody so do n't have to worry about how long it actually takes, no had a little bit of our fish sauce.
this has quite a pungent nose to it.
so , do n't be alarmed?
it 's actually very friendly flavor when it 's balanced with a coconut milk.
yeah , stair eating together, and we 're just gonna bring this up to a quick boil and bring it down maybe by a third.
so it 's going to concentrate in flavor.
see how it still little loose right now, well, i 'm going to bring it down.
it 's going to tighten up after we had the muscles to the pan.
all the juice of the muscles are going to infuse into this, as well, does n't really get much better.
are you watching your coconut milk produced?
you could see the bubbles disorder.
i get different thicker.
although bubbles and you could see the lines when we start how it separates see the little space in between is getting thicker or sauce.
let 's just add her muscles in after the muscles in your easter, anything this covered with a lid this process apply again.
take us no more than two minutes in the meantime.
because are picking herbs.
now take her in cilantro pretty much go hand in hand with each other, so, of course, i 'm going to have to finish this dish with some fresh cilantro now.
this cilantro is very delicate.
it 's also OK, if we had a little bit of the stem to this dish.
because we 're going to cook it down very delicately.
so it 's OK, if you do n't rip off all your stems, you know, in thailand.
they actually use the stems for sauce, so feel free to use a little bit of stem.
so after about a minute of only being covered up, and steaming away look at this they 're all opening up already, so just give them a little shuffle.
mix them up a touch.
make sure there 's no open guys, left all that flavor, it 's all marinade and infused into it do n't you just toss.
are herbs right on top?
let that wilt down well.
let me just grab that pan and run away.
i want to eat it now, see.
i think your sauce is getting as well now.
it has a coconut curry.
the mussel broth infused into it.
we are really going to enjoy this one now.
the moon we all been waiting for clean up time.
so i just said simply, i just spoon it right onto the bagel bowl that we 're going to serve it in sauce muscle, cilantro of it piled on top of each other, muscles are a finger through.
there 's no reason i get overly fancy when it comes into playing muscles, top all these guys up right on top of each other.
i like nice and high maybe a little bit more fresh cilantro dressing on top let 's turn it to give you a better view there.
you go, and a squeeze of fresh lime.
juice has a finishing touch just to highlight this dish, so there, we have it every one muscles with a curry coconut broth.
i hope you really like it, hope you enjoy it.
