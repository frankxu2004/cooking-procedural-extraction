i am running d'agostino on the editor of the new cookbook from esquire magazine like a man.
this is pretty much the only cookbook a man will ever need today.
i 'm going to be making one of the recipes from the book is fantastic meatloaf from chef michael simon who.
in addition to being an iron chef also runs two of my favorite restaurants in america and lola, bistro and lolita in cleveland, having this book is like having some of the greatest threats in the world right here in your kitchen cooking with you.
so there should be easy good luck well, it 's a really easy recipe i think god, stuff with red onion.
she 's closer garlic and chop up some cilantro that we 're going to add in later each chef include some sort of technique or trick with their recipe and, as you learn them eventually.
you build up your skill set, and you can put whatever you want.
so next thing we 're going to do is saute the onions and garlic and a little bit of butter cookies, about five to seven minutes, until they 're softened kind of translucent.
so next we 're going to let the onions in the garlic cool down.
and they were going to put everything else in a big bowl.
and so much at all together i got some nice hot italian sausage from ground beef going to be two edge together and add those in.
and then just some japanese bread crumbs and chop cilantro, then will add the cooled off onions and garlic little salt little pepper, so this is the fun part.
another thing we have in this book is essays with short pieces of writing from esquires.
amazing writers that it just meant this sort of inspire you to get in the kitchen and cook.
but everything is all mixed together.
and you ca n't see the bread crumbs anymore.
you take the whole mixture and you pack it into a meatloaf pan, or you can just make it into a shape that looks like a meatloaf and put it on a baking sheet into the oven.
it goes three seventy five for forty minutes, you could n't screw it up.
it 's fantastic like a man.
