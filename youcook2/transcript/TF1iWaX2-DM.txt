all right, we 're going to make some onion rings.
here 's an egg, put that in there, and we need one tablespoon of vegetable oil.
any one teaspoon of salt.
one eighth teaspoon, cayenne pepper, need some baking powder, one teaspoon, and you want to beat this vague up alrighty.
we need some beer.
we 're going to use at least a couple, the beer probably about a cup and a quarter and.
next we 're going to add cornmeal one quarter cup of cornmeal.
you do n't have to use that if you do n't have it, but it 's better with it and one cup of flour and mix this up.
if you think the batter is too thick which i think it is add a little more beer you want it to be kind of like pancake batter.
little bit thicker slightly thicker just slightly but very close to pancake batter and just mixes up.
i like to, i mean, the reason that more then cover it with plastic crap.
and i like to let it sit overnight before i use it just out in the open and not refrigerated or anything kind of.
let it permanent.
so we 're going to let this sit.
i do n't have overnight to do this.
i 'm going to do this today so it 's going to sit for at least an hour and also just a side note.
i usually use this to make onion rings with this is just add water with this.
and this is why i usually use but homemade true homemade onion rings.
now you have my recipe here.
i have a big onion.
here 's my hand.
here 's my hand.
here 's the onion.
i like to buy big onions whenever i make onion rings, and i 'm just going to like this up.
and then i take the peel off.
i get that the outer ring off throw that away all the peel away, and then just separate into rings.
and mary ago, OK my battery is ready.
it 's fairly thick.
i 'm going to add onions in there goes in there.
drop him one at a time into the oil.
the hot oil we 're going to have onion rings.
the , the rings of pride, about three or four minutes, you look good.
these are really excellent.
just put him on paper towels to drain.
let it cool off for like a minute or two mary ago.
