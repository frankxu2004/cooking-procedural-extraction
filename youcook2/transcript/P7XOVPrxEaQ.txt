so that he had welcome to hot thai kitchen.
today , we are going to make green curry fried rice.
i know like it 's like two really good dishes, rolled into one.
and it is as good as it sounds.
so this dish and ties called cow pop gang kill one call pat.
is fried rice and gank here?
one is the name for the curry.
it 's not super common.
but i 've seen it done.
and so it 's not like my original idea.
i wish it was super good.
and it 's going to be really quick, really easy.
it 's a great dishes, just sort of curry paste sitting in the fridge and you do n't know what else to do with it, it 's a great weeknight dinner.
so let 's take a look at our ingredients.
so the first jungle ingredients going to look very much like a green curry ingredient i 've got some green curry paste this one is just store bought and you can use more or less amusing two tablespoons the more you use the spicier will be, i 've got a little bit of sugar to cut the salt i 've got some fish sauce and the fish sauce it is going to depend how salty your curry paste it like saving with curry pace with store bought curry paste always, always leave room for adjustment for your fish sauce.
because sometimes it 's very salty, and you do n't need to add any.
and sometimes just need to add a little bit more, and then we 've got some coconut milk just to give it some creaminess and lubrication.
we 've got some thai basil.
and we 've got some really fine julie and kefir lime, leaves right here.
and that 's going to be the citrusy component that 's going to brighten everything up.
so that everything that goes into the regular green curry you can also use palm sugar.
if you wanted to so moving on vegetables, vegetables here.
i 've got one cup of really whatever vegetables you want, like it changes every time i make it depending on what i have, i 've got some carrots bell peppers some onion and some dalan or chinese broccoli and i slice the stems dimly in the leafs i just kind of shifa nodded and.
so you can use peas would be really great.
long beans cut up would be really good.
as long as there 's thirty, they 're not going to wilton, look funny, and anything that you would like in a fried rice, you could totally do that just a combined, total volume of one cup is perfect.
so that 's that and then our protein.
i 've got i 'm using chicken breasts here.
you can use pork beef tofu, whatever you can even do eggs if you wanted to this into small pieces.
you want the pieces that chick into comfortably fit on to your spoon, along with the rice do n't do.
big honkin piece of chicken that 's just it 's not a practical fried rice size, so i 'm just going to marinate it in my soy sauce.
just a teaspoon or so, all the details of the recipe is on my website, if you want measurements and everything that 's all there.
so just some soy sauce.
and i 'm also going to put a little bit of vegetable oil.
i think it helps keep things moist.
and also when you add it to the pan it helps the chickens spread easier, so they 're not sticking together into a clump.
so we 're going to let that go you can do this ahead of time.
but what i usually do is i do this before i start cutting my vegetables and by the time i 'm ready to cook, then it will be ready to go.
so there 's that and then finally, first the rice.
so i 've got some three hundred grams of rice here in my pineapple fried rice episode.
i talked about five tips for cooking rice specifically for fried rice.
if you 've got leftover rice that 's great in this dish is particularly important that your rice was not cooked with too much water, and it 's not too soft.
because there is coconut.
milk so are fried rice sauce is going to be a little bit wetter than normal so something to think about if the rice is already on the verge of being.
soft it might get a little mushy.
and also just put it in the fridge and let it dry out a little bit and then the coconut milk will rehydrate it perfectly.
so that 's all our ingredients.
let 's get cooking alright.
we 're ready to cook.
i 've got my walk here.
i 'm going to heat it on just sort of medium heat.
when you saute curry paste, you do not want to start it in too hot of a pen because you can burn the curry paste instantly.
you think about it curry paste is just herbs that i 'm tiny, tiny pieces so they can burn easily.
so just a little bit of vegetable oil in there, going to go in with my curry paste.
i 'm not going to wait for the oil to heat up because it 's OK for the curry paste is slowly heat, heat control for me.
so this is my first time cooking in a wok with this new portable stove that i 've got so be very interested to see how it goes.
might be a little hard for me to sort of just the heat settings will see OK, so i 've got that spot paying cook that just for.
wow it 's pretty powerful just for a few minutes just to get all the earth hooked up and then i 'm going to go in with the.
coconut , milk message, calm it down a little spoof.
wow chili 's oh, by the way did i tell you this, this is spicy.
it is some sugar.
my fish sauce i 'm starting with just a teaspoon going to cook that i 'm going to reduce the curry paste down a little bit.
so we do n't have too much liquid something like this is looking good, 'cause if you got too much liquid, you add the rice and the rice is going to get too wet, too mushy.
so i 'm going to.
now add my chick in let the chicken cook, briefly my camera man is having a cuffing situation that chili 's pretty strong.
i 'm going to go in with my vegetables, all my vegetables.
micro , fear lime leaves, and cook that up just until the chickens about seventy percent, done so it 's all about timing in this dish.
it 's all about swimming.
yes , so a lot of people think when your stir frying walk the heat needs to be extremely high.
that 's not always the case in some cases like pot CU and things like that.
you want the heat to be as high as you can go.
but for some things like this when you 're involving, curry paste and coconut milk and things that can burn you do not necessarily want to cook it on high heat.
my chick in is mostly done got a little bit to go.
so good so at this point if you have if you 're cooking this for the first time you want to give it a taste.
and then it 's just your saltiness with more fish sauce, and you can add a little sugar.
i 've done this before, so, i know that i need a teaspoon.
and that should do it but if it 's your first.
time , you definitely want to give it a paste at this point.
and that 's it.
we 're done and now all we have to do i forgot my thai basil.
i knew it was it felt a little strange thai basil.
you want to turn off your heat first.
then you toss in the thai basil.
because you do n't want to cook with high base over too long into intensiva heat or they will turn black and not very nice, looking with that smell.
let 's go, played it up.
so this service about two perfect amount for a couple there.
you go look how nice it looks.
so when you choose vegetables you want to make sure you 've got all the good colors in there.
you want some red.
some green wait.
the edges of my flight a little, OK.
it 's eating time.
i can smell the.
spice , this is going to be spicy, oh, yeah, that 's good if you need a kick in the butt.
if you 've been eating bland food, and you just sick of bland food.
this is it.
this is it right here is going to like brighten up your world.
it 's a lot to earth, you can really taste the computer line leaves, and basil coming through, and it 's.
