welcome to LA cucina anna maria.
i 'm anna maria defreitas, owner of the harrison house suites tucker house in and coho, restaurant in friday harbor san juan island.
here i am in pelindaba lavender fields.
pelland , abba is the premier manufacturer of lavender and lavender products here on salmon island, and probably throughout the nation today.
i 'm going to demonstrate how to make a traditional lamb.
shish , kabob also infused with lavender.
so i 'm going to start with some oregano, you could use fresh or ground some freshly ground khuman and some culinary lavender.
if you look to my left, you will see the green rose.
that 's the culinary lavender.
it 's been harvested probably about three weeks ago.
and then the buds are dried, and i will use that as part of this marinate lavender is a great herb that works well, with lamb.
i think about using lavender any place that i would use rosemary.
so i 'm just going to grind this up and pulverize it, and you can see that the buds are.
now turning to fibers a few more turns OK and will add teaspoon of that.
and i have some smoky, paprika will add that to the bow anne.
i pinch a white pepper and some garlic cloves.
i 've just lightly diced them and chop them up good pinch of salt and just a little bit of olive oil to hold everything together give it a stir.
can i have some local lamb here that i 've just cubed going to put this in the rub?
these are great.
kabob served little tizzy key and some grilled flatbread, but this sit overnight, or, you can just get ready to grill them.
i have some lavender girl sticks.
you can see they use everything at the plant.
so after they harvested, harvested buds, whatever is left the sticks are great for kebabs, you can also use them for smoking.
so i 'm going to thread the lamb on here these will be getting ready for the grill.
sometimes the grill sticks work a little easier for something that 's not so quite aspirus is lamb great for chick in perfect for scallops shrimp.
then just imparts a nice flavor.
these are ready for the barbeque.
i hope you enjoy your traditional lamb shish, kabobs, bona, petite.
