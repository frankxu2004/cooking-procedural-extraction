just give us a bit at the package and bash me, barber used to buy bagaza bash.
my mother never made bangers and mash she made me known backup light version with godawful pry.
but this is far superior from the UK, it, with some red onions, an, an some star annise just to boost some of those meaty flavors and here you see, i 'm just using a skillet pan do n't if you do n't use, a nonstick pan.
because you wo n't get that farmed if you can see that collection of flavor in the base of the pan, which i just continually deglaze, let that water evaporate.
and then let that fun build up again and then add water again and repeat that process about three or four times then i just add some garlic and cook that off about thirty seconds.
and then, i add some flour and cook that off for about two minutes, then i had a load of water and then i kind of go a little bit crazy with the ingredients.
i add quite a lot.
i just really wanted to showcase some of the ingredients that you can put into such a gravy assets and chicken stock.
some tabasco, some H P source not, not a lot of any of these ingredients just tiny amounts.
some are made, that is, a really great flavor booster.
some bailey, if someone is the chester shire sauce, some pepper, and i would n't, would n't say you have to add all of these ingredients?
but it really was a fantastic gravy.
some bus samic and some catch up and these all thicken the gravy as well, so you do n't need to add as much flour.
and you 'll still get quite a nice thick gravy, and then i take out the bay leaves an.
i add in some rosemary and some sage and then i just turn off the heat.
and i want to cook those herbs aggressively.
there are just browning off the sausages, and now i 'm going to make my mash.
i 've boiled some potatoes.
i may i put some milk and some butter in the pan, and some mustard, some horseradish, some pepper.
and then i 'm i rise my potatoes.
i find that this gives them gives you a much smoother mash than using a potato masher, and they 'll add some parmesan.
i just tried that out because i saw nigel slater doing that once.
and i thought i 'd try it out.
add a bit more milk, because it was n't very it was a bit too thick.
and here it will it needed sees name, and i always look is there anything i can use over, then just salt to season my food, and in this case, i thought celery salt would work quite well, and it did.
and there you go there.
it is there.
it is lovely.
delicious , really good bye, bye.
