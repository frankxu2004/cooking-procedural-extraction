hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with cheater, perogy that 's right.
i was sitting around thinking how can i make my polish grandmother roll over in her grave and then it came to me make this recipe.
so all this is far from authentic, it is very proggy, like and very tasty.
so here 's how you make it so we 're going to boil some potatoes for the filling.
i have some uconn gold.
of course, i salted the water were going to cook those until completely tender and while we 're waiting.
we 're going to take our cheese out of the fridge farmers cheese read about that on the blog post for me.
it 's kind of a cross between like cream cheese and ricotta cheese, but very delicious stuff once the potatoes are cooked, you have to drain them extremely.
well , you do n't want water in this, and then we 're going to match those, while they 're hot and they really should cool down to just warm, before we had the rest of the ingredients.
so , smash him and let him sit there for about ten minutes to cool down while you 're waiting you can season them with some salt.
some pepper some, that 's right, cayenne little bit can i highly doubt it so ten or fifteen minutes later the potatoes should be just warm.
throw in a whole leg and my farmers cheese and once that smashed together, you are done.
and by the way, program can have a million kinds of fillings.
this just happens to be my favorite.
but what i 'm showing you here today will work with almost any filling.
so , once your cheese is mixed in, in your fillings made i 'm going to go ahead and wrap that up and refrigerate it.
i find it easier to work with cold, but you do n't have to you can actually start folding your programs right now.
so the fillings done and chilling until needed that was n't really the cheater part of this recipe that feeling is actually fairly legit.
here is the cheating part that 's right, we 're using round wonton skins for our perogy dough won.
ton skins are nothing more than perfectly round perfectly.
even pieces of pasta, it 's incredibly fast and easy and again this is a cheater recipe.
so relax alright so we have are won.
ton skins, i 'm also going to need a little bit of an egg wash, which is just a beaten egg tablespoon of water.
you 're going to want to lightly flour your surface.
i 'm going to take a pastry brush or fingertip.
i 'm a fingertip guy.
go round the outside around the outside around the outside to moisten with the egg wash.
so the dough seals properly once it 's been, egg washed around the outside.
it 's time to place down your filling.
i 'm using a little sore bay, scoop it 's about two teaspoons or so, and then just simply press the edges together to seal.
if you want to go and do the little fancy crinkle fold, go ahead.
i do n't bother because once these are cooked as you 'll see, they look great, the folding it over pressing and, that is, it seriously.
it 's that easy you 're going to want to egg wash fill in.
fold a whole bunch of those, as many as you want to eat, would be my advice and then to finish?
these are simply boiled for two minutes in boiling salted water.
and then they can be finished in any number of ways, you can cook him in a little bit of butter that 's probably my favorite way or is going to show you.
now in bacon and onions, which takes it up A notch.
some bacon and some onions in a little bit of butter that 's right.
we 're cooking bacon in butter.
i 'm using medium heat.
and i 'm going to cook the onions in the bacon together, and the bacon fat is going to render.
and it 's going to brown the onions beautifully, and when your bacon is crisp, as you want, and your onions are nice and carmalized, i 'm going to push those off to one side, and i 'm going to evaluate how much fat.
i think i have just about the right amount.
of course, if it 's too much use, the old paper towel trick come up and if it looks like you need more, throwing another little chunk of butter.
i 'm ready to place in my just boil perogy, and of course, you 're doing both, these things.
simultaneously , you have your panna, fixings next to the boiling pot.
so when your program you 're done, you 're transferring them right into the frying pan.
it 's perfect system.
i 'm going to drown those lightly for a minute or two on each side.
i 'm going to toss it with bacon and onions.
you do n't have to go crazy with the portion sizes.
five is plenty.
so in a place is on a plate, a nice dollop of sour cream very traditional, you can top that with some fresh dill or fresh chive.
and that 's it totally fake way, way, way, way faster, and easier.
perogy , and talk about a textural tango in your mouth.
you got that crispy, buttery crust.
and inside you have that soft luscious potato farmer cheese mixture just magnificent, anyway, there you go cheater, perogy sorry grandma.
but i had to do it, make the dough from scratch, it is better, but having said that these were super delicious and something.
i hope you try especially if you 've never had program before considered this like training program.
so i hope you check these out, head over to food wishes, dot com for all the ingredient amounts and more info is usual, and as oeis enjoy.
