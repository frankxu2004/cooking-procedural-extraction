thomas , and it 's so interesting that it 's all the trend today.
and when i was a kid in my mom would take homeless in use that, instead of mayo on our sandwiches.
and we packed those in a brown bag for lunch and the other kids would ask me what i was eating 'cause it smells so great.
i 'd be real, embarrassed.
and i 'd say lebanese mayonnaise.
but you know, what we have really come full circle hummus is probably one of the best things you can eat and it 's very expensive in the delis or at the grocery i 'm going to show you how to make your own an old family recipe that 's delicious, and really easy, you want to start off with a can of chick peace, sometimes called cici beans, garbanzo beans, full of calcium.
any bean is really good, helps, pull cholesterol out of your body.
all i do is drain them.
you do n't need to rinse them.
now you can do this by hand like my mom used to do, but i 'm going to do it in a food processor because very smooth.
but you can get smoother, as chunky as you want, and to that you 're going to add a teaspoon of minced garlic.
oh , that smell.
so good more or less remember this is to your taste now.
garlic is good for your heart.
so i made a little more than a teaspoon and a fourth a cup of lemon juice and, you know, you can freeze lemons let me tell you a great trick when you buy lemons in the store and if there ever on sale take your lemon, whole unpeeled like this, put it in the freezer let freeze it hard uncovered, when it 's frozen.
hard you 've got a frozen lemon.
the great thing is thought out, and it will exude.
so much juice.
because the cellular structure has broken down in the freezer just like tomatoes and also if you 're going to zest that frozen lemon zest it before, of course you cut it in half and while it 's still fairly frozen, but, that is a great way to have vitamin C all year round.
now sometimes when you buy a lemon , two.
at the store there hard, and the old fashion way, too is you roll it on the counter with the palm of your hand to start breaking that cellular structure down.
if it 's still real hard, sometimes that does n't work, well.
what you can do is poke a few holes in it like this.
take it over to the microwave in microwave.
it just a few seconds not long.
and what happens is the heat of that microwave will again soften the outside and the inside and you 'll get lots and lots of juice.
so that 's your lemon primmer for today.
so let 's continue to make our home.
you want to use about a fourth, a cup of lemon juice again more or less to taste, and.
now the secret, ingredient or really not even a secret, the key ingredient in hummus is something called tahini, not tahini is.
nothing more than sesame E seed paste.
when you get home, and you open it, store it in the fridge erator, and it 'll, it 'll keep for six seven months in there.
and sesame E seeds are full of calcium.
really , really delicious used a lot in mediterranean cooking, so you want to use anywhere.
all about three tablespoons, or so, an i will tell you that when it 's stored in the fridge what happens is the oil of the sesame E seeds.
rises to the top.
so when you take it out of the fridge stir it up otherwise, you 're just going to get sesame E seed oil, and.
now what we 're going to do.
we 're going to add a couple tablespoons of olive oil old boy was really a healthy oil.
some people do n't even add the olive oil.
but i like the flavor of it now for my two secret ingredients.
a little bit of yogurt about a fourth of a cup use.
good yogurt that gives it a little bit of a tank to my pal.
it 's really good and commune.
we call it khamoon cumin seed about a teaspoon, half a teaspoon little bit more or less to taste.
or i wish you were here that smells so good, very warming herb again use a lot in mediterranean cooking.
and we 're going to give it a grind of salt or pepper and pepper ann with justin here.
he probably would love cayenne pepper.
you could do that too, but i 'm just going to show you how quick it is now, you know, what that is done.
when i 'm going to do now is.
i 'm going to pour it in a bowl season.
it , with salt and pepper ann, we 're ready to eat.
it only took a couple not even two minutes in the food processor an if you notice, mine is chunky.
but you can make it smooth as you want just by continuing to process it more, and some people do this in the blender, as well now, i say, the only downside to hamus is the color 'cause it 's sort of brownish.
so what we 're going to do is we 're going to gussy it up a little bit with some fresh parsley and sometimes let me do this too at home what i 'll do, is right before i serve it drizzled again with some extra virgin or pure olive oil.
OK , there you go really, humason a flash.
