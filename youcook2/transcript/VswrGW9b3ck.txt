hey , everybody welcome to the wolfpit today, i 'm going to show you how to make crispy and golden fried calamari simple, easy and delicious.
so let 's get started.
i have some calamari rings here that i 've patted dry on paper towels and these are actually squid rings.
a lot of people do n't know that, that 's what they are going to simply season with salt and pepper.
and now get your hands in there and give him a toss.
now give him a good dusting of flour.
and now get your hand back in, there and give him a good mixed.
make sure they 're all well coded shake off most of the excess flour and then drop into three hundred fifty degree oil for about one minute or until lightly.
golden brown, after one minute, the calamari is lightly golden brown.
so i 'm going to go ahead and pull these out, and sprinkle with salt, and you want to be careful.
you do not want to over cook these otherwise.
they 're going to turn into rubber bands now.
continue this process until all of the calamari is lightly fried in golden brown, and there.
you have it fried calamari lightly fried until golden brown served with lemon wedges and your favorite marinara sauce.
thank you guys very much for watching.
i hope you give this a try and i 'll see you next time.
