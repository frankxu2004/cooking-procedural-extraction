and welcome, to the second ever episode of kiss, the cook.
what are we making today linda alright so explain to the people at home?
what that is, 'cause.
personally , i had never heard of it before i got here.
well , it 's just regular sausages, and you could get them that fonz usually on tuesdays, they have a new shipment is it white barrett 's favorite male.
we have a lot of wrestling people that watch this thing for some reason.
i 'm not really sure what else i need to pick up this to for the famous likes it.
and you can also get that bond and then pepper salt vinegar elsa need garlic green, buying things that are crane potatoes.
most important parts, i 'd say is the potatoes mashed oil and put 'em in a stew before we make the bangers.
where are the potatoes alternative alright?
you 're cutting those bad boys up into four is right.
yeah , of course, it 's quicker to oil.
this is boiling time now.
i 'll bring you the potatoes.
PO tay toes i fell put in a little salt for flavor and make sure that you have a pink pot that 's very important.
so , if there 's any manly people watching this make sure you have the paint pot time for some banging.
yeah , so she 's warm skillet and add about two tablespoons of butter immediately warm skillet two teaspoons of butter tablespoon.
i want spoons like the british theme shirt, though, for the bangers, uh, yeah, that 's a good thing to do another center right now.
although when i zoomed in on your shirt i bet they did n't think i was the leopard in pre.
she definitely kill the shooting for that shit anyways.
all right anytime we 're men.
that 's what we do you could just put them in as they were together and then you have to pretty much baby.
sit them because you 're browning them as they cook.
see baby sitting like chris reckless is babysitting about six pound burger spell.
at least side with cook for like five minutes, just to brown it.
this is just like before we put the brush, so you 're turning them from regular sausages to barack, obama sausages, so while that stuff is cooking.
i 'm gonna do the green bay.
and then we 're gonna take that at garlic cloves.
it always depends on how many cans.
you make of green beans that like for maybe one can for two people you would put, like, maybe two small government clubs spread 'em on the green beans there, and you do n't want too much garlic.
because it just feels too much envy, too much here right.
now i 'm sitting in the worship.
so now we 're going to add salt and make sure you add quite a bit and then next day.
and it has to be in a little flower thing.
otherwise , it 's not the same.
all right, after you get these brown, you 're gonna turn off the keys, and then i have my green beans in the microwave for a minute, i can then we 're going to add vinegar.
what kind of vinegar also make vinegar balsamic vinegar at bosses, well, now, all right.
and then you 're going to make that, or a scoop that ball sack later and then add salt mix.
it asphalt men put it in the fridge for about a half an hour alright for the gravy.
kareena add about two tablespoons per cup.
so not two spoons pick up now.
that 's the best.
i and then a couple of water gotta be hard, cups, stop killing me again now when you pour the water.
it has to be in a heart shape configure.
otherwise , again will not count.
then just add it, and then put that on low heat.
so you 're gonna cook that on low heat for about ten minutes, and you just want the gravy to thicken alright.
the potatoes are done messing up so you just mash him right now.
so it 's tough, left his took amanda stoop probably saying that wrong and look like a jacket carrie.
you 're gonna add some milk and make sure it 's expired, milk.
OK , we doing wrong alright, then you 're gonna add salt set up, then pepper, i 'm adding a lot.
because i made a lot of potatoes ever want to see something really creepy just watch.
this babe, babe, babe, we 're going to add, you know, it 's sad though, is that in this condition, right here hanging he still better wrestlemanias right.
now spoonful, butters, facebook, yeah, you wanna do like a large table, OK.
so now the bankers were done.
we 're gonna take.
amav , and put them on a plate here.
is the final product alright.
so after you let the gravy sit in the skillet about two minutes then you strain it into a bowl, and you 're going to add salt and pepper?
it 's kind of racist, though, is n't it putting a human beings into a bowl of gravy that 's very creative?
good musicians, not gonna steal see there.
do n't go chasing waterfalls make sure you taste it?
and it will taste little different, weird, but once it 's mixed with mashed potatoes and singer will be fine.
yay , there 's the final product and will be back with a taste test alright.
so we 're here to do the taste testing, i 'm going to go with mashed potatoes first.
do n't mess with the banger right mashed?
potatoes are really good there.
gonna try something.
i do n't like result, hope it 's tolerable.
i 'm not a big fan of those, though.
so it does n't matter if you made the most amazing ones on the planet X, and probably not liking so far.
i love this , love.
this , i like green beans, but the extra onto it with vinegar and everything, makes it even better.
so it comes up to that the sexual hot dogs are really good fingers.
saturday , the banging bangers, i know there is a really good actually dipping in the instead of the green beans you could add red bean like the canned beans.
in fact, that 's usually what they add.
i say overall i 'm biased towards those salim alone, but the sexual hot dogs, AKA bangers, and mash potatoes combined.
i would give it a four hour five minute fixes, and, uh, i 'm not saying this just because i 'm married to you.
but you do n't have a choice.
i love all this, and i give it a straight, bye-bye defy mohawks.
i do n't think you 'll ever not give her one.
