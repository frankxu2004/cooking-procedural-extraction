hi , friends rosie.
and in this video, i 'm going to show you how i make my stovetop, macaroni and cheese at anytime that you want the exact measurements for this recipe, visit my blog.
i heart recipes dot com.
i 'm going to start off with my elbow, macaroni pasta as you can see or if you ca n't tell.
i have some velveeta cheese that i cubed up.
you 're going to need a couple tablespoons of salted butter in this bull.
here i have some sharp cheddar cheese that i shredded up.
you 're going to need some water, and, that is not the exact measurement here.
i have some half and, half and whenever i use half and half people ask me what it is, well, this is what it says on the outside of the card, and, and if you turn it around it, says milk and cream.
those half milk half cream, if you ca n't find this in the store, you can use part, milk and part cream.
but in the span or my saucepan i 'm going to start pulling in my water and a half and half, followed by these two ingredients.
i 'm going to grab my elbow, macaroni pasta, and i 'm going to add it into the sauce pan as well, you can use regular size elbows if you want.
i 'm just going to give everything a nice little sturgis to make sure that the pastas nicely emerged into the liquid and.
now i 'm going to turn the heat up to medium, high, let it start to bubble just like that.
i 'm not going to start adding in the button.
i 'm going to let him know completely add in my velveeta cheese.
we 're going to continue to cook this mac and cheese until the pasta is nice and al.
and that means until eight is nicely cooked.
but still firm and not overcooked so once you have a cheese sauce like this, an your pasta is pretty much good to go.
you 're going to start adding in your shredded cheese.
and then you 're going to fold it in until everything is nice to combined and all that cheddar cheese is nicely melted as this is the finished look you are ready to serve.
this is so easy.
and i think it took him like minutes twenty five minutes at most.
so now i 'm going to serve it, and when i do serve this mac and cheese since it 's a really quick and easy dinner i just like to keep everything really simple.
and i usually served with a side salad and by the way, you can freeze this.
i 'd like to make a nice big batch of this, and then i eat some now and then we save the rest for later so.
yeah , definitely feel free to turn this into a freezer mail.
keep this in mind during the holidays if you 're one of those people that like to cook things in advance and just warm it up.
the day of so now i 'm just going to label my container by the way, i got them from the dollar tree.
is it thank you so much for watching?
