hey guys, i 'm scott and thanks so much for watching in a previous video, i should you guys.
how to make homemade brought worst in this recipe.
i 'm going to show you a quick and easy way to cook those brought.
worst , of course, you could have bought these at the supermarket, but why not make them fresh if i can do it, you can do it for sure.
i have one pound of homemade, brought worst here.
and i have n't this year that 's going to be able to go into the oven.
we 're going to do this in a roasted version.
so i 'm going to turn on my heat.
i 'm going to add my brought.
worst today 's recipes available in portland comfort food dot com just click on the chef 's blog and you 'll find all of my video, recipes right there.
so i had my one pound of sausages in the roasting pan i 'm going to pour in two beers just to.
cover , and then about a teaspoon of salt sea salt, of course and to this, i have one small yellow onion.
i 'm just going to put that right in on top.
i 'm going to let this mixture come up to a boil and let these sausages boil for about five minutes.
the mixture of the beer in the audience is just coming up to a boil just grab apparent tongues.
and you want to keep rotating these sausages just to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of your pan and let this boy like i said about five minutes alright.
it 's been about five minutes are sausages, are cooked essentially at this point and that 's important?
especially if you 're going to be putting these on the grill 'cause, if you were put raw sausages to under grill, they would scorch and burn on the outside before the inside is completely done.
if you 're in question grab a meat internal thermometer and test for a hundred and sixty five degrees on all of this ground sausage product today.
i 'm going to be showing you a great roasted recipe.
it 's easy for folks, who do n't have a grill.
live in an apartment, or just want to do it inside on a cold and rainy day in a large bowl.
here i have tim cloves of really large garlow, right inside of that have one large red onion sliced kind of break that up a little bit going to throw out about a teaspoon of salt and grab some time we probably want ten sprigs of thyme just thrown in there just like so.
i have four potatoes cut into about half inch pieces.
they 're going to roast quickly, and now i need to add about a teaspoon of pepper to this.
i get a lot of questions about this little spice, grinder.
check with william sonoma to peugeot spice grinder.
but they 're really handy.
OK , probably two to three tablespoons of olive oil now, we 're going to throw in our sausages.
this is just going to give me room to get everything, well, coated with oil and salt and pepper, a little straighter.
here grab all these onions, health, and i 'm going to discard the levere get everything in your bowl.
cost it well in the olive oil salt pepper and all that good stuff except altogether i 'm going back to the same cast iron dish that i was boiling sausages in this could be even a sheet pan or roasting pan or casserole dish.
whatever you have do n't, do n't sweat about it in my oven, is preheated to three hundred and seventy five degrees?
if you have a roast function on your over, you want to do that.
it just turns on the top element, occassionally us all this right into your big dish as you can see this rescue of multiplying up really, really easily.
and it can be altered if you do n't like onions, then cut down any amount of that or garlic or whatever that is.
so all entire over the past year going to put this in the oven.
approximately , an hour i 'm going to go in every twenty minutes.
and just turn everything over so we get an ice caramel color all over the top, so there.
we go are roasted brought worst right out of the oven with delicious caramel, ised onions and garlic.
all mixed in there as well as these potatoes in the star trek that really soaks up so much of this great flavor.
what i 'm doing is just go in and pulling off these little twigs that had the time leaves on it, see they all felt fell off and play radar.
dish is kind of poke around in there and get all that out, and then call folks to the table because this is ready to serve.
of course, you could put this out on a large platter and bring it to the table or have folks.
come right to the kitchen employment right out of the roasting pan.
it 's so delicious, and really nice and easy for even for weeknight dinners, i know, an hour in the oven, turning every twenty minutes it 's super simple in a good way to get dinner on the table at a quick way.
