today , i 'm going to be making a waldorf salad.
now i find solids quite boring really.
so this is brilliant.
because it 's got things like grapes and apples in which make it a really refreshing change for a salad.
so start with lettuce and make sure it 's thoroughly washed under the tap and then just slice it into chunks , OK.
so we have the letters.
and we just need to add in our celery and red grapes.
now again washy salary under the top.
i 'm just using one here and then just slice that instruments as well, and as mentioned if you feel like you need anymore.
this anymore anything just add in is desired.
i love red grapes.
so i 'm going to put in quite a few of these in as well, and i also like to just chop them in half as well, and the.
next to get an apple now.
i usually put between half an apple and a whole aplin, depending on how much letters shoes and i 'm going to use a whole one here some people like it 's be sliced quite thoroughly.
but i like it.
kind chunks, so probably divided up into eight ten pieces and then cut in chunks that.
so just making sure there 's no tips going in as well.
so another thing that makes a ward off salad waldorf salad is the walnuts.
so you probably want about hundred and fifty grams.
maybe in this bowl of salad.
so i could just sprinkle those in as well and then just drizzle of oil as well, and to combine everything together, you want to get yourself some mayonnaise and just start mixing everything together and depending on how much have you might just want to wash your hands and get your hands in there and probably going to few more grapes in there and possibly another after as well, not much happy with the quantities of everything you 've got in the salads, just make sure everything 's already combined in the mayonnaise is kind of sticking everything together how to set up more anything you want on this issue and preference.
but bunch of mixed altogether is, then ready to serve.
