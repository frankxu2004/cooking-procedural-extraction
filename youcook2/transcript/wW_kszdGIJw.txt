my guys, if you like your takeaway meals, but you want to make an extra special healthy, unmake them at home.
then this is the recipe for you.
i 'm going to show you how to make singapore noodles in so easy and best of all, you can use lots of edges and lack of your bed.
you content, so we 're going to start off with is chopping.
are veggies, but i do need to tell you that i have marinated it some chicken strips with a little bit of soy sauce?
some oyster sauce and some garlic and ginger.
and you leave that to sit while you get on with the rest of the USB.
so time to chat with my veggies are going to start with my garlic.
so nice fine shop on your garlic, and you do n't have to be too careful.
but i do like when i do like asian dishes that there 's nice color difference in texture.
so you got a little bit of fine slicing going on this stuff that 's my garlic with your ginger.
what you want to do is take off the skin.
so just run a knife around the sides of this and just grab one of these babies, if you 've never used one of these there microplane, graters, and they are absolutely fantastic for getting the most out of your ginger or chili, and i 'm going to use it for ginger.
now give this one a good great down.
i 'm using a lot of ginger because i love ginger.
an you do want to get a bit of a head of it, so about two thumb sized pieces will do the job here.
right that 's my ginger.
so job up the veggies.
spring onions, celery and carrots.
and you can use whatever veggies you want here.
peppers old regimes projects.
it 's up to you.
and now we 're joined in the kitchen by the star of the show max, the dog, everybody play maxi hey.
he 's just come because he thinks it 's food.
so i better crack on getting dinner ready rice time to get that was nice and heart, so he goes on.
now the thing when you 're making an asian dish or any stir fry is to make sure that your walk is hot and that is the biggest mistake people mess the biggest mistake people make even the reason you get a gloopy sloppy stir fry is.
because your work is not hard if it 's really hot like that you get this fiery east that really cooks it nice and quick and that 's exactly what i 'm looking for now.
so i 'm going to let that he 's off.
i 'm going to get a little drop of sunflower oil in there.
and you want to keep it heating until it just debate start smoking.
and when it starts smoking, you know, that it 's nice and hot and ready to rock we 've got that lovely marinated chicken.
and this goes straight in it does fizzle or stick with it.
you need to make sure that your walk is nice and has and as soon as that sizzle dies down.
you 've got a beautiful cooking one that is n't going to reduce innotek.
so give it a good mix.
true , right off, and you want to cook this just until that chicken is just about cooked through right come in here and check this out.
we 've got beautifully cooked chicken at this point.
so this is the way you need it to be before you transfer it out the chicken is nice and firm as cook , true.
so transfer it over to a place and get that pan straight back on the heat and another little bit of olive oil or sunflower oil or rapeseed oil in little drop goes in and.
now you need to hit it with those great flavors.
so i 'm going to start off with a little bit of the garlic, and ginger straight into the pan.
and give it a good mix through and as.
soon as those ginger and garlic pieces started the camero magic, you want to hit it with all those veggies, or if you could smell this right now, you would be making this for your dinner tonight.
try it out OK veggies go.
in pile are spring onions or celery or carrot in there.
and we 've got some bean sprouts as well, and.
now all you need to do is mix it through, in with a drop of sesame E oil for a nice naughty hiss about a teaspoon.
no more it 's quite strong.
and then some oyster sauce gives a lovely kind of rounded salty flavor.
and for both color, an saltiness, i 've got some direct soya sauce and do try and get the dark solar cells here.
because it really does make a difference to the colour and the taste is a little bit of molasses in there.
so it really depends the flavor once those veggies are nice and tender.
but they still have a bites.
the chicken goes straight back in we 're going to add in some pre, cooked noodles.
you can use rice noodles.
egg noodles, whatever you have yourself and.
now the final ingredients a little bit of curry powder.
so to get that in there and you want to add that just at the last minute little bit extra for alone makes up through.
i want to have the best utensil from to do this, hang on one seck.
we have this is the only way to mix through your noodles, so grab these babies and just get in there.
i do n't know what you call these i like to think of them as aardvark hands so, just mix through those and get your noodles completely coated.
now you do n't want to overcook it, so just wack off the heat.
all gone very quiet and calm now as soon as you turn off the heater just kind of calmed down a little bit.
so tumble this out onto a nice big serving platter look at that these are serious noodles.
you 'll never have to dial to take away again, look easy.
last sprinkle of some spring onions over the top and now as the case, it 's going to grab a fork.
this is worth waiting for have a little swirl of noodle little bit of chicken little bit of veggies give it ago a so good.
