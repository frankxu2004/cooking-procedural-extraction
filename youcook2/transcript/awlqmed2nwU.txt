many a time people say to me, monju cooking curry 's takes ages and it 's really difficult.
so i 'm going to show you how to make a quick chicken curry using a few basic ingredients and five simple spices.
here are my ingredients.
i 've got some onions chicken breasts.
the spices turmeric cumin coriander, garam, masala and chili powder.
some tomato puri, a bit of ginger, and some garlic.
so , first of all, we 're going to heat some oil up is vegetable oil for this.
once the oil is heated up, i 'm going to add my sliced onions now, you can chop your onions.
but for speed i 've just sliced them give that a quick mix and break up some of the onion pieces and separate them, if you have n't already once you 've done that add your chick in.
and i 've chopped mine into two centimeter cubes.
bite size pieces and give it another stuff.
and you fry your chick in and onions for about eight to ten minutes until the chick in turns white on the outside you must cook your chicken thoroughly for at least ten minutes.
but because i 've broken them into bite size pieces the process should be quicker.
but i 'm going to definitely give this ten minutes, and while the chicken is frying away along with the onions you tip in your garlic, which you can chop slice or crush and give it another stir.
the next stage is to mix up my spices with the tomato puri and oil and make a curry paste out of them.
so i 'm going to take them in a little bowl.
add some tomato puri and just A touch of oil and the oil eases the blending.
so just stir it all up, and as you can see here it 's a lovely thick curry paste.
the chicken is cooked on the outside as you can see, and it 's beginning to actually turn brown as well.
now i 'm going to add my lovely curry paste in it goes let the spices fry along with the chicken for about a minute and if you want to pick a source just add a touch of water about six tablespoons.
give it another stir put the heat on low and let that simmer for about five minutes.
then , you add your grated ginger.
now appealed the outer layer of the ginger.
it does n't matter if you keep the skin on.
but i 've peeled it and just great it on top.
and you can add ginger at the end of cooking, or during the cooking process that 's lovely, well, the chickens done.
it 's looking lovely and red, so i 'm just going to add some chopped coriander leaves on top for garnish.
take it off the heat and serve these with pita, breads, or some plain basmati, rice and there 's your quick chicken curry.
