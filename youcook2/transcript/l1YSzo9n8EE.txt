hey everyone i 'm judith jones, food and travel editor of the gourmet travel easter and today i 'm going to be showing you how to make the perfect grilled cheese.
the ultimate indulgence so for the classic grilled cheese, all going to need is start three very basic ingredients.
your bread, your cheese.
if you 're better so we have two slices of thickly sized white bread.
we have two slices of sharp cheddar cheese, and we have two tablespoons of butter now.
if you do n't have riddle, the best thing we can use is cast iron path that 's going to be the perfect instruments used to give you a perfect, golden crust.
so first things, first let 's get our red now be very generous with your butter.
and we 're going to butter one side of the bread now just to let you know.
we have got our pad on a medium heat, and we 've let it get nice and hard smoking hot.
in fact, we 're just going to really generously law the butter on this ca n't have enough butter and grilled cheese.
that 's what i say.
and we 're going to do the same to the other side alright.
get that old going there now this various different ways.
you can make grilled cheese, you know, a lot of people even do it in the oven, you can put the butter in first in the pan.
but this is one of the easiest and simplest are more well, known ways.
so we 've got our two breads, butters like that.
now i have my cheddar cheese.
but first of all, we 're going to put our bread butter side down into our cast iron pan and let that go a little.
now , i have my cheddar cheese, cheddar cheese is from a nice little village in somerset in england now.
there 's a lot of cheese.
is that say their cheddar?
but they 're not actually there just processed.
cheese is so if you want the actual chatterjee from england make sure you look at the label.
so we 've got our sharp cheddar cheese here.
you can use a mild one two, and we 're just going to place that on top of the bread with two slices nicely on there.
so , as that goes, we 're going to put our second bread butter side up on top of the cheese, and we 're going to let that all melts in there and it usually takes about three minutes ish to cook on either side.
we can be nice.
let it get a nice golden ground, so there you go now.
obviously , there 's tons of variations, you can do with the, with the grilled cheese, but this is like the really the classic one.
and you serve that with a nice tomato soup, and you 're done.
so , as that 's going nice medium heat, going to get that done for a couple of minutes.
so , we, as we see that cheese oozing in.
it 's been a couple minutes.
we 're going to do a clip quick flip of the sandwich.
so there we go flip it, and you can see it 's got a nice golden brown there.
and that 's exactly what we want so that butter is just going to.
crisp , the other side, and that cheese is just going to melt lovely inside now, we go another couple of minutes in there on your cast iron pan.
now the cast iron pine is great because it keeps in that heat.
an it makes the bread nice and crispy, crispy on the outside yet still nice and soft inside.
so that 's toasted really nicely it 's been another couple minutes and we 're just going to set it down on the cutting board.
but on the other side, and look at that perfect golden brown crispy, and we 're going to.
but that through the middle and we 're going to see that she 's losing how great, is that so indulgent?
and let 's just flight it up play by there, and there you have it, everyone is, that is your perfect grilled cheese.
