hello , in today 's lesson is all about making a curry paste.
this is something that i love to do.
i 've done it for many, many years.
but there are slight variations today 's pacers for alexa.
but basically, it 's the same ingredients to make many other places, well, which are kind of touch on a little bit.
first off, though i first started making them in a mortar and, pestle and it is a fantastic process you had a little bit at a time, and you continue to pound until it 's a very nice.
yes , but today, i 'm not going to do that.
i 'm going to show you how you can make a paste, so quickly.
and it 's just a beautiful thing to do.
and you 'll be surprised at the results that you get at the end if you do use your own paste so into my blender.
i have one red onion.
you can basically you could use a brown onion or anything.
chili 's in fact to make a red paste instead of using the dry across chili 's.
you 'd use fresh chili 's few clothes of garlic.
go straight in there lemongrass.
now this is a lemongrass paste.
if you can, and it 's available and if you can get some fresh lemongrass that there 's always the best a little tip with the lemongrass, though, do n't use the whole lot?
take off those fibers out of our leaps and just use the very centre.
now here 's a pretty.
this is called shrimp paste.
it is not the most pleasant thing to smell, but believe me.
it puts a beautiful base flavor into any carrie ann.
we must a few cloves OK i have a little bit of turmeric here.
some yellow curry powder OK that goes straight.
and , that is mild.
but you can use, can use whatever curry powder you like?
really that smart, you can use hot.
it really, it 's just that carry flavor that 's more important.
i like to adjust the amount of heat that you get from your paste with your chili 's, so, if you like it hot use as many chili 's as you like.
now i 'm going to post this start to bring it together.
but in order to get it to the right consistency i need to use a little bit of oil.
this is not olive oil or be canola oil, or peanut oil that 's peanut oil, you can use either or all i find is the peanut oil again.
it 's all about flavor.
so with asian food it 's just adding another base, flavor cats, really important.
keep bring the sides down on.
you see one at all kind of mashup at the same speed.
the thing to remember when you 're doing something like this, as uhm, just edged oil gradually, 'cause it 's better to have just enough oil to bring it together and not, too much, and i can tell her that just need a little bit more oil lid back on, OK, i 'm looking for a real paste consistency.
uhm , it 's quite thick.
if i was going to push it with my finger, i 'd make a little indentation into it and you should n't be able to you should n't be able to see any of your original ingredients.
so it does have to be popped up very finely.
i was recently on a trip to thailand, and i made a paste to feed sixty people, and it was n't a massive modern pistol that was a fourth or fifth generation.
let 's just say it took a lot longer than this one may have it.
OK , you can see there, now.
i 've got a beautiful paste consistency.
it will be absolutely delicious.
how do you store it OK the most important thing?
when you, i 'm going to store as again straight into a nice clean jar top.
it , with a little bit of oil, and it will last in the refrigerator and now the way you can do that is what i like to do.
i like to freeze it.
so you put into an individual ice cube and when you need when you just pop it out straight into your pan, and off you go fantastic it 's looking and smelling absolutely delicious better yet.
but another good mix up around there just to make sure everything is thoroughly combined.
and you can see here.
skype for a nice beautiful, thick paste.
and if you look really closely here you can see here.
it 's the right consistency.
it 's nice and thick, and you can actually make at any of the other ingredients.
now there is to do horrible hot wok fry that off until it becomes fragrant and then start having your other ingredients delicious.
