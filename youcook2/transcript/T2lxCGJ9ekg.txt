hey guys so continuing this month theme of easy family meals.
i had to include something with a slow cooker.
i love a slow cooker.
especially if you do n't have a lot of time to get dinner on the table.
they are such an ally in the kitchen.
so i 'm going to show you one of my favorite things to make in a slow cooker, crispy beef tacos.
let me show you how to make it so for this recipe.
i 'm using a slow cooker from cuisinart.
it 's their three in one multi cooker.
i really love this model because it comes with some pretty terrific features.
it actually does three different things.
talk to me right in it.
so , no need to take that insert over to the stove top.
you can do it right in the slow cooker.
it will steam things for you.
so it comes with a little rack that you can put in the center and actually steam fish or vegetables and of course, you can slow cook in it.
so hey, three features for the price of one campy.
now if you do n't have a slow cooker, you can actually also make this recipe in a regular stock pot, and i 'll leave you some instructions on the description on how to do that.
so , the first thing we 're going to do is we 're going to set the slow cooker to the brown and saute function at four hundred degrees.
then we 're going to put a little drizzle of olive oil in the pan and then we 're going to brown two pounds of ground , beef.
now this is really important.
because we do want to make sure that all of that meat is actually browned and cooked through first.
because when we go to slow , cook.
it did actually is only reaching two hundred degree fahrenheit temperature.
so you do want to make sure that all of your meat is actually cooked through ahead of time now.
if you did n't want to use the beef, you could also use ground chicken or ground turkey, or if you wanted to make it vegetarian you could use kidney beans.
now as our meat is browning, we 're also going to add two teaspoons of salt and some freshly cracked.
now this may look like a lot of salt at first, but it is important to really salt your meat.
well , especially as we 're going to be adding lots of other ingredients into this dish, and it 's going to be simmering for several hours.
so we want to make sure that we 're building upon that flavor and that these tacos become really tasty.
then once are meat is all browned.
we 're going to add a cup of diced onion.
five garlic cloves two cans of diced tomatoes, juice and all just throw.
it right in there.
three tablespoons of tomato paste and a cup of water, go ahead and just kind of give that a stir in making sure that all of that is incorporated.
now we 're going to add all the spices and my favorite spices for beef.
tacos are two teaspoons of smoked paprika, two teaspoons of ground cumin two teaspoons of ground coriander and four teaspoons of dried oregano.
so go ahead and just mix that all up and you 'll start to smell these delicious flavors start to come together and then all you are going to do is put the lid on and then you 're going to press slow cook and the temperature that you want to keep this on is low.
and then you can go ahead and go about your day head off to work or school.
and when you come home, you will be treated to the most delicious dinner overtime.
what happens when you make this recipe in a slow cooker.
all of those juices and meat and vegetables and spices, they all married together and create the most delicious sauce.
and in the final step, just before serving is to also add a teaspoon, or it will just keep your tacos.
a little bit of a tank you wo n't.
really , tasted like vinegar.
it will just height and all the flavors and they also like to add about another teaspoon of dried oregano.
give it a stir.
and then it 's ready to be brought to the table, and here 's the other thing why i like this slow cooker.
the cooking pot comes right out of the slow cooker and you can bring it to the table.
that way you can keep the lid on keep your meat warm.
why everybody serves themselves and the way that i like to eat.
these is take a store bought taco shell.
fill it with some of the taco mixture.
better cheese on top and some shredded iceberg lettuce, and then i also like to serve it with a selection of hot sauces and varying temperatures, depending on what everybody likes, and love this recipe.
because it is.
you have that very flavorful beef and the sharpness of the cheese and the coolness of lettuce.
it 's such a great weeknight meal that actually did all the cooking while you were at work or school.
i hope you guys.
