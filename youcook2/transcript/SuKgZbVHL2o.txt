i guys today on making one of my favorite dishes of all time tempura prawns.
and they 're very easy.
so for starters, you 'll need two hundred, and fifty, grams of green uncooked prawns.
now , i 've removed the shells of devein them.
but i 've left the tails intact.
so now for the better, take one cup of ice cold water.
now it 's very important that it 's ice cold add in one egg and give it a good mixed together.
now i 'm adding half a cup of plain flour and half a cup of corn flour nekhen, use just one cup of plain flour here.
but off on adding the cornflower adds an extra crispiness and lightness to the better, you can also add a pinch of bicarb and now, i 'm just going to give this a very gentle mix, do n't overwork it and do n't worry about removing the lumps and here i 've got, some oil preheated to one sixty degrees.
celsius now just a quick word on the oil guys.
it is very dangerous and if you do n't know how to use it properly then grab someone who does before trying this.
so now simply hold the problem by the tail and dip it into that beautiful light tempura batter, and then gently place it in the oil and repeat this for all of your prawns.
now i only cook them for a minute.
that 's all they need.
and then place them onto some paper tail or a wire rack.
so the excess oil can drain, and this is what you get guys absolutely beautiful.
and now i 'm going to quickly make up what has to be one of the world 's easiest dipping sauces.
just take four parts of mirren and one part soy sauce and give it a quick mix service.
alongside the prawns and enjoy, they have a guys absolutely awesome, be sure to give this wanna go.
they are brilliant thanks for watching, and i 'll catch you all next time.
