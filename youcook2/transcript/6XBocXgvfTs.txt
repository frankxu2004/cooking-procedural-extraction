hello , my name is vivian.
today will be making shrimp and scallop, shish, kabobs, have you?
ingredients will be using is the worchester sauce.
some garlic butter, some, butter, some paprika, some lemons to make the marination sauce, then it will be using scallops and shrimp make sure you devein a shrimp and peel the shrimp, and if they 're frozen, keep them in the fridge.
overnight , so that they defrost also will be using the sticks active how their irish spears you put it in the larger overnight and.
so they do n't burn on the grill, while you 're cooking your stuff.
now first, we 're going to make the marination sauce and first you 're going to put in a half a cup of butter right in the bar there, then we 're going to put in seven tablespoons of lemon juice, freshly squeezed and then we 're going to put in five tablespoons of chester sauce here.
we go very nice and then there gonna put about two dashes of garlic salt, you know, if you like more salty, you can go ahead and add that and about one dash at rego and a dash of love, once you mix it, you 're going to put it in the microwave or about until the butters melted.
maybe a minute, minute and a half about one third of the mix and set it aside for basing whether shish, kabobs on the grill, then you 're going to put the scallops and shrimp in a sealable bag.
so that they can marinate in there by themselves.
so you 're just going to let them all and put it in there.
and when you marinate them, you have to set them aside and mix them for about an hour.
or you set them aside for about an hour and then mix in mix them.
and in settlement science for about an hour there, we go you 're going to florida.
the mix inside goodbye do n't feel push it around his bitch.
after about an hour you take.
him , out of the fridge, and then it 's time to irish, spear them in favorite part and start with a lemon wedge.
first , he put that right on there.
and then you 're going to alternate the shrimp and the scallops.
sure you get some nice and even there you just going to feel fill the whole kabob up and then they got enough right should we had one more.
add one more shrimp marriage that should be good.
you want to make sure that you do n't put them too close together.
is if you put him to close together they do n't cook all the way around now?
the reason we put lemon wedges on him is that when they 're done cooking, or you 're going to stand them up under grea while their hot and then you 're going to squeeze the lemon ridge.
so that the juice runs down the whole stick alright that gives them their last minute flavor, that lemon about that, that are over there, grill uncovered, over medium hot heat for about six minutes, turning once brush with reserved marinade the one we set aside earlier real eight to ten minutes longer or until sherman turned pink, and i hope you enjoy the shrimp and scallop shell bob 's.
