hi , i 'm new, tasha.
and today we 're going to be poaching eggs to make eggs benedict.
we 're going to do that using the castle an egg poacher.
this makes poaching eggs beautiful and very easy to do.
you 'll notice that each cup has perforated insides you can do one egg, or you can do all six like we 're going to do today.
i have each of my eggs in a ramekin.
i 'm just going to gently slide each egg into its cup.
the reason you want to keep each egg separate, is just in case you get any shells?
you 're not going to hurt the egg, and it allows you to discard any eggs if you break the yolk.
i have about an inch and a half of water underneath at a nice steady simmer with some vinegar, and some salt once all the eggs are in your going to cover it with this lid this leads perfect 'cause it 's glass.
and you can watch the eggs poach.
it 's going to take about three to four minutes are eggs already so let 's remove them from the pan.
since we did six eggs, we 're going to use this center, handle an just left all of 'em out at once to make it much easier.
if you 've done individual ones, you can even lift him out by this handle on the side of each cup.
now we 're ready to put our eggs benedict together, we 're going to start with a piece of sourdough toast, and we 're going to spread on some of our green onion compound butter.
once this is, an we 're going to use hand today.
but you could certainly use smoked salmon, or, if you 'd like to do a vegetarian one you could do grilled vegetables or tomato and avocado.
now we 're just going to delicately place.
are beautifully poached eggs from the catholic.
and then we 're going to finish with some hollandaise sauce going to drizzle some on top and then a little bit around the.
edge , and then let 's garnish it with some green onions.
anna sprinkle of paprika are eggs.
benedict is done the calphalon egg poacher is easy to use, and i know you 'll have great results at home.
