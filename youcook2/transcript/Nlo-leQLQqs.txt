today , i 'm going to show you how to make perfect meso soup now.
mississippi for japanese is comfort food.
we eat this at least once a day and depending on which season.
it is or which region it 's made.
we have many, many different kind of mississippi, for example, summertime we put some of vegetables and winter time.
we put something like diakon, radish and mean so if it 's, in kyoto we use white.
and if it 's it prefecture we use red missile.
so there 's not just one type of mississippi, but today, i 'm going to show you some basic mississippi today.
i 'm going to use diakon radish welcome.
you see, meat tofu scallion, and this is combined me.
so , so, it 's not really white no red.
it 's kind of like in between.
and this is dashie.
dog , made from kombu, kelp, bonito, flake.
so , let 's start now.
first of all, you 're going to put dashie into the pot and turn on the heat.
now when it comes to me.
so you do not want to boil me, so, the reason is it 's a fermented food.
and you have so many microorganisms living inside.
so if you boil this, the harsh heat will destroy the flavor and it just does n't taste good.
so , whatever you need to boil you need to boil before adding me, so, so, today there 's only one thing that i need to, boil, which is british.
so i 'm going to cook this in the dashi like this and let it cook.
so that comma dishes cooked already.
now we can start adding tofu how wakame seaweed, and we 've got we 're going to put the scallion at the very end before serving.
now we 're going to put me.
so now before we add me.
so you want to turn off the heat.
so that it does n't boil over and per one cup of dashi stock we 're going to use one tablespoon of missile.
but this is all depends on what type of mister you 're using 'cause some missile is more saltier than the other.
so make sure you taste as you go for example, if you have three cups of dashie put two tablespoon first.
and then taste, and if you need some more than add one more, so this is how you do this you do n't have to have this one.
you just need regular strainer and alright.
go so all you do is just mix this and make.
everything is dissolved thank, so all dissolved very cold.
and then you 're going to turn on the heat again, but this time you 're just warming this up not boiling it.
so this is already a good temperature.
an it 's ready to be served, you 're going to turn up the heat and just scoop.
then i prefer pudding scallion right before serving like.
so , and it 's ready to be served.
