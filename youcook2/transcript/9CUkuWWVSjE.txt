honey , when it 's summer time so i can make some hot diggity corn dogs.
what we need is a package of hot dogs, and you can use any kind of hot dogs that you like you can use all be.
what will need to do is open this package up and then place the hot dogs into the microwave?
and i 'm going to use my defrost button on my microwave and defrost these for four minutes.
because i wanna bring them to room temperature while my hot dogs are in the microwave.
i 'm going to make some homemade buttermilk and to do that you 'll need some milk, and some apple cider vinegar comes in a bottle like this, then just take the apple cider vinegar and pour it into the milk.
take a spoon.
and that 's it.
let it sit for five minutes, and then will have some soured milk here.
are all the ingredients that you 'll need to make the corn dog batter?
we have some all purpose flour yellow cornmeal salt baking powder, baking soda in sugar in all of these ingredients can be purchased at your local nine, nine cent store for ninety nine cents except for the yellow cornmeal, i had purchased this at stater brothers in i believe it was about five dollars.
so let 's go ahead and placed all of these ingredients into this bowl here start out with the flower, and then the yellow cornmeal salt baking powder baking soda and the sugar, and i 'll have all the measurements for these ingredients listed in the description box below and just whisk to combine everything, everything should be well, incorporated and then.
let 's go ahead and set this aside, the buttermilk has been sitting for five minutes, so.
let 's go ahead and add the egg and will wish that.
now that the two have been combined.
let 's add the wet ingredients into the die for this right inch.
and again we 're going to whisk to combine everything.
this whisk until it 's smooth.
what everything is.
well , combined said the better side.
and let it rest for thirty minutes.
next will want to take a piece of paper, towel.
and dry your hot.
dogs , it 's just last one there.
back on the petyo will fella hang up if you want to try the other side as well, so flip them over path and dry like that.
then we 're gonna roll them in some corn starch, and that would help the better stay on the dogs when we fry them.
so place a handful of corn stars on your cutting board or cutting mat, which is what i 'm using.
and i also have some skewers here.
this is the regular length of the skewer.
but i went ahead in broken off of about two inches from the bottom to make them a little bit shorter.
because if i was to leave the skewer at its full length i wo n't be able to cook my corn dogs in my walk it wo n't fit.
so , i went to hit in just snapped off the bottom.
two inches of the skewer and then we 're going to insert the skewer into the center of the hotdog minutes and then look like this that place.
the skewers into the center of the hot dogs.
now i 'm just going to take one and roll it into the cornstarch just want to lightly coat it this kind of spread it out here and then shake off any of the excess flour.
give me a light coating.
it needs the hot dogs are nicely coated with the cornstarch, and i 'm also going to heat up the oil in my walk.
so i had to turn the heat to medium, high.
and here i have a tall glass, which has a plastic baggie in it.
and we 're going to pour the batter right inside.
so go ahead and spoon, some of the batter right into the tall glass.
and we 're going to fill it to the top just like.
this , if you like to know when your oil is ready.
all you have to do is take a wooden skewer and stick it right into the oil.
once you see some bubbles form around it, then it 's ready to go, get the oil should be hot.
let 's go ahead and take a hot dog.
we 're going to dunk it into the batter slowly all the way down, so it 's completely covered in a squeeze a little bit up from the top.
that 's why i have the bag in there so that i completely cover the hot dog with the better, it just makes it a bit easier.
and as you take it out just kind of to roll it around.
like that slowly take it out of the better like this beautiful just go ahead and immediately place it into the oil hold it for three seconds and then let it go gently, like that.
ann is at the bottom of the walk right now, but you can see it 's going to slowly float to the top.
and it 's going to spin itself around a little bit and just leave it there for a little while.
after that you 'll want to rotate your corn dogs so that it can brown evilly.
see it 's going to spin by itself, so you do n't have to do anything.
i should take three minutes depending on your heat.
check on it here.
it 's kind of browned on the bottom, so go ahead and turn it over so it can ground the other side as well.
it 's a beautiful corndog.
i 'm just going to hold it here because the bottom needs to be grounded.
