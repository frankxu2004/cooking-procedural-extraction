could glance vegan, lisi, hi, everyone, it 's anya from cooking with plants and today on making a no oil added comments?
this is great for a snack whenever you 're hungry great for breakfast lunch or dinner and great for your kids and for lunch is.
so let 's get started.
the main ingredients that are used as a base for my hummus is a tin of chick peas and a tin of cannellini beans or butter beans or any other white theme that you may have on hand.
i do sometimes called from scratch, as well, but just for a quick easy hummus recipe.
i like to use the tinned and i also use some of the liquid from the team.
so these are organic and they are in water and some salt.
so i wo n't be adding too much extra salt sometimes.
i do n't add any extra salted, or just depending on who i 'm cooking for on the day and what the purposes for the homeless.
so start by just dream lee very quickly, skip the juice element.
she pays coldest roughly drain them.
there will be some chick peas, leftover.
i 'm using a food processor today.
it just takes less liquid to actually make them.
but i do quite often make it in the blender as well, you 'll just need to add more liquid till you get the right consistency in goes the ten of chickpeas.
so next, i 'm going to do the same thing as i just did with the cheapies.
but with the cannellini beans gain roughly draining them well.
i remember i 'm also going to take out just a few of these chickpeas for decorating the homeless at the end when i put them into a bowl to also.
just leave those there in a little on a little plate for later, and no add in mckenna laney beans.
so each of these teens has four hundred and twenty.
five grams, so, yeah, if you, if you 're cooking, these from scratch, maybe about a cup and a half to two cups and then you can just gauge the moisture level and add more moisture to the mixtures you need it next.
i 'm heading into very large clothes of garlic.
it 's up to you.
how much garlic you want to use sometimes we use up to six cloves of garlic, so, if my husband likes to be very heavy handed with these garlic today i 'm just using two large cloves probably equivalent to about four small or for regular size clothes days.
OK next time adding the juice of one lemon, you can add the juice of two.
if you like a lemony taste, just adjust the taste as you go as to your preference.
next time, adding two tablespoons of tahini, which is just ground up sesame E paste.
there 's no added oil in this paste at all.
it 's just one hundred percent.
ground up sesame E seeds, so this is really good for on a little bit of extra on.
and the lemon juice in this will also help with the absorption of the eye and see i love your humor next time.
adding in one teaspoon of ground, up khuman seeds.
but you can also use the whole seeds if you like their nice, add a little bit of a nice texture in there , too.
today , i 'm adding the ground version as i mentioned earlier.
we are going to be adding some of the salty liquid from the beans and the chick peas.
but you can add salt and pepper to taste, and i am going to add a little bit of celtic sea salt today.
and some white paper, i just like the way in the whitepaper, brings out the flavors.
so i 've got about one teaspoon of celtic sea salt, and about quarter of a teaspoon of the white paper now, as i mentioned earlier when i 'm making homus depending on if i 'm making it in the food processor or in my blender the liquid that 's used will vary.
because you do n't need as much liquid when using a food processor.
so just to start with.
i 'm going to put probably about that 's quarter of a cup and for a little bit, and so that half a cup there to start with.
and i 'll just start that blending process, and just see what the texture will be like.
and if i need to adjust it all do.
so at that time.
so that 's been pressing for about half a minute, and, that is quite a rush consistency of probably could have even used.
a little bit less liquid, i 'm just so used to making it in my blender.
instead of here that it 's ended up a bit more running, so maybe start with quarter of a cup of the mixture.
give it a taste test.
i 've actually got my son home today.
so i 'm going to call he mean in a minute, to test this and give you some feedback on how good this is no case.
i 've got my son josh with me here.
and he loves his home.
is sir under serving him out some and it 's going to take five getting to get him to do a taste test for you there?
we go making me hungry.
how 's that place.
awesome if you rather kind heart made home is in such a long time.
so where does having made with some little rice crackers.
brown rice crackers with a little bit of tamari seaweed photos and that 's just a really easy combination.
it 's also great with some carrot sticks or the bell peppers dipped into it.
anything you like, really these are just fantastic.
so , if you like today 's recipe, please give it a thumbs up.
