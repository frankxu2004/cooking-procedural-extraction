the actual cooking of peptide takes less than ten minutes.
it 's important to have all of your ingredients ready to go so the first thing to do is soak up all the ingredients that need soaking.
for instance, the noodles the backbone of the pets i recipe so i 'm going to soak them in warm water can soak them in cold water.
this is not hot water, hot water will cook the noodles, which you do n't want to do soak them until they are pliable.
the next thing we 're soaking are the shrimp.
these are dry shrimp and they 're really used for seasoning more than anything just seasoning and they have assault, a salty flavor.
you 're not talking about twenty minutes, and it 's important when you 're choosing the shrimp at the market to look for something that 's orange pink in color really needy, with less shell, just look for something that 's plump like this, and just a beautiful bright color.
the main protein in pad thai is pressed tofu, you can tell it 's pressed about.
i would say maybe three quarters of an inch thick and all the water has literally been pressed out of it so the texture is a little bit chewy.
and it 's a great thing for when you 're doing stir fries.
because it retains the texture even when it does n't break apart in the walk here, we 're going to do is just slice the tofu.
and i 'm using a cleaver but use anything you want.
chefs knife is quite alright.
there we go.
the next thing we 're going to do is put together the sauces seasoning this is where we 're really balancing the flavors between sweet salty and sour three notes.
so far will be adding bitter and spicy later on main ingredient.
here is palm sugar palm sugars from the coconut palm tree.
we 're going to do is break it up a little bit.
it comes as a paste or little blocks.
but either version will work to this.
i add tamarind concentrate and that gives the sour note to the recipe and to that fish sauce.
so like i said, sweet, sour and salty just keep whisking the sauce until it 's smooth almost there.
OK , it looks great.
and now the last ingredient that we add to our stir fry is garlic which i 've already chopped.
and then we 're going to prep art garnishes.
first , we 're going to slice the scallion.
what i like to do is slice it diagonally for presentation.
i find it, it looks prettier.
anne , now, i 'm going to prep the thai chilies, because i would like to have a perfectly round slice.
i just roll the pod right in between my fingers to loosen the seeds, and then i just cut the stems off and the seat, scroll out despoil the very few last ones.
and now just the slicing of this perfectly round slice now you may want to wear gloves where you 're dealing with chili 's next ingredient.
far garnish is the mung bean sprout now.
what i like to do here, is actually take the mung beans and snap aph that little root end that brownish part just to make it cleaner, and there you have it very simple and another garnish are.
the peanuts just roasted unsalted peanuts.
and i just chop these coarsely.
the last garnish is this thai basil, you 'll recognize it by its purple stem right here.
the leaves are fragrant, giving licorice flavor to the dish.
so here i 'm just going to snap the leaf off, and then just tear it and throw it on your noodle dish just before you serve it, and we 're ready to stir fry.
because the stir frying goes.
so fast you want to make sure that all of your ingredients are right near you, right near the walk and.
in addition to what we prepped earlier.
i have the chicken stock and four eggs right here.
so now i 'm going to do is i usually set the walk on the back burner.
so it does n't spit the oil is n't spit back at you and here.
i have it set over a high flame.
because we 're stir frying an, the idea is just to keep the ingredients moving very quickly.
so now we have a little bit of grapeseed oil.
i 'm going to add the garlic and we 're going to stir fry that it 's slightly golden and just as it 's about to turn, you can see.
it 's a little golden here on the edges.
i 'm going to start a little bit, i 'm going to add the shrimp here.
we go surprise that until fragrant try to do is really just bring out the flavors here and this is about right.
so we 're going to move the shrimp from the walk.
we 're building the flavors, one layer at a time going to add a little bit more oil and now we 're going to add the tofu.
and if you can see what we 're using firm to poop.
it does n't break apart like regular posters, which is why it 's often used in stir fries, and we 're just kind of terrified this until it 's nice and golden.
so this is a really nice color, so this is what you 're trying to achieve throughout the stir fry, appear this is about right.
and then we 're going to move on to the next ingredients and add a little bit more oil.
swirl this around a little bit.
and now we have our eggs.
and what you want to do with the eggs are scrambled them without necessarily mixing him too much.
you wanted fair amount of white and yellow and you want to make sure that they 're not too wet.
but also, not to try.
so you want a nice glistening effect on the top of the egg, and we 're almost there, there.
we go and this is done.
so here we wipe any excess egg in the walk.
they were ready to move on to the next step.
so again we 're going to add oil, and then this beautiful, south of cameron fish sauce and palm sugar.
and now the chicken stocks into this we 're ready to add the noodles now.
they 're nice and soft beautifully pliable, i know.
we 're doing here is just draining them loosely.
it 's OK, put a little water goes back into the walk is good right now and now.
this is going to cook for about.
i think four or five minutes absorbing all of the liquid and really building that beautiful flavor into the noodle itself.
so now the noodles have absorbed most of the liquid, it still has a little bit more to absorb it right.
now is about the right time to incorporate the shrimp with garlic and the tofu, and we 're just going to incorporate all that mix it up really nicely, and as you can see the noodles are continuing to absorb the remaining liquid, and.
at the same time that we 're doing is really moistening the tofu.
and the shrimp noodles are beautiful right now.
i believe we 're ready to serve.
so you want to put a fair amount of noodles in the bowl.
and , then top that with some tofu dry shrimp make it look nice and pretty there.
we go and.
now we 're ready to garnish and when you 're in thailand, and you 're sitting at one of those you pull up to one of the street vendors cards, you know, they 'll have pets high for you, and you 'll be able to garnish your very own time entertaining at home.
i just like to serve it beautifully, garnished already here.
what i 'd like to do is break up the eggs and put him off to one side just like this.
you want some of the white part and the yolk and to this, i 'm going to add the mung bean sprouts, pile them up like.
so and hear more color gets really, pretty just a little bit of scallion.
some crunchy peanuts all around not a beautiful vibrant color of red chillies, and thai basil.
now i 'm doing here is just tearing the basel.
like so and for the finishing touch the line now, what they do in thailand is harv something that goes into the plate.
so this is a garnish we 're using the line which will squeeze on top of the dish afterwards.
but this recalls the beautiful carvings that thailand is.
so famous for, and it 's really.
you just run the blade right on the edge of the line, and then you just turn in all these little cuts, you 've made around the line.
and there 's your dish right here now.
i just have a taste of this delicious noodle dish.
this is exactly what we wanted this sweet from the palm sugar, the sourness from the tamarin and the lime juice saltiness from the fish sauce heat from the chili 's everything is there in the single dish.
