my name is elizabeth denise on the director of culinary arts and the college executive chef of burlington county college today.
i 'd like to make a very simple irish boxty, which is a great way to use leftover, mashed potatoes here.
we have some nice fresh, shredded potato.
some fresh dill, some mashed potatoes leftover from last night 's dinner.
some fresh sour cream and some wonderful smoke salmon.
i purchased this morning.
we 're going to start with making our potato pancakes.
i 'm just going to take a little bit of the leftover potato mash.
it , in a bowl i want to take a little bit of the shredded potato and mix it with the mashed potato, and then going to take the little pancake that i have.
take shredded potato and essentially just press it into the outside of the pancake, so you get this wonderful little potato pancake that 's coated with fresh shredded potatoes.
you do n't want it too thick because you want it nice and crispy and you want to fluffy on the inside.
i 've already sees in the mashed potatoes.
so i wo n't be seasoning again until the pancake is out of the frying pan is going to turn on the frying pan, the little bit of oil not too much.
just enough to coat the bottom of the pan.
we 're going to let that heat up for just a moment will put our pancake in there.
you can also add things to the potato before you make a cake out of it, you can add a little bit of ham or a little bit of fresh chives or fresh dill makes a wonderful addition.
just be a moment in the pan is heated, we 're going to let that cook for about three minutes on either side.
so it 's nice and brown up.
so as you can see our pancake here is just about finished.
we 're just flipped it over.
we did letting the pancake cook on the other side.
let me grab my plate, just wanna make sure this is nice and crispy.
salmon little bit more shower cream, right on the top there little bit of fresh dill and there you have a smoke salmon potato boxing great way to get rid of leftover.
potato , and make a beautiful breakfast or brunch dish.
you can also make this fish in miniature and servant as an order at your next house party.
