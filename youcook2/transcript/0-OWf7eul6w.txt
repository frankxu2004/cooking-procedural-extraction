i never feel guilty about anything at all, and books of wonder, would it be like to actually be a food critic sort of three hundred sixty five days a year and imaginably good.
so much better than being a chef?
i contacted listen before christmas is really important.
i would love to have a food critic in the kitchen just to show you an insight so it 's like beautiful days, work.
and being up at six o'clock in the morning it 's like saying, let 's center policeman.
i 'd like to spend a day in prison.
i know it 's bad in there.
that 's why i 'm not in there as a critic.
do you think of the starter, then i have to have.
so much is a great piece of photo from there from my stocks.
but in terms of in terms of the provenance of it is nice to know at least it came from quite nutty about that sort of thing?
there is a rumor that you went into russian ones and actually ask the name of it before you get it.
yes , i have done that.
but really the name of the farm will do.
and even though you not for me you are, more and more into this you got something going on at home, which is fairly sort of hue family which, in source to harmony, i mean, i live in the city i want my children to learn and understand where their food comes from this.
for that 's right, and why they got.
so much space they can run, run, run around and get what and exercise galaxy size exactly get fun gangster site surprise, surprise gardens had one of his fantastic ideas which i 'm not exactly over the moon about he 's decided that we are going to grow christmas lunch.
he wants to make the children understand that christmas lunch actually comes from somewhere not just from the supermarket.
so we 're going to fatten up the turkeys and grow our own vegetables.
but nothing will get really attached them, you know, that only then we tough old birds.

four weeks weather what 's the difference in weight, will sell the bronze turkeys from about seven or eight pounds oven ready right up to sort of thirty pounds OK three more turkeys, need a dart, which is rich in cereals, and.
so we put at least seventy percent weight farley outs into the diet, and that gives us a lovely finish.
and that gives you a marvelous christmas land today.
