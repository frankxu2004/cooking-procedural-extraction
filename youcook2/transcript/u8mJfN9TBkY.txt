crispy tender pieces of fish served alongside.
some beautiful hassle back potatoes, now if you 're going to make hasselbeck potatoes what you need to do is hindley slice them.
and we 're going to thinly sliced them.
my top tip is to put them in the well of a wooden spoon like this, and then the whale in the wooden spoon prevents, you from going all the way to the bottom.
so what you get left with is there check this age is this wonderful to data that has a bit of movement and all of the layers become really crispy.
but the bottom stays together.

once you have a big tray of these little hassle back hedgehog potatoes, what you need to do is grab a little bit of melted butter and just brush each one writes over the top.
so that all those little bits of butter melts through and into those little cracks what will happen when they come out of the oven will get lonely crispy little layers and served alongside.
our fish absolutely delicious sprinkle with a little bit of sea salt.
nice crack, black pepper.
and into the oven, where i do have some, which have been cooking up.
you have the most crispy beautiful little layers of potatoes, so served alongside our fish and chips.
this is essentially our chips now.
we need to talk about our fish.
the fish is a little bit unusual.
because it has a beer batter and not everyone uses a beer batter.
but a beer batter is very easy to make.
so into a bowl.
some plain flour.
you need to make sure that you have nice cold beer.
because as soon as that cold beer with all those little fizzy bits hit start hot pawn it 's going to be absolutely delicious.
so just make a whale in the bottom here.
the beer, it does two things in this situation, it gives a little bit of flavor.
kind of nice tank, but it also gives a wonderful popped off batter, which goes really, really crispy seasoned up with some sea salt and some black pepper.
and this is good to go were going to dredge.
are fish so that we make sure that the battery fits around aurora sticks to it?
so dredges in a little bit of flour and season again with some black pepper and some seesaws.
once you have a nice phoenix through grab, some goo johns of haddock or cod.
just tosses in that lovely flower when you 're looking to buy fish what you want to look for is skinless fish.
and you want a nice piece of fish that you can cut into pieces like this, there about two inches by one inch and there are nice hefty size piece of fish.

we 've got our beer batter and we 've got the heat on our pan of oil.
i 've gotta make two inches of sunflower oil in here, pleasing off and the way to check that it is done is take a wooden spoon and just dip it in there.
and if little bubbles come up like that you are in business take your dredged pieces of fish.
dip them in that lovely batter, and what you want to do essentially is take it and kind of drip off any access.
and once you 've drift off, any access get it straight in , there.
