i got we have one of my absolute favorites here.
today , you 'll need some schnitzels.
but it should be veal.
some flowers a couple of bait and eggs some bread crumbs and some salt and pepper, i 'm going to stop by just seasoning the flour with the salt and pepper then give it a mix and get that veal schnitzel, and just code it lightly in flour.
then dip it in the egg, and then code it well, with bread crumbs and that 's all you need to do for this step guys.
so just repeat this for all of your schnitzels.
and then set them to one side, and we 'll get started on the potato pancake.
so here i 've got a large potato and half an onion, which are grated and squeezed out all the excess moisture.
you really need to get this as dry as possible.
a couple of teaspoons of flour, an egg, yolk and some salt and pepper.
now this is very easy.
just throwing all these ingredients, season, well, and then mix it all together now.
i 've got a couple of barbecue plates here headed to a medium heat.
so i 'm just going to stop by putting a bit of oil on one of them and also melting some butter onto it.
and we 're going to get that potato pancake and flatten it out.
and we 're going to give this about a five minute head start over the schnitzels 'cause it will take longer to cook now.
you want to make sure you keep a medium heat here.
or else it will burn so after about five minutes, i 'm just going to turn over that potato pancake.
and it is looking fantastic cook for another couple of minutes.
and then add some oil and some butter to the other flight then just put on the schnitzels.
and you only need to cook days for about a minute to two minutes per side.
now you want to take care, turning them.
you , wanna break up those bread crumbs.
and i are looking absolutely fantastic or will not be long.
now , so once they done simply take them out under some paper towel to drain off the excess oil light up and then squeeze on a bit of lemon juice, and you are done guys.
now this is absolutely awesome.
in my opinion, far better than chicken smithells, so check it out thanks for watching and i 'll catch you all next time.
