so , the first thing i 've done for the cock mature is i 've buttered the bread with some butter toasted it on.
let 's golden brown on one side.
so what i 'm going to do next going to flip it over and get a little bit of mustard.
smira just over the bread.
i 'm using board, be a quality assured precooked sliced ham.
and of course, you can cook your own hand.
this is lovely.
it 's delicious, very convenient.
and this is what i love about assignments like this.
it 's so test.
it would make this regularly in the restaurant.
two slices of the hand and then lots of the cheese sprinkle.
it all over so the cheese is just a nice mature cheddar cheese, and it 's just pre created now.
this needs to go back onto the grill to melt, and this just takes a minute.
have your grill on full, so while it 's on, it 's going to talk to you about wanting to put on the very top of the copy, sure?
and it 's a basha mel and the ingredients.
in addition, there are very, very easy, probably the first sources i ever made as a chef so you have equal quantities of butter and flour.
would you do is cook them out?
you make a rue and then you add in some milk.
i 'm using full fat milk in this, and then the last thing i put in is a little bit of nutmeg.
so it works really well, in the sandwich.
cook it all together.
so it becomes nice and thick.
and you keep whisking it.
so there 's no lumps.
and this can be done ahead.
i put a little bit of cheese into this.
also , so again it enriches it, and it 's delicious also with this very simple salad, so this is just some grated carrot.
some fresh carrots followed goodness which is already pre created and you can see if you use the course end of the greater soapier carrots.
a little bit of beetroot now i 'm using some raw beet root or you can use some cook pictures in this does n't really matter.
so this goes into our dish and alter some red onion.
so slice the red onion.
everything was in here any interest in texture.
but also vinegar kind of like a sharp taste, and this what i have here are some gerken cut into little strips.
so it lovely little pickle little bit of jerky goes in there and i love radish, and with radishes, tinley sliced like this, you can have this done again.
this , since i 'm going to make this all together with some toasted sesame E seeds, and then i have a small little dress in mid and in the dressing.
i have some olive oil with a squeeze of lemon juice and some salt and pepper do n't overdress it just a couple spoonfuls of this.
we put a pinch of salt ninja pepper into this, and then just mix this really, well, just go right down to the bottom.
so that 's that ready to go love being colorful.
remember , you eat with your eyes, but it 's all about the test.
so i 'm just going to check in the sandwiches should be ready.
the next layer is to go on and then the best meals are now, so, after a couple of minutes, the cheese is lovely.
golden brown, nice and bubbly.
so now the final stage is that piece that i took off the tree.
so he wanted to catch its buttered and toasted that goes on.
and there were b√©chamel.
so couple spoons of this smira town does n't matter falls down the sides.
the whole idea.
and will actually protect the top of the bread that 's going to take a minute or two.
let 's golden brown, and i 'm going to be ready to be served.
so , after a minute or two under the grill is beautiful.
and golden brown smells delicious just be careful.
and it 's extremely hot is using the fish.
nice is lifted off and the cheese will catch story with it and it 's going to cut in wedges, look at that you can just pull on there.
and one can arrest him just on top like that, and then we got to serve our salad for mass mix and plenty of this.
here big pile of this and i love serving something on wood looks.
it 's a pilot nice and high with the salad, and that i think is just a real family, favors as the cook mature with the carrot and beetroot salad and remember always choose food with the board be equality mark.
so that you know, where your food comes from and that has been produced to the highest board via quality standards.
