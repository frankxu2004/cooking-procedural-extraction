hi , everyone, this is stacy at, with me here have checked after church today and want to make a perfect game.
she said people been telling me that if i want to make a perfect sushi i had to talk to you.
yeah , i would say so.
i mean, i 'm pretty expert.
i 've been doing it since i was basically like two years, old with my grandma.
so i learned from the best so people easily say, i have the best.
kimchi in NYC 's.
so here i have a catfish.
how do we make him?
what are the ingredients in one head of napa cabbage, and, you know, you want to trim the, you know, outside just like the head over here, just to clean it up a bit you just do this, yeah, all you have to do that and then hang out like that is OK and then for this one?
i 'm probably going to quarter it just because these cavities are very big.
butt like that, and from here my grim, always used to trendy outside it.
just a little bit just to clean it up matter coffee water and rock salt here and a tablespoon get regular kosher salt.
i would not.
i would get the rock salt only, because kosher salt has different fault content than the rocks.
it 's a lot saltier.
so , if you could i would try to get the rock salt page like this when it a little bit, and then you have to make sure you salt.
thank you every, you know, because that way is all either meeting, saturday, no.
and then, after four hours, you 'll flip it like that OK eight hours.
instead of, yes, i would say eight to ten and you really need to taste it.
make sure it 's like this.
all is embedded into the cabbage after ten hours basically automize share went out.
so , we 're going to make the paste as you would call it, and i am using a lot of ingredients.
but this is very, very special.
if you add this to your can cheat, nothing can replicate, that is dried fish.
this one is drive cohn and find it in any previous people, mark any asian any easier supermarket from here.
i 'm going to add a little bit of water just to voicing it up just a little bit and this way.
it helps it.
she looks like on here.
and this is kind of texture with texture tasted everything scallions here that 's probably one bunch and then apple peering, you know, what you can probably just put it all in a food processor and pulse it all at once OK this is one.
echo would get one apple are you gonna use one apple and.
this , i, i would say happen after this.
i 'll quarter cup here, maybe actually, yeah, in ginger, i 'll probably only use a table.
two punch also use probably a little bit more than digital like two tablespoons.
this is onion puree, and i 'm going to use a quarter cup of this first one is.
our salted shrimp, which is acts like a fish sauce, OK anchovy fish thought people amount you could think equal about anchovy fish sauce.
this is lance fish sauce.
OK , this is some fun extract, you know, or you can use like mirin or some, a little bit of sugar in something for, and this is rice route that i made in advance.
so this is like the heart.
this makes peace being sticky.
and make this pickle.
where , where we, where.
we find this, this is, this is actually very simple just rice flour that you boil with, uh, oil in a pan and with a little water in there cat comes just in case somebody get paid yes.
so you just figure it for like ten minutes i was doing and then it comes with yeah, OK.
so this, i 'm gonna add thanks, man eating came crunchy a lot.
but this is my first time making yeah, yeah i mean, i do n't know if this complicated it is called it is, quite it seems computed to see.
but it 's actually if you get used to it that 's true i think trying to make you just add that in there like that, and then chance, yeah, please, yeah, please, put on a pair of bug i love your help, you know, i love to make a lot of this are red chili flakes green retro replace.
because i like my kitchen spicy.
but you know, if your tolerance is not as great as mine probably for the colour i think it 's quite busy.
but if you add a good amount of it first and then i 'll add this OK mix everyday everything really well, and, then i 'm gonna call just that much.
and then it expecting you spell.
it , it is actually kind of nice, but you can really smell, yeah, he starts now about making sure that separate.
yeah , so i just added very, very red, very red.
you kinda wanna.
do this because that way it becomes a piece and then from here when the pepper soaks up the fish sauce in the liquid from the die con and all the ingredients if he comes PC?
also , you know, you want to give it almost circular motion, circular motion kind of like rock bobby wrapping it.
you have this already now.
it 's ready now, you 're ready to put this inside happy.
