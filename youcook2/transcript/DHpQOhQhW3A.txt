i 'm going to start by making the batter here.
i 'm going to add in my flower.
i will put the full ingredients down below.
because i 'm only doing half a recipe here that in my cornmeal, my sugar salt and baking soda, and i 'm just going to take a whisk.
he ran wisc this together just kind of make sure that the dry ingredients are incorporated together.
now do this.
i 'm going to add in my milk as well as an egg, excuse the arm.
i 'm just going to wish this together until it comes together now that this is mixed together and smooth.
i 'm going to set this off to the side and start working on the hot dogs for the hot dogs.
i just got plain old, regular hot dogs.
here you can use all beef if you 'd like these just happen to be cheap ones because they were on sale anyway.
i 'm going to cut these into thirds just like so, and i 'm going to put these into a bowl here that just has some flower in it.
and i 'm going to coat these with the flower, so with that, or sticks better to them alright.
so i went ahead and shook off all the excess flower on my hot dogs, and what i 'm going to do is take these.
and i had my oil heated to three hundred fifty degrees over medium heat in a saucepan, and i 'm just watching that all i 'm going to do is.
do these in small batches since i 'm using a small pan here to friday 's end?
i 'm just going to put these into the batter and cover these make sure that they get completely coded in your batter.
and , and then just go ahead an fish them out one by one and carefully lower them into the oil and these do n't take very long at all, to fry up maybe just a few minutes they will automatically turn themselves when they 're done, and, while these are cooking, you want to make sure.
monitor , the temperature of your oil so it does n't get too hot.
you 'll need to adjust your burner heat either up or down to make sure that it stays right around three hundred and fifty.
when there are nice.
golden brown, go ahead and carefully lift them out and put them onto a paper towel lined plate, or a wire rack.
if that 's what you have, and then go ahead and finish frying up the rest of your hot dogs and, once you get all your corn dogs fried up this is what they will look like hope you guys enjoy and thanks.
so much for watching.
