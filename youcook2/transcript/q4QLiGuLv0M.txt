today , chef county is going to teach us how to make shrimp and vegetable tempura.
so we 're going to focus first time making the batter.
and then we 're going to focus on frying all the fun stuff.
OK , what 's the first step.
so we have wet ingredients, dry ingredients.
i 'll mix the dry.
you do the wet.
we 've got an egg, you 've got ice cold water.
i have flour and baking soda, so go ahead and get with the web break up the yolk.
now there 's a lot of schools of thought on the batter.
some people like to use seltzer water because of the air.
and it helps make it lighter.
and that can work at the end of the what i have found, is this works?
i like this recipe show.
because you can make it, and you can let it sit and not have to worry about the seltzer water, getting flat, that 's perfect.
so now we have our wet ingredients.
he ran are dry.
and you 're going to mix, well, i pour the flower into the egg batter.
you want to go dry, too wet for this procedure.
OK , i 'm going to gradually pour the flower into the egg water mixture.
an cheryl is going to mix it just so it 's slightly incorporated.
it 's OK, if it has a little bit of loan, so you do n't want to over mix it, you over.
mix it that you 're going to have a really tough gummy batter that 's perfect, perfect.
so what 's going to happen.
now is we 're going to take our batter.
and it 's a little.
it may look like a slightly running, but what 's important on a good is that you have a light batter because you do n't want to over.
quote , what you 're going to try it, so what i 'm going to do now is we 're going to take this item, the batter.
and we 're going to put in the refrigerator.
well , we prep all of our ingredients that were going to try and heat the oil, and that 's important.
because we 've just mix the flour and, flour and water make gluten and if we use it right now, i do n't have a tendency to be tougher.
so we want the thing to relax a little bit and then we 'll be good to go.
all right, in the face.
so what we 've done is, we 've made our batter, and we 've let it sit in the refrigerator.
so that eternal rest a little bit.
because we mixed it hard right, it was kind of.
so now we 're going to go ahead and start frying.
i have very clean oil.
i 'm using canola oil here.
and we 've got it to three hundred twenty degrees.
we 've got some shrimp.
i have a jumbo shrimp here that we 've butterflied and then on the base.
so along the bottom made little slits, and that will help keep them straight.
then we 've got all kinds of vegetables here and the key is to cut like hard vegetables.
like carrots or sweet potatoes, you want to cut him thin so that they can cook in the amount of time that it takes to fry the batter.
i 've got onions broccoli, we got some eggplants and she said she saw an.
we 've got she talking mushrooms.
so , let 's go ahead and get this thing started.
what 's this that is, okinawan sweet potato, so i 'm going to dip the, the shrimp in here.
i 'm going to slightly some of the excess come off, and i 'm going to go ahead and put in my oil.
i want to wiggle it just a little bit, as it kind of goes in there.
and it will start to feather out a little bit.
and then i 'll just let it go off with two shrimp in there for now, what, yeah, go ahead.
so i just, just call it even it and just put it inside, out.
do n't shake it too much?
'cause you are all the better to come off so we do a couple more pieces.
and there 's some pieces that take longer to cook.
so we should put it in first it 's, it 's more of a matter of just watching the time.
so , i mean, if you put something in that, takes longer to cook after it 's just, yeah, i 'm a product.
but one thing you do want to do is you want to keep track of your oil, you know, it 's convenient if you have one of those fried daddies.
it will keep track of the temperature using a public we 're doing here you want to make sure that the oil does n't get so.
hot , that is, burning the product report has a chance with quote.
and you do n't want to overcrowd the pan, either i think we 're kind of good right now.
and the shrimp will probably take maybe minute to cook, and is actually looking pretty good.
here someone put that over here.
i would think this is out here.
and then what happens we look i 'm not sure chopsticks champion.
so i 'm going to use my little faster here as you 're frying.
and you 're going to want to clean out the oil every so often because little pieces are going to want it they 're going to come up and you 're going to bits and i got some here a lot of it do you want to put that varnished stuff but there i put him in suits.
so we 're going to go ahead and keep trying cheryl is going to keep dipping and dropping.
and i 'll keep watching what 's going to happen here and then when we come back you 'll get to see all the finished product and then we get to supply that i like to do and that seat sounds great.
we right back.
wow , that was really easy.
so remind us.
what 's the secret to great template on OK.
here we go ice cold water really important.
make sure you do n't over mix the batter.
let it be a little bit lumpy and let it rest for a little bit, so that it 's not really sort of doing.
make sure your oil is three hundred twenty five degrees so that you 're not going to have a soggy oily product and eat it as quickly as possible.
serve them right away because you wanted to be hot.
and you want it to be crisp, so delicious for this recipe and more visit us at foodland dot com.
