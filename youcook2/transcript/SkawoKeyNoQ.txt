he walking longer i 'm debbie wrong.
and you 're watching debbie walls walking doll.
so it 's february which means valentine 's and i 'm sure all you guys out there are wanting to cook something romantic for your honey.
and when i think romantic i think french, so i 'm going to be making julia child 's classic book going on with a few debbie.
let 's get started.
now you guys watch the show a lot, and, you know, that i love to chop and drop meaning chop stuff up while things are cooking.
but with this particular dish, i highly recommend that you have everything cut up and ready to go before we even start cooking.
and that 's called knees on class that 's rich, step one, hold on.
you want to get a club dutch ovens you.
gotta get your cooking, vessel, on the stove.
i 'm using my tajine like i always do.
but you guys can use your look for save you have that or any sort of ceramic thing that can go straight into the oven.
so the big, it 's nice and brown.
now i 'm going to remove it from the next step.
is the beef.
now japan the meat has to be dry because it wo n't brown if it 's wet so to put the meat into a towel.
so remember at this point.
we 're just browning everything with brown, the bakery around the meat or going to brown the onions and brown the carrots trying to keep you guys up to date, so, they know, it 's a process.
the process like love yet put in the time you gotta put in the investment and.
in the end for fifty years later you 're, like wax, hopefully, there 's no regrets.
i have the oven at four twenty five right now super hard to pop it in their format as you can see.
it 's beautifully carmalized.
licenses lee everything smells amazing going to get even more amazing by adding some aromatics, please do n't use dried thyme.
make sure it 's relatively good wine OK.
i think the french one is to be matchy, matchy.
but you can do whatever, whatever you want alright.
now that the beef is in the oven, i 'm going to start with the.
next component of this dish, which is the pearl onions.
there is nothing more french than pearl onions.
let me tell you for this step, do n't be afraid to have the heat up high?
i know it 's crazy when it 's spitting at you and it 's making noises and stuff.
but you really want those mushrooms to brown mushrooms.
has a lot of moisture in them and they do n't brown very easily so jacked up that heat do.
it so the reason why this dish is perfect for valentine 's is.
because it 's, it 's in the oven for at least two hours, which gives you plenty of time.
to get yourself ready.
so that 's what i 'm going to do the gravy is a wonderful consistency, not too thick not too thin now from my debbie wong, touch dijon mustard.
now for all you hear is out there.
you may want to hide your eyes.
'cause untraditional, but i respected the dish kept it french.
and for me the mustard, as just that.
next level of sharp kick that i feel this dish really needs i must have some reason, not even kidding, you 're not even exaggerating, you know, this is not your typical romantic meal.
it 's not finicky.
it 's not like, you know, pile of this pile of that pile of that.
but you know, what to me it 's perfect, it 's got the right amount of refinement and classiness.
but it 's also got an awesome comfort food factor to me.
the perfect romantic dinner so that select you guys.
a valentine 's or anytime, you want investigators an appeal.
