hi , everybody, and welcome back to cook and cheer today in this episode we 're making up are really simple.
sandwich a BLT.
this is really popular.
you can find it in just about any restaurant in BLT stands for bacon, lettuce, and tomato, so let 's get started.
what i 'm gonna do is add some bacon to a preheated pan.
and of course, i 'm not going to use any oil with this.
because bacons greasy enough anyway, and i 'm going to try this.
so i 'd say for about four five minutes, just until it becomes nice and crispy of course it depends on you if you do n't want to krispy cut back the cooking time just a little bit.
so i 'm just going to remove this and set it aside on a plate line with a paper towel OK what i 've got here, is some toasted white bread.
so what i 'm going to do is lay a few strips of bacon over top of the bread?
now you can use brown bread or your favorite type of bread followed by a couple of slices of large ripe tomatoes.
the iceberg lettuce, of course, you can use romaine or your favorite type of lettuce, then on the second piece of toast.
i 'm going to apply a generous layer of male.
and if you 're not a male lover, you can simply leave this off season it, with some freshly ground pepper.
now i 'm going to place the top on slice it in half.
and you 're ready to serve and there you have it are simple but nevertheless, popular and delicious bacon tomato, and lettuce sandwich.
