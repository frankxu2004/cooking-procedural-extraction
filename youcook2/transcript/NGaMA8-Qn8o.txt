hi , my name is lila and welcome to my kitchen.
today , we are going to make a delicious singapore noodle dish.
now there are several different versions of singapore noodles that are out there.
my dish combines strip chick in and which is tossed with the noodles.
the rice stick noodles in A D licious semi sweet curry song.
so , let 's go ahead and get started on our singapore noodles.
now here i have may fun noodles an which are also called rice sticks, an what i 'm going to do is place them into a bucket of warm water just to soak for about fifteen minutes.
so here i have them in a bucket of warm water and you just want to make sure that their submerge under the water.
so that they can soften and i 'm just going to let them sit for about fifteen minutes and we can go ahead and prepare our other ingredients.
now here i have my shrimp an, i 'm using frozen precooked there already cleaned and deveined and their pre cooked shrimp and what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to go ahead and just pour some cool water over them and let them sit until they 're defrosted and then i am going to have to take the tails off and here i have my two large chicken breasts, which what i 'm going to do first is just remove all of the fact that i just want to go ahead and remove all of this back from our chick in like that an once are fat is removed from the chick in i 'm just going to go ahead and cut it into about one inch pieces.
so you want peace is just about this size an, once all your chicken is cut, you can just go ahead and place it into a container and then you want to just sprinkle the garlic salt on just like this, and then using your hands just mix it in, to make sure that it coats each piece and then once it 's coated with the garlic salt, we can go ahead an add are shushing wine and again use your hands to make sure that each piece is coated and as you can see this stir fry has just red pepper onion, yellow pepper, and some green pepper into the mix.
so i 'm just going to go ahead and microwave this on high for five minutes, an once are vegetables are MW we can go ahead and drain them in a calendar just like that, and then we could set them aside to be used in our noodles.
now here i have all the ingredients for my sauce and what i 'm going to do is i 'm just going to mix everything together i 'm going to put the brown sugar, and with this soy sauce and then the curry powder and our hot chili sauce and.
now what i want to do is i just want to stir until this forms a paste.
so i can just stir and mix everything up together until it forms a nice thick paste an once you have a paste, it should look just like this, and, that is, going to be the sauce for our noodles, an once are shrimp have defrosted what we want to do is we just want to go ahead and drain them in a calendar like that, and then we want to go ahead and pull off details.
so you can just go ahead and pull the tail zopf, just like that.
so you just want the talus shrimp that are already cooked.
so go ahead and do that OK an once your noodles have a kind of springy texture to them you want to just make sure they kind of break on their own, just like that and they 're kind of pliable then you can go ahead and rain them in the calendar as well, and once you return your noodles to the bowl you just want to toss them with a tablespoon of peanut oil just.
so that they do n't stick together an once our walk is hot, we can go ahead and add in our oil and let it get hot and once the oil is hot, we can just go ahead and add are chick in and we just wanna let it cook until it is lightly brown and once the chicken is lightly browned you can go ahead and remove it from the walk and just place it on a plate and set it aside, and then without wiping out the walk just go ahead and add your three tablespoons of peanut oil and, then you can go ahead and add in your noodles and just make some around, just.
so that they get hot and then we can go ahead and add in our sauce.
now this is a pace that you just want to make sure that you scrape it all out from your container to get it in there, good, and once we had in our sauce that we want to do is just pasta noodle to mix everything up thoroughly together we just want to top it.
so that the saw get into all of the noodles and what 's your noodles are thoroughly coated with the sauce you can go ahead and adding your shrimp and your vegetables and just tough everything together an once the shrimp and vegetables are hot an mixed in with the noodles you can go ahead and return the chick in into the lock and then just start a makes everything up together an once everything is thoroughly mixed then you can go ahead and remove the walk from the heat and once you remove your walk from the heat what we 're going to do is we 're just going to given a little extra boost of flavor and we 're going to add our second batch of our sauce just drizzling it on just like that, and again make sure 'cause it 's pasty, just want to get it all out of your container and then you just wanna go ahead and toss it around, just like this and again mixing in the sauce once again to coat each piece of meat and once these sauces completely mixed in then it is ready to serve , enjoy.
