a fifteen minute thai soup.
this is hot and sour chicken soup otherwise known as tom, young guy.
hi , this is jayden from steamy kitchen dot com, but so awesome about thai.
food is that they combine many different flavors in one bite.
there 's spicy sour, savory, sweet and in this soup recipe, it has all of those flavors together out of all the soups in thai cuisine this is probably the most popular soup this recipe is from everyday thai cooking by katy chin.
the first of these herbs is actually a leaf, this is cafe or lime leaf.
if you tear this leaf in just a small place and put it next to your nose.
oh , my goodness, of the fragrance of this cafe align.
leaf , it just smells the rome is just incredible tear.
the leaf in a few places just so it can release all of its flavors and aroma but do n't care the spine of the leaf.
this way stays whole.
there is so much flavor and aroma in the oils inside the leaf, and you want to make sure you expose that as much as possible.
the second special herb is lemongrass.
the lemongrass along with kaffir lime leaves together are quintessential herbs of southeast asian cuisine that give dishes a bright, sweet.
an herbaceous flavor in aroma to release the flavors of lemongrass.
you 're only going to use the last six inches of the stock believes of lemongrass, have nothing to do with flavor?
it 's all in the stock near the root.
most recipes will have you slice.
the lemongrass very, very thinly or in this case, bruise it.
so i like to cut it into smaller slices.
and then take the back of my knife and just kind of pounded a bit just to release all of the fibers to loosen the fibers and release its flavors and oils.
i 'm lucky enough to have in my growing in my garden.
both of these, however you can find them at that asian market.
and if you 're no one you 're in asian market.
here 's your substitution.
take a line and a vegetable peeler.
the line you 're going to use the line peel as a substitute for both kaffir lime leaf as well as lemongrass.
i like to bruise the lime.
leaf , a bit, as well, before i throw it into the stock this helps release the oils and the flavors in the, in the peel as well.
oh , i forgot to tell you.
i 'm using chicken stock as of the base add a few slices of fresh ginger and a couple slices of hot chili pepper, all of these aromatics are going to simmer with the chicken broth for about ten minutes, and then we 're going to scoop them out and discard them.
you might want to taste the soup right now if you like it a little more spicy add to keep the chili pepper it until just before serving.
and then you can remove everything so take a strainer and take out all of the aromatics, all of the flavor has been infused in the chicken broth already.
now we 're going to add the chick in this is boneless, skinless chicken thigh.
you can use breast if you want.
but i actually prefer chicken thigh in my soup, another very, very popular southeast asian seasoning is fish sauce.
there 's unfortunately no substitute for fish sauce from you can find fish sauce at most grocery stores, these days in the asian section here comes the sour part of the soup, this is freshly squeezed lying, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through.
and then that 's it.
i like to add fresh cilantro leaves in the soup, as well, and stir that in once the soup is done cooking there 's.
so many ways to personalize this soup you can use shrimp along with the chick in or just you shrimp.
instead , you can also make a vegetarian version by just using vegetable broth and instead of adding chicken breast meat and add more vegetables in also.
instead of using canned straw mushrooms use fresh thinly sliced mushrooms for the full recipe, or you have any questions at all.
