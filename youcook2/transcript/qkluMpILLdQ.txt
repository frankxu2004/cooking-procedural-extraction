i discovered this a few years ago.
this is called cannon.
and it 's a way to make sure that potatoes are about his elevated as you could make him super, super easy, this is a really old irish recipe for my pants are hot and is this cocaine and is what it means is white headed cabbage in irish gaelic or one of 'em and it 's traditionally served on salad, and i hope i 'm pronouncing that right it 's the day after halloween if i 'm not somebody told me.
but it 's really easy let me show you, how you do it.
now back here i 've got about two, two and a half pounds of irish potatoes, and i 'm just sending them off over here i 've got about half a pound bacon, an out of the pan that i did the bacon in i break out all of the grease about two cups of shredded cabbage that 's gonna go right in, here and i do n't want to stir fry or saute it actually want to fairly steam it my time is about to go off.
so i 'm getting a little bit of water this is it 's going to get all the little balcony stuff off the bottom without the grease, and i do n't want to let it go.
so long that it gets soggy i just want to get a little bit tender.
so i 'm going to cover this up back here just to get hot cover cream this is not, no, you know, we, you know, we like our own prison and we 've got a cup of better.
now in ireland and this is what the best thing when they service they serve it family style, and they put in the middle and they put a hole in the center of the potatoes and they filled out with melted butter and the whole deal is that you 're supposed to take a fork for the potatoes and dip it in melted butter yeah, that 's a good start OK.
now my potatoes are almost done i got my cabbage sitting here going to steam for probably five or six minutes potatoes are done, and i 'm letting the cream in the butter get warm and kind of, come together i 'm going to drain the saaf and come right back and i 'll show you how super easy this is how i really, really did all right SU steam valve on potatoes and then when i put them back into the warm hot, put it back into the hot pot.
because it helps dry them off i threw in the cream and the butter that i have melted back here i have the cabbage right here that i 've given just a few minutes you still want some texture and some crunch to it when i crunch, bite, i guess.
so that coming right over here into the pot now, i would like to do the green onions that go in here these are tiny they got very mild flavor.
so i do n't like to cook him if you want to, if you want to software flavor, go ahead and throw them in the pot with the cabbage for the last couple minutes, and then right in there, and if you add the cream of the butter and it 's a little too dry say about some of the potato cooking water and use that.
but then if you do that, watch the salt.
because it will be two salty if you 're not careful.
so by pepper.
so all, i 'm doing is going to match this up transfer it over there and get ready to show you what will probably be your new favorite comfort food alright.
now i had said, the whole family stable thing, unfortunately, i 'm here all by myself i do n't care there.
we go you gotta love over the top ridiculous, and i think this defines it little bit of green onion.
little bit cabbage little bit of bacon and right into the melted butter thinking removed.
ireland , yeah, no, not that.
