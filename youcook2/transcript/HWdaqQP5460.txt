today on how tightly chilly we 're making compact full or crab fried rice.
so it decaf welcome to hot thai kitchen today, we 're making something very simple, and super delicious.
we 're making compact or fried rice, which is one of those stable lunch items in thailand.
now count means, writes an means to stir fry.
so it 's a very simple translation there.
but specifically we 're making compact boo or crab fried rice, which is one of my favorite and most popular variation.
but you can do cowpat move with court chicken or carpet with.
so it 's completely up to you, so let 's get started.
and this dish i have here one and a half cup of cooked white rice pack it down when you measure it by weight it 's about nine and a half ounces.
now , i 'm using here.
jasmine rice, which is the one that we normally eat in thailand, and it 's important to use jasmine rice.
because it actually has a unique fragrance, even when it 's wrong when you open a bag of jasmine risers that beautiful, floral smell that you can unique from other kinds of rice the most important thing about rice with fried rice is that it cannot be over cook too much water in it.
because you will then get mushy, fright rice.
so the rice has to be cooked through.
but the grange of maintain integrity, it should n't be it should n't look like it 's bearsted or the edges are starting to kind of get a little bit soft.
an i cook this rice yesterday.
it 's actually better to do fried rice or not better, with easier to do fried rice with cold rice.
because the grains separate more easily and they do n't send a clump up this much short grain rice will not work for this.
because they tend to be a little sticky and long super long greenlink bus, marty rice is not quite as fluffy.
so jasmine rice is perfect for this.
so that we got that other, than that there 's not a lot of prep to do four cloves of garlic already chopped and we 've gotten one green onion cut into rounds.
now if you 've got if you 've got a green onion that 's really fat in the white part make sure you 're running horizontally across this way otherwise you get big chunks of green onion in your mouth and that 's not fun and then seasoning every type cook has their own version of salting agent for fried rice every most people agree on soy sauce.
but i 've seen every combination out there with fish sauce oyster sauce solve golden mountain sauce so, i 'm giving you my version, which is n't to say that it 's the correct one or anything is just the one that i like best.
so we 've got two teaspoons of soy sauce and one teaspoon of fish sauce.
now let 's talk about soy sauce a little bit.
this is a recipe where if you can get your hand on thai soy sauce it will actually make a difference, not all soy sauces are created equal thai chinese japanese soy sauce is all differ in flavor and color my version is lighter in both color and flavor and in my opinion, and i 'm a little bit biased.
it 's a little more fragrant.
and we call this CU cow, or literally white soy sauce.
no , it 's not white, but it 's named to contrasts you dumb or black.
slaves on which is a thicker darker sweeter version.
so if you ca n't find this i 'm using healthy boyfriend, you can use any sort of light soy sauce alright.
so that 's that for seasoning other than that i 've got three ounces or about eighty five grams of dungeness crab, making use frozen or canned or whatever this is fresh or any other type of protein if using raw protein like chicken or pork i like to marinate it a little bit with soy sauce.
so it has some flavor, and we 've got one egg some white pepper and half a teaspoon of sugar and that 's pretty much it.
let 's go to the stuff.
so i 've got here a couple of tablespoons of vegetable oil in a nonstick pan.
if you got a walk, right i do n't, well, not one that would work with this stuff.
anyway , so, once that oils hot, you can add in some garlic OK now.
if you 're using raw protein, which were not today.
but if you are using, raw protein once the garlic starts to turn a little bit brown the smallest bit search turned brown.
that 's when you want to add your raw protein.
cook it to sixty percent, then accurate.
but we 're using cooks, protein.
so we 're going to add that with the rice so the smallest bit of garlic has groups.
carol brown, they 're going to break the yolk let it set for a little bit, do n't scramble it right away?
and when it 's said a little bit ramble, gent late now, you want to scramble it gently and not right away.
because otherwise you 're existe turns into complete mush, you still kind of want is this OK.
now that you 've got X on whatsapp.
you 're going to go in with the rice, break it down a little bit, he called rice breakdown easier with the crab.
break it down, give it a quick talk.
then you 're going to go in with a seasoning fish sauce and soy sauce.
already in here half a teaspoon of sugar a little bit of sweetness to cut the salt couple of dash of white pepper source of heat.
and now you 're just going to cook it until all the rice is heat up.
and the sauce is been thoroughly.
distribute it now.
i 'm using cold rice, but if you have hot right, it does n't mean that you ca n't use it in restaurants.
we use hot rice all the time.
'cause there 's no sense keeping a whole another set of cold rice.
it just becomes a little bit harder.
you need more attention and breaking it apart.
let it sit for a little bit source.
so i 've got it on medium high heat this week and final thoughts.
and then that 's pretty much done.
if you are not sure if it 's done, you can just steal it.
libya finger to see if it 's hot if all the rice is in hot, and if it is go into the green onion you want to add cilantro to this go for it and that 's done just go over there and put.
OK , so this feed me twice.
but for big growing boys probably more like one large portion.
let 's do this.
but now it 's not over you want to serve this always with a web to climb anti only cutline, weekend like this we do n't cut moon which is, it 's actually easier to grip and squeeze like there goes lime.
some cucumber, and it 's the cucumbers a nice palate cleanser.
actually does this kind of heavy, so i 'm using a julienne, peeler which is great for papaya salad, just do a couple of fuse decoratively.
you do n't have to do this, of course, i 'm just trying to make it nice couple of slices right here.
and then i 'm going to show you how i like to eat this squeeze a.
lime , all over and the acid in the line, really cuts the salt and the oil and makes this that much more delicious, some chili powder.
i 'll pick both person.
he and my favorite condiment creek number, blah.
now i 've got a whole video on thai condiments so you can go and check those out if you like.
but this is a mixture of thai chilies fish sauce and, or some lime chopped.
garlic , whatever a little bit extra, and makes everything up together.
and we 're ready to eat, so i 'm going to go and eat now.
