welcome back to my show.
they see aroma, and this is a continuous from my daughter videos.
so the batter which i showed you all in my last video, and, if you have n't seen it, you can go back and see how the battery is done.
this is how the batter looks an.
it 's all formatted and ready to go now.
i told you that this battle need some solved before you make that those.
but i 'm not going to take salt and mix it in the whole battle, because that 's rude.
you 're bad or so what i 'm going to do is.
i 'm going to remove some of the in this smaller container.
i have an.
i 'll just use exactly what i need for my, for my doses.
so i 'm separating some batter in here and then i 'm going to add just enough salt in there.
what i need so in this about this much salt is OK and then i 'm going to just mix this batter up.
and , that is ready for my daughter, so, let 's go ahead and make some dosers.
now i have my fry pan and buy yourself a non stick.
it definitely helps, i 've got that on medium high for about a minute and all minute.
two minutes, what i 'm going to do is i want to make sure that the temperature is exactly right.
so what you 're doing is sprinkling some cold water on it, have yourself a small tall pickup?
spoonful of this, and just spread this on your pan to the size.
you need, and once you have done that go ahead and put the cover on it, so that those are steams.
and makes a nice crisp from the top and the bottom.
the daughter is out, so we 're going to do a second one here again.
sprinkle water or less.
and , then wipe it off.
you have a nice clean on fry pan.
take one of this saturday and just spread it, see how easily it spreads the spread.
there , we go that 's a perfect spread there, and then we 'll go ahead and cover this up.
and if you would like playing those are here.
you would just spring a sport that oil other basic he, and credit chris from the bottom and you can remove it, folded or remove it like that.
and that would be your plane.
those are so.
now what i 'm looking at since about a minute or.
so i 'm looking some ground specs on my daughter, and that i know, is, is ready to be removed that cover?
you can see how nicely it has fluffed up and the whole 's, you know, those are what you 're looking for i 'm using basic here.
feel free to use the oil.
if you want just sprinkle, some on this, and then i 'm going to take about a tablespoon of my potato filling, which i made father doze off, and i 'm going to just set it right in the center there may be a little more there.
right in the center and then i 'm going to cover this again for about you know, out, said ten seconds, or so, 'cause i 'm still waiting on that to turn little more nice and brown and the basic he can nicely mold in it.
and once that is done, OK, so i think it 's ready to come out and what you do is, you just take this those.
i see how it 's leaving the sides or not, and that 's the technique.
what you use for spraying the water on off and just go ahead and close this.
those up, so we 're going to close it from one side and then close it from the other side and just take it out in, in a plate.
so that 's your dozer which has come out again for watching DC aroma.
