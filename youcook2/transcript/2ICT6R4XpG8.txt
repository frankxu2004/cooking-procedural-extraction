tonight we 're going to make some old jingle.
bogey or some squidboy basically want to pan fry.
some squid with spicy sauce on it, but it 's gonna be nice big pieces, i have here two tablespoons of red pepper paste or coach.
john , i have two tablespoons of soy sauce.
i have two tablespoons of sugar.
i have one tablespoon of rice wine.
this one sake the japanese one not really korean.
but , you know, you can get soggy in korea, too.
i have one tablespoon of sesame E oil, one tablespoon of sesame E seeds, two tablespoons of green onion.
i have half a tablespoon of garlic and a quarter, half a teaspoon of garlic and a quarter teaspoon of ginger that 's been mixed up.
but i 'm going to make this up alright.
let 's prep are squid, and i got i bought clean tube.
these are already the skins off of him.
there 's no all the guts are out.
these are easy to work with.
will it take good?
now we 'll take this side and i know scored with a knife.
now i will turn it around.
almost scored this way so now it looks like a mango and we 're going to cut it like this pieces about like that OK.
i have both my squid tubes, cut up what i 'm gonna do, is i 'm gonna take my sauce?
and i 'm just going to pour it on here will let this marinate for about five, ten minutes.
OK , my fans getting hot with a little oil in.
here they almost start put in this D O jingle or squid in there and i 'm going to try to put it the scored side down easy to be hotter now when it tries to curl up we 're going to flip it over now squid cooked pretty.
quick , so it does n't take long to cook.
there 's a little cooked on when we get both sides cook want to take him off.
cook him too long will start to get tough.
and we do n't want that you look at it probably about two minutes per side and just keep moving around in the sauce and just keep at them.
all right, all of our squid is cooked now.
and we 're going to do lipstick all the sauce, and put in the pan.
and we 're going to give the old jingle one final costs with that.
now it 's all caramelizing nice to sweet dick.
OK , is always the question, is how does it taste, taste good to maine.
