it 's a korean dish called bebop, and it 's this great mixture of rice and tons of veggies and meat.
all mixed together with spicy red pepper paste, and it is delicious now.
if you seen some my videos before you know that i am currently learning korean, and actually one of my favorite things about korea is food.

and i 'll show you how to make feeding.
but first things, first prepared sushi rice or any kind of short grain rice according to package instructions, let it cook while you work on the meat and veggies thinly.
slice three medium steaks or buy.
it pre sliced if you can add to close.
finally , chopped garlic, two tablespoons low sodium soy sauce, a splash of sesame E oil in a medium pinch of dark brown sugar, mix everything together and let it sit in the fridge, while you prepare the veggies first thinly slice six ounces of shit talky mushrooms, then thinly sliced three ounces of baby carrots cut a large zucchini into three parts sliced lengthwise and cut into matchsticks will be adding some baby spinach later.
but there 's no need to cut it.
now to cook the meat heat about a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large pan over medium high heat at the meat and all the marinade as well cook stirring frequently until the meat is browned and cooked through then suddenly decide covered with foil and add the mushrooms to cook in the juices to the mushrooms add one tablespoon low sodium soy sauce a splash of sesame E oil in a pinch of dark brown sugar, cook until brown, and softened set aside to drain on paper towels and cover to keep warm.
the carrots with a half teaspoon salt, a bit of sesame E, oil and a half tablespoon of honey again cook until softened and set aside on paper towels to drain off excess oil and keep them covered before we cook the zucchini.
i 'm going to deglaze the pan to get rid of all those bark bits to do this.
you can use some kind of wine or so do like i 'm using here turn off the heat and add a splash.
then use your spatula to loosen the burn pits since these are just burnt.
and we do n't want them to discover the zucchini will just wipe the pan at the paper towel and add a bit of fresh oil now.
turn the heat back to medium, high and cook the zucchini with a half teaspoon salt until soft and set beside.
like the other veggies covered in on paper towels to drain.
now add six ounces baby spinach to the panth, plus one tablespoon low sodium soy sauce, and one clove finely chopped garlic cook until the spinach is wilted.
but still green and then set aside on paper towels to drain finally for each person fry, an egg, sunnyside up with a pinch of salt before we assemble the beating.
but be sure to grab some good to join in K, red pepper paste to add as well.
