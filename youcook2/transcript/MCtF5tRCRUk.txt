hi , i 'm youtube donald skiing.
and i hear you 're looking for a great breakfast recipe.
here 's a doozy eggs.
benedict is an absolute classic brunch recipe, and it is comprised of toasted english muffins.
beautiful sharpen bottery, hollandaise sauce and creamy, poached eggs and a little bit of savory ham as well, it is simple to make.
but you need to take time and concentrate.
i have two eggs in a large heatproof bowl.
give them a good twist off.
and we 're going to stick these over a pan of simmering water.
so as this simmers away and starts to heat up we 're going to add one or two knobs of butter and slowly.
but surely into our sauce.
we 're going to add more butter in.
and you kind of have to keep doing it and keep going, and you 'll notice that the sauce starts to thicken up under the heat or over the heat, and it 's just a case of adding more and more butter until you have a nice voluptuous sauce.
so i 'm adding my final little bit of butter in here.
and once that 's melted down, we have a fantastic hollandaise sauce that just needs a kick of flavor from some lemon juice and some sea salt.
i 'm going to take it off the heat at this point.
give this a lost quicc through and you can see how beautiful and yellow that hollandaise sauce is.
it just needs to be hit with a tiny touch of lemon juice, give that lemon and limited of a roll under the board, an quick squeeze, only needs about a teaspoon of lemon juice, and if you 're doing this, squeezing us straight in do, do it through your hands.
so you get any of those tips left?
that should do me little hit of some sea salt in.
here will make all the difference in terms of flavor that a bit of black pepper in there.
but i do n't think purists would be too happy given a last little risk through it should maintain that thickness.
even when you add the lemon juice and that my friends is a very delicious and simple hollandaise sauce set this aside.
we need to talk about are poaching liquid for our eggs.
i have this come to a rolling simmer, and you do n't want it to be a really hard boil.
you want it to be a nice steady simmer.
keep it on a low temperature.
we 're adding a tablespoon of white wine vinegar is that a tablespoon of white wine vinegar and the pinch of salt are going to add now, will make all the difference to bringing your poached eggs together?
the rested i use is slightly different because normally everyone goes in there and swirls around.
i 'm destroying it very gently to dissolve the salt, but i do n't actually swirled my water.
i just popped my egg in very gently because it is poached eggs or something that not everyone gets right.
so this is my little trick, and it 's the way i always make my poached eggs.
it 's always a very simple one.
an even if you 've never posted before i hope i can guarantee will work for you.
so in a little cult bring your cup right to the edge of the water and just drop it on it.
OK my egg is hot.
it 's time and there is a tendency.
when they committed the water that they look a little bit miserable.
so if you have these little extra bits that are emphasized just use a butter knife and chop it off.
so you have a nice edge to your lovely post, it fantastic got my poached eggs, got my hollandaise, and.
now it 's time to assemble, i have some toasted english muffins.
and we 're going to just assemble these up with a little bit of ham and the bottom.
here i 've got nice thinly sliced pieces of ham, and they really do add a little savory kick.
so i always use ham, but you can do it with smoked salmon, you can add a little bit of cooked spinach in here is quite nice as well.
so really this is a recipe you can adapt to your own liking, but this is more of the classic way of serving.
if so, we 've got a nice little bit of ham and now it 's time for our fantastic poached eggs, straight on top with your poached eggs.
beautifully poster, that you have that running yolk and nicely set and quite just lift very gently on top and what brings together this whole dish is that hollandaise sauce.
so the last little bit through just so that is, nice and ready i 'm going to lose my wisc.
take a big spoon.
where is my little small spoon?
in this case and just read that over the top and look at fantastic flavors really sharp hollandaise sauce and when you dive through that egg yolk your own business.
the only thing this needs now is a little fresh hit of some chives over the top and is going to give them a quick snip with the scissors.
i 'm kind of going a little bit creative here now.
but i quite like that just a nice little.
snip gives you all that wonderful sort of onion flavor and you could give it final touch of some black pepper and then that my friends is a serious breakfast and a half.
i 'm going to give it that little crack.
the last thing to do now is slice right through that, so you get really nice.
and i 'm going to get you to come in and have a look at this, oh, yes, this is like your eggs.
benefit is all about dripping egg.
yolk wonderful hollandaise sauce and that savory ham.
they just give you porn that has to be one of my absolute favorite breakfast that i now have all over my hand.
