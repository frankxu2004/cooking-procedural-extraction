hey , everybody this is to take out diet also known as word dietze, go to die.
and today on the shell will be making our version of the taco bell bean burrito now.
let me tell you, i have never willingly ordered a taco bell bean burrito.
it is so mushy and textureless that it just does n't do it for me.
but you can end up with a bean burrito two ways you 're horribly broken.
you have to order it off of the value menu or horribly drunk you mumble, inaudible words to your sober driver, of course, OK, she 'll have a bean burrito and even in your drunkenness state.
you 're like no, i said.
why did we go to chipotle, and it 's because chipotle is n't open?
it three four five, maybe six in the morning do n't judge anyway.
today , we 're going to make it because it is fibrous.
an maybe i need to poop, you know, who knows just saying.
let 's get started start by starting your big part of cook ten servings.
because i am not showing you how to make that.
but this team, are flour tortilla in the microwave for thirty seconds if you have whole wheat flour tortillas, perfect if you have a steamer that 's even better.
but going to cover my flour tortilla and wet paper towels and microwave it for thirty seconds place it on a large plate and then pour on your serving of pinto beans.
then , taco bell says, they use a tanky red sauce.
what the heck is a tag arrest us.
i asked my sister, and she 's like is that sour, sweet, tanky red stuff at the asian restaurant.
no , no, no, no, no, it 's not that pretty sure, it 's not that.
but i still do n't know what it is.
so we 're going to add on a little bit of catch up in a little bit of saracho sauce together and hope for the best.
lastly , we 're going to add on our onions in our chatter.
i use dia chatter tizan honestly.
i only use a little bit because it tastes funny.
now how do you rap up a burrito.
you may ask are not whatever.
take the site of the tortilla, closest to you.
it , over this stuff took that in under the stuff and then fold in both sides.
you could fold a ministrat if your amateur, but i bought mine in at a triangular angle and into another folder and then roll it.
the rest of the way towards the other side, opposite of you now we can eat it.
despite my preconceived notions actually taste good, i thought i would take one bite and just start to involuntarily gag.
but i believe took a second bite.
it was really good that i achieved was pretty good i cook really well, and then i ran into the saracha sauce.
now i do n't eat hot stuff that often i put on a little bit of a lot of saracho sauce.
so it is hot it is hot.
so i will add less next time.
that 's how you learn life lessons, you know, you do something you feel pain.
you do n't do it the next time, but overall it was really good.
no harsh words about the bean burrito from me.
i like pinto beans, i just wish i had a little bit more crunch in a little bit more, chris.
