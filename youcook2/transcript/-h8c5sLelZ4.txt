let 's do it.
i 've got a pan here and let 's start off with a little bit of sunflower oil, but you can use any oil.
you like as that happens the heats, up, and the drop in a bailiff little bit of cinnamon stick a few khuman seeds wanna.
very gently roast them as that, well, just get sought their release all their wonderful flavors.
at this point we 're going to add a little bit of chopped ginger and garlic.
nice and chunky days, not using like a base today, as does some chopped onion.
i 'm using a white onion as you can see.
but go ahead and used i read now brian lamb.
i 've got some loud here, which is absolutely beautiful.
it 's really tender sub beautiful cuts, and i cut it.
nice and small.
at this point longer, i 'd like a teaspoon of banana little touch with chili powder, just a little bit of coriander powder and this one teaspoon here i 've got up to merick audi now.
let 's just mix it around like i say this is a medium heat.
we 're not going to go crazy on this because although my meat is incredibly link, and so, on the onions and spices to burn so nice, and gently.
does it this cook this for about five minutes for supplies minutes keep stirring it.
i 'll be back them OK.
that 's coming along absolutely beautifully.
i said a little such a sort of this point, i 'm also going in with some fresh green chili, entirely up to you.
how much you put in.
now i 've got some chopped tomatoes look like a cut up tomatoes there, finally, chuck just leave them on the stop, no need to mix them in right now.
still , on the medium heat, i 'm just going to cover this come back in about four minutes.
what should happen into tomatoes, will start to breakdown?
that 's what 's going to create our gravy or messila source in a moment, OK, let 's take a look.
i learn to be plenty of it.
now we 're going to give this a mix now.
quite a lot of juice or water came out of my smart, as if yours are not so juicy you could add a little bit of water.
add a little bit as you can see there.
breaking down nicely, what i 'm gonna do now just have a little touch of dara, masala powder.
we 're going to put this on a simmer now, then they write down with the lid off lyrics, steam out a little bit.
but it drives just a little bit more.
i 'll be back in about five or six minutes as you can see this is reduced somewhat and it 's second.
and we 've now got an amazing soup, i mean, really lovely lamb carry-on messila, there.
it 's just really good that land.
like i say was a really high-quality if you 've got a kind of mutton, which is a bit tougher you have to cook it a bit longer, hope you enjoy that we see you again soon.
