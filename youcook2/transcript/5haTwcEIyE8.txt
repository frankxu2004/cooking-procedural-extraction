i do n't know what it is about the monsoons.
but it just makes me crave crispy and crunchy food.
and that 's why i love onion rings.
but what i do n't like about them is just how greasy.
the fried ones can be which is why my version is baked, but do n't worry.
it 's just as crispy and crunchy as the fried once i 'm going to start.
i 've already cut the onions into nice half inch down and.
now i 'm going to make the batter and to make a nice thick batter two tablespoons of corn flour here.
and i 'm going to add half a cup of all purpose flour.
OK , so i 'm just going to give it a good mix and what i 've got here, is one cup of buttermilk?
it 's going to give a nice tangy flavor to the onion rings when they 're ready and do this mixture, i 'm just going to add half of the buttermilk and just we skip really rigorously.
it 's going to look lumpy.
and you think that you 've done something wrong.
but just hang on this is going to come together in moments now add the rest of the buttermilk and just we skipped if you have no lungs left.
just work it slightly.
it 's a bit of an arm workout, but it 's working just put that aside, and we wanted the crumbs now.
so what i 've got here are panko bread crumbs and going to just season them with salt pepper be generous with these seasonings 'cause this is.
what will give it all of that flavor and because it 's me?
and you should know this by now that i will always add just a little bit of paprika just give that a good mix.
OK , so now i 've got the better and the crumbs nice and seasoned, and now it 's time to just start putting the onion rings together.
i 've got my oven, preheating to two twenty degrees.
celsius and this baking tray is lined with parchment paper, just dump this in the batter and use a separate hand to coat it with the bread crumbs.
keep the tail on the judgment and just make sure you use.
either separate hands or separate folks or tongues to do this.
you do n't want the same hand going into the batter and the cramps just keep lining the baking tray with these onion rings.
we 're just fifteen minutes away from eating crispy crunchy baked onion rings, half way through the baking time to tape the trees and flip the onion rings.
so that they cook evenly on both sides guys.
i promised you crispy and crunchy judge for yourself, so, but.
