whole time he boy he the pirates the hives are callie, oh, hi, i 've been star from masterchef season, two, and i did n't see you there.
today is saint.
i ca n't do an irish accent worth, a crap.
but in fact today is saint patrick 's stick, a lot of people do n't realize the same patrick 's day is actually an irish american holiday.
if they do n't celebrate it in ireland the way that we do here, and in fact, i 'm sorry to tell you this boston.
but australia is saint patricks.
day puts our saint.
patrick 's day absolutely to shame at any rate today.
is the day when i try to prepare as many of my favorite authentic as possible, and in my household, that means call?
ken and cocaine is a traditional irish dish that 's made with kale and potatoes, and it 's traditionally eaten with some type of pork today.
i 'm going to teach you the way.
i do cocaine and which i substitute purple cabbage for cal.
and i add all sorts of bacon and delicious pork fat into the mix.
it 's going to be absolutely delicious.
OK , let 's get started.
first step i 've got two and a half pounds of russet potatoes that have been sliced about that thick.
maybe about an inch or so unpeeled, and i 'd like to do that because the peel adds extra flavor and texture.
an also increases the nutrition of the recipe, tuna half pounds is about eight medium size potatoes and i 'm going to put them into my pressure cooker, along with about five clothes of garlic chopped up anna couple water.
now if you do n't have a pressure cooker, do n't worry you can click your potatoes anyway?
all you 're doing at this point is making garlic mashed potatoes so you can cook in the microwave.
you can boil them, you can steam them roast them every you want to do that to make you and a half pounds potatoes.
and i just like to do it in my pressure cooker because it takes eight minutes which is very fast.
and it also retains a lot more of the nutrition next step bacon.
now in ireland, this was probably made more frequently with the cheaper cuts of the pig basic pork belly pork jowl hocks smoked hocks and things like that.
now pork belly is probably the best meat to get for vulkan in my opinion.
but could n't find any at the grocery store, they were all out.
so i just grab some of the center cut bacon.
i 've got a little bit less fasten.
it a little bit more lean so it 's going to be a bit meatier, and i 'm going to render all of that fat.
if the visit bacon crispy, should have chopped it up here?
my past iron skillet.
i will cooking with cast iron if you have n't learned this from my other videos.
throw away your nonstick pans.
you cannot cook good on nonstick pans cast iron was invented centuries ago.
it is still the best form of cooking pan available, known to man time and it always will be.
it 's cheap and only requires a little bit more maintenance and care than regular non stick pans.
so go get yourself some used ones at a thrift store and start improving your cooking today.
now , while that bacon is cooking, and chop up ahead of red cabbage and you do n't have to wash tablets, just remove the outer couple of three layers of leaves and discard them and you 're good to go.
i like to use red cabbage over the traditional tail in this recipe first of all because of the color.
i really love that beautiful red color, and also.
because it has a little bit crunchier, meatier texture, and i really like a coal cannon that 's got lots of good texture running through it.
then this bacon is nice and crispy.
go ahead and pull it out.
but the slotted spoon.
but reserve that fat eight minutes in the pressure cooker an my potatoes are nice and tenderness.
so fast so.
now i 'm going to match them with a stick of butter and about half a cup of heavy cream.
now a word about mashed potatoes you 'll see, i 'm actually using a measure for several years.
i put them into my kitchen aid, and i whipped them to death until they were light and fluffy.
but what i discovered after working on master chef is that the texture of mashed potatoes when you whip them and overwork them becomes kind of glee and sticky and i was accustomed to that being the texture.
i should expect.
but it turns out that when you just likely match them, you get a much fluffier extra to them.
so you just a masher or a fork.
if you 've got a potato ricer, which is like a giant garlic press that presses the map that gives you the best texture of all.
but do n't get in there with your immersion blender or your hand mixer or put them in your stand mixer.
because it is going to absolutely ruin and the beautiful fluffy texture.
those potatoes, and now i have a bowl of beautiful, fluffy mashed potatoes.
this is the time to season them with salt and pepper.
now i 'm going to add ahead of shop.
red cabbage to the bacon pass.
now , now that takes up a lot of space.
so it 's going to fill your skillet.
but eighty percent of cabbages water and air and all of those little air pockets inside the cabbage or going to collapse and.
so this is going to reduce by half fairly quickly, then give yourself a little bit of salt to the cabbage, while it 's cooking and a splash of vinegar.
i 'm just going to use apple cider vinegar right now.
video goes really, well with cabbage.
really do not want to over cook the cabbage though overcooks.
cabbage taste disgusting it takes like a dead skunk, and you really do n't want to be eating dead skunk for dinner.
i do n't think so, you 're just going to cook it until the point that it 's wilted, and still has some good crunch to it, and, that is as far as you 're going to take it.
now when your cabbage is slightly cooked.
but still, crispy.
and go at it to your potatoes along with a bunch of chop scallions or green onions and all that delicious bacon you cooked earlier stir that together, and you 've got cole cannon that is n't that beautiful of this wonderful colors and textures like a potato salad on steroids.
and that is how you make my version of the classic irish dish, right, that is a good plate of food, you can serve a big old helping us as the main and only course, you can serve it as a side dish to some grilled sausages, or something yummy like that, a pork roast that 's great crunchy bacon crunchy cabbage, fresh bite from those green onions that 's fantastic for the full recipe, hit my website ben start dot com thanks for watching have a great saint patrick 's day.
