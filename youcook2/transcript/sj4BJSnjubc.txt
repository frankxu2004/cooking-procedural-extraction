hey , what 's going on everyone.
i 'm going to show you how to make a bean burrito.
you can also add chicken.
i got some chicken here.
so it 's super easy.
ingredients are black beans kind of refried beans, you got some chopped onion.
we have some cold.
we moderate jack shredded cheese.
we have some flower tortillas, burrito size is big, big tortillas.
we have some sarrah, cha.
if you want a little bit hotter and chicken, i did mention that already, so anyway.
let 's get this mixed up.
and i 'll show you how to put them together.
first step, we took the black beans and we rinse them off and put him in a bowl.
next we have are refried beans and we 're going to the spoon this out into oneness chunk we 're going to put this in the microwave and heat this up.
but then we 're going to mix it together.
so stay tuned, well i heat this up OK we 've had this up in the microwave for like a minute and a half.
so now we 're going to spoon this sunday or shells, and go from there to here is our flour, tortilla we 're going to put our bean mixture right in the middle.
next we 're going to put a little bit of onion and this is all totally up to you we 're going to add some chick in and god quarter cup, or maybe a little less of cheese and then to fold a burrito just bringing the sides like this folded over tuck it in and that maps what you read it looks like.
so we 're going to make a whole bunch of those.
so here 's another optional step you can eat the burritos just as is.
but we 're going to fryman in a little bit of butter.
so we 're just going to take a couple of tablespoons of butter and put in the pan.
but it melt, we 're going to fly him up kay.
now we 've got her butter melted.
so we 're going to just toss these in a couple at a time and let them fry up small medium big.
so you guys wo n't time out right i do n't want chicken beans, and cheese cano seven tony, generally take a bite what does have to do it.
now it 's really good to turn halt hot through the cheese in their house who 's better well everybody.
