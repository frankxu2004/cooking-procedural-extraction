the great thing about making minestrone is you can use any veggies that you have on hand and today, i 'm using the usual suspects.
i 'm just going to pack up the pan at a ted of olive oil and then we saute the celery in lake in the pan until it 's lovely and soft.
then add garlic carrot and potato and cook.
until it 's nicely quoted an heated through this is all nicely coated.
we 're going to add a tablespoon of tomato paste for great depth of flavor and give it a stir for about a minute to cook off that tomato paste flavor to make this minestrone even easier.
you can buy all the ingredients on line and have them home delivered.
now i 'm adding a can of diced ozzy tomatoes and now.
it 's time to add the chicken stock.
one later a bully selects chicken stock in chicago and half a cup of water, and we 're going to bring this to the boil for about ten minutes.
the great thing about soup is you can make double the batch and freeze some for later the minestrone 's been boiling for ten minutes now.
so i 'm going to add the pastor.
now you can use any path to you like, but i 'm using macaroni.
and i 'm only adding half a car because you do n't want to dominate the whole deer shit.
really swells up.
and we 're just going to let this cook for about eight minutes until it 's just al dente.
so the pastor is just perfectly.
we 're just going to add some cannellini beans.
there 's been rinsed and drained.
then i 'm adding some finely shredded kale and some green beans.
now we do this at the end because we just want to heat them through.
so , stir them in.
and you want to cook the beans until they 're bright, green and still crunchy.
and this will be ready in two minutes.
and that 's dinner done.
we 're ready to serve, look at that packed full of goodies.
so great way to get kids to eat veggies.
so now we 're just going to shoot it up with just a little bit of cracked, black pepper sprinkle of fresh parsley, and of course, i shaving of parmesan.
