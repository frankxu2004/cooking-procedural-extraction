hi guys, and laura betali on this episode of lauren, the kitchen.
i 'm going to show you how to make tomato soup.
it has been requested so many times here and learn the kitchen.
so i figured hey, i 'm in the mood for tomato soup.
so let me show you how to make it.
now let 's go with ingredients.
so we can get started.
you need some fresh tomatoes, chopped onion chicken stock.
these are some italian peeled tomatoes, garlic salt, pepper extra virgin olive oil.
and you 're going to get a few extra ingredients, which i 'll get into when the time comes.
so for now, the first thing to do is the oven.
forget it to four twenty, five.
what i 'm going to do is roast my tomatoes.
i like my tomato soup to have some fresh tomatoes in them.
these tomatoes are not that fabulous and suites.
so , what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to roast them to bring out natural sweetness in tomatoes.
and it gives you like a really sort of sweet, roasted tomato flavor that i think it 's amazing in this recipe.
so cut them in half look at this close to me.
and you can use any tomatoes that you want.
i 'm using just some regular just like plum tomatoes.
but that 's what i found, but they 're not that sweet.
so this is really going to help with bringing out the sweetness so salty.
and i 'm going to add one morning greeting.
with i did n't have out the little bit of balsamic.
vinegar , balsamic vinegar is going to breakdown ann really give the tomatoes a beautiful carmalized color, which i love so toss everything together.
i 'm going to put them, cut side down.
i 'm going to pop these into the oven for about twenty to twenty five minutes or until they developed a good karma, lisd color, and they cook down and then i 'm going to put these in wash.
my hands, and you go into making the rest of the soup at a large soup pot.
here , without two and, two and a half tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat santa that i 'm going to add in my onions.
i 'm not going to get the garlic in yet because i really want to cook the onions for a little bit about five to eight minutes.
until the developer karma lies color, and they start to breakdown.
and i, gotta, tell you, i 'm so excited for the soup.
it is one of my favorites.
it 's got obviously tomatoes and basil.
so it 's a classic combination that i love.
but it 's also perfect.
because it 's great for back to school, or if you go into work and you want to go to lunch i 'm going to top this with some parmesan croutons, and i 'll show you how to make those as well, but, you know, it 's fabulous make astute.
the night before and then put it in a thermus.
the next morning pop it in the microwave heat.
it up, put in a thermostat cover.
it tightly, the croutons say perfect at room temperature airtight bag or container.
bring it to school you 're going to have warm soup put in some croutons.
if perfect, i would serve it alongside.
some pita chips and hummus.
and you have got a lunch people will be jealous about i guarantee it.
so that 's what i 'm gonna do, is i 'm going to kind of babysit my onion and away until they get a night?
good karma lights, color, and in the mean time i 'm going to cut up some baguette for my croissant.
onions look perfect.
i 'm going to add in my garlic, and i 'm only going like the garlic, cook you gotta minute.
i just want to get rid of that raw garlic flavor stuff as that 's going.
i 'm going to finish with my croutons.
i just have a roasted garlic baguette here.
but you can use any kind of bread that you want any kind of bread you have on hand.
grab my olive oil going to drizzle it with some good quality, olive oil.
and then i 'm going to great over from the quality parmesan cheese, looks good.
i 'm not even going to toss it.
that 's why i put everything kind of all the bright, together.
so i 'm not even going to bother tossing them is going to melt over the top, the bottom of nice and crunchy delicious.
but before i pop that into the oven and check my garlic it 's looking good, smells even better.
i 'm going to give that another thirty seconds, i 'm going to pop my croutons into the oven, same temperature for twenty five.
but i 'm going to put this in a middle rack.
but it does n't burn for about ten to fifteen minutes or until, they are golden brown and crunchy and crouton like that.
i 'm going to let them and set them aside to call sewing populated.
add a my tomatoes, when you are buying, canned tomatoes, make sure that you buy the kind that 's low in sodium, or no sodium and enjoying some nice italian brand 'cause the times they got the best tomatoes.
so at this point you have a fabulous marinara sauce.
but that 's not what we want.
so i 'm going to fit it out with some chicken stock.
but you could also use vegetable stock darby totally fine looks awesome already see this sister.
now i 'm going to turn things on medium.
so that 's good, i 'm going to wait for that to come up to a boil i 'm actually going to stick in some basil.
but i 'm not shopping in.
because i 'm actually going to finish this out.
because if i were to pureed basil in the soup, it would have like the greenish red color, and i want to be pure , red.
so i 'm going to put this in to get all the flavor.
but then i 'm going to fish it out.
so this come up two boil let it simmer for about twenty minutes.
and then, in twenty minutes, the tomatoes will be roasted the croutons it will be done.
this will have a couple more minutes and then i 'm going to show you the last few steps.
so it 's been simmering for about twenty minutes, going to take out my basil if a couple pieces get us behind that 's fine.
it 's not gonna.
change up the color that much my tomatoes or gorgeous.
the other stumped up and golden brown, and that 's what you want this smells.
so delicious gonna just take him out.
put him right in i also took out my, my croutons.
they 're setting on the back burner there just kind of chilling out and cooling down, writing last the tomatoes.
it 's good, give us a nice stir.
and i 'm going to let this simmer for about five minutes, and in the mean time i 'm going to get my immersion blender ready.
plugged in if we do n't have an emergen blender, which is just handheld blender which i 'll show you in a second.
but you can do the same exact thing in a regular blender anything i make a difference is just easier.
so let this simmer for five minutes, and then clean up may immersion blender, and i 'll show you the next step.
now it looks awesome and smells even better.
because it bubble up here in the things and then nothing is worth getting hurt remember that no matter how good it is, this is emergen blender.
it 's basically a blender that i can just handheld blender.
but like i said you can use a regular blender, or food process, so, whatever and just blend this until nice and smooth that looks good.
now you could serve this.
i 'm going to add cream to this, but i 'm going to pass it through a sieve.
first , because, no i do n't kind of like the appeal of the tomatoes.
but left behind.
so i 'm going to pass it through a sieve and get a nice and smooth.
but you can absolutely serve it like this, if it does n't bother you, you know, i prefer my tomato soup really nice and smooth and creamy and decadent and delicious.
so i 'm going to just take the extra few minutes get a nice facial here with this team and pass it through that 's about all i 'm going to do once you have it all paths.
let 's put it back into the same pot oh, yeah, and it 's awesome i 'm going to season it with salt and pepper cause we had n't really season this a whole lot of, course, always start with the pepper, and you want to make sure you season, well with salt.
because going to be adding some cream in there, which is sweet tomatoes are very sweet.
they need salt, so, once that comes, up to a boil going to add in the cream.
well , i 'll show you what it looks like once we put it all together.
we 're pretty much done just going to add in a touch of cream, and you can absolutely omit the cream if you do n't want to.
but i 'm going to put it in.
i 'm just going to give it a stir continue to let it cook for a couple minutes just to make sure it 's nice and piping hot, that is, perfect now, if you are making this for lunch for tomorrow at this point i would call it, put it into the fridge, then tomorrow morning.
get up of five extra minutes like five minutes early heated up in a microwave put in a thermus cover.
you 've got yourself a good lunch.
serve it with some like pita chips.
and hummus ask gorgeous smells wonderful.
then you can put your croutons.
i 'm going to dunkin, running you can put your croutons in a little zip lock bag.
and by time you get to school or work, or whatever in lunchtime.
because the soup is in the third miss it 'll stay nice and warm, you croutons will still be crunchy.
so when, when take the soup first so go so smooth like it 's not very heavy.
which i like it 's going to vary delegate tomato flavor, but that 's my this way.
i like it.
if you like a thicker use a little bit less stock, you can always play around with ratio.
just make it once or twice and then that way, you 'll know how you like it, taste like with john.
pop up absolutely divine good WWW dot laura nick.
it 's not common to get this recipe.
i 've enjoyed spending time with me and i 'll see you next time.
