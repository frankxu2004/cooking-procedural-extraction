i gotta get moving i 'll be right there to sack i.
hi , today i 'm going to make for you, a wonderful family recipe that came from my grandmother.
and then she showed my mom how to make it chicken parmesan.
OK , let 's get started.
i 'm going to take my breadcrumb and put it in this big bowl right here.
and then i 'm going to take my milk and my eggs go and then just i 'm going to beat up the eggs a little bit in the milk OK, and then i 'm going to take my chicken breasts and what i will do is.
i 'll take my chicken breast.
and i 'm going to dredge it in the milk, and i 'm going to make sure my chick in is coated on both sides with the egg in the milk mixture.
and sometimes i 'll use my fingers and put it into the bread crumb mixture and just move it all around.
make sure i get it coded, well on both sides.
and i 'll just place it on the plate here.
and then i 'll do it again.
and now i 'm going to put the chicken into the pan and cook it up.
really nicely, on both sides till it 's nice and brown my grandmother like to make this recipe sometimes with flower, and my mom makes it with bread crumb.
sometimes i 'll do it either way, but i do like the way that the breadcrumb the nice season breadcrumb, taste.
it has different salt in it and it has pepper.
and sometimes i 'll even add a little fresh basil and parmesan cheese into the breadcrumb mixture and mix it up.
really nice because it will just add a little bit of flavor.
OK , the chicken is nice and crispy.
it smells delicious now.
what i 'm going to do is i 'll take some of moms and dads pasta sauce.
and i 'll just put it on the bottom of this pan here.
this pyrex dish, like.
so and then my individual pieces of chick in.
now i 'm only going to be making four pieces tonight.
but you can make as many as you want, and get a really big pyrex dish, and it 's a delicious recipe to have by itself with some vegetables in a nice green salad, or you might want to have it with pasta, you could even make this chick in like this, and then put it on a nice big piece of italian bread, or a nice big rustic roll.
so here we go like this, and then i will take another helping of the pasta sauce in place.
it over the top of the chick in just so, you know, i preheated my oven already to three fifty degrees.
because what i 'll do once this dish is ready.
i 'll place it in the oven, and it will cook for another thirty minutes or so.
i 'm going to be pudding this smoke provolone cheese on top like so, and i 'll tell you something.
i call this chicken parmesan.
there is parmesan cheese in the red sauce, and there 's also parmesan cheese.
i put a little bit in the season, italian bread crumbs that i bought.
but i tried this recipe with smoked provolone, one time because it 's what i had in the house, an, oh, it was delicious.
so now i always make this recipe with the smoke prevel.
own , so anyhow i take my dish.
like this put in the oven for about thirty minutes, and this is the final product.
i ca n't wait to serve it with some pasta tonight.
