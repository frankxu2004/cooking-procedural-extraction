i have my big giant tamali pot that i 'm going to use today for mike lamb, chop suet clam shop is with my daughters used to call clam chowder when they were little.
so clam shop soup, and i got all my ingredients here and then i 'll give you exact measurements on my site.
and i 'm going to start with a cast iron skillet.
i 'm heating it up with a medium, medium high flame, and i 'm going to put some bacon in there and fry it up.
and this is not a diet recipe.
sorry they making clam chowder.
an eye you can see the photo montage before this what i did cool.
somehow i fried some bacon.
if i remove the bacon after was nice and chris then i added some chopped or diced, celery and onions and then i added a stick of butter.
i set a stick of butter, and i 'm going to add a quarter cup of cornstarch.
this is going to be my stick in or for my suit and i 'm hoping.
so i 'm having the cornstarch in and stirring it into the butter mixture.
here , the good thing about cornstarch is if you need more, you just send it with water.
and you add it.
then i 'm going to add a cup of half and half to this mixture, you can use milk you can use olive oil.
instead of butter and bacon fat to stop, say everything.
and it 's just i want my suit to be really nice and hearty.
so i 'm kind of making it in a traditional way.
i do n't know their salaries traditional.
it , if it 's celerina, so we 're going to share this, and just let it come get pretty, pretty sick, i should get pretty sick ann.
i have milk to add just in case and on this side, we have a pot a large mice, molly pot of potatoes an for kansas plan mid central boiling.
so the potatoes need to get soft basically, you do n't want to should be mushy.
but you do n't want them.
you want to be pork tender, or you 're screwed otherwise.
it 'll just become potato soup, which is related which is what i 'm making for somebody who special today.
because she does n't like his daughter OK back to this.
so this is my face.
and like i said, i do have if you have a little bit of milk on standby here.
usually i make this in lower fat version, an i 'll use like i said some olive oil to saute everything and then i use cornstarch, an like a two percent milk, sometimes, i use evaporated milk pretty much whatever i have on hand.
it 's on sale words in my budget since i went to the ninety nine cent store this morning.
i found a lot of stuff.
there my bags of potatoes that i used were a dollar sixty.
nine my cans of sounds were little bit pricier.
and then i found some at another store for ninety nine cents so shop around and you 'll be able to make really good.
mills wanna bet it, OK.
so we 're going to let this that can going to turn my flame up just a little bit.
and i 'm going to actually add some sharp cheddar to that.
and i 'll show you how to make a cheddar cream.
cheddar cheese sauce that i use for my homemade mac and cheese.
and it 's going to go into this suit during it, letting it get nice and thick.
maybe we need to let it.
i want to make it my daughter makes a space like woo funny.
we would film ourselves, but here just we look wonderful today and with the potatoes that are boiling with a clamp.
i threw the juice in unless you have a brand of clams, which i had one time that we 're really sandy.
you can throw the jew soon, and i 'm going to throw in some sea salt about that 's probably about it.
two teaspoons potatoes will absorb a lot of involved help.
lee not alone coming back to this, and here it is getting really super thick.
now you can kind of see it should be nice and sticks like that coding as soon i 'm going to go ahead and send this down with a little tiny bit of milk, if i need too, i can always mash up some of the potatoes create a better consistency for my clam chowder.
but this is going to go into this big pot, and it wo n't go in until the potatoes are nice and soft , though.
and this is what 's going to make your clam chop.
nice and creamy and before i put this in to the pot i will put bacon crumbled bacon in there.
so enjoy gesture seasonings absent salt little bit salt, maybe some white pepper.
and you 're good to go.
