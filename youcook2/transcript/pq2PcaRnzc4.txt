so we can fry them as is to cover our burger in as everyone likes a bacon cheeseburger right, and then get the chop and smaller the bits the better this bacon is going to go into AR rahman mixture for you see how easy it is to cut this bacon it 's.
so beautiful what 's this it 's an epic meal time, knife bacon shops as you can see this beautiful mosaic of bacon deliciousness quit the bacon on the pan without the time being on and then there are on high heat big sauce pan or pot halfway with water this further ramen noodles, do yourself a favor and cover the pot water, will boil faster, if it 's covered logic right now, i 'm going to make catch up mixture grab all of your ingredients for the ketchup, which i 've neatly measured out prior to starting to film round fairy dust tears of children whatever i had i think my fingernails last night salt, and pepper some water, this.
next ingredient is going to set your catch up aside from everyone else is catch up smoke throw it on the stove until it starts to bubble and then turn off the heat bubbles off take that off the heat now, i 'm going to get all making these brown beef burger patties i got my ground beef over here i have about a cup of minced onion add that in you never want to have your meat unseasoned.
so out of sync salt and pepper see your discretion minus the castle we 're going to add one egg, add your bread crumbs last whenever least my bottom bitch diana at about a third of a cup make sense together.
so i would say this big whatever that big is big lastic put them on your cutting board we 're going to make as many pieces, we can then we 're going to put them in the fridge to settle up our water is boiling.
you want to leave these in there for about three minutes going to get nice and solve them, we 're going to drain the water from the noodles were going to scramble two eggs at this beef flavor to our egg mixture and then combine it with the remnants of the round and possesses, a beet flavor baking goes in the ram and do n't worry about the extra grease it will just add flavor, add your egg mixture fast here 'cause the residual heat might cook the egg and you do n't want scrambled eggs in your ramen burgers at all spread this mixture over a baking tray trying to make an even layer of ram and bacon egg mixture over here just press down.

let them work.
burgers are done so the rahman is tightened up.
