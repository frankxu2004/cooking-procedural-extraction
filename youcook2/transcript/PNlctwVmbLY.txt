is the squishy monster?
today , i hope i convinced you guys and not just throw everything out into compost.
and if you can compost it try to eat it such as this watermelon rise.
there is an abundance of it right now and it 's my favorite fruits.
so , instead of throwing away the rhyme i use the outer green part compost that in the inner part to make a really light crunchy and refreshing an easier version of him she watermelon is my favorite fruits.
so the fruit part, the meat part of it is my favorite part.
but the part we 're looking for here is that inner white rhymes.
so this is like a perfect recession, food nothing gets thrown away, so using an ice cream scoop.
i want to scoop out all the meat and put it in a bowl.
and i love bread blending chunks of frozen watermelon with some agave, A in some line and doing kind of like a watermelon slush in the summertime.
it 's so delicious, so this will definitely be eaten that we 're looking for that white ryan parts.
i 'm going to scoop all of this out, second step is to shave off all the outer green fits.
so you want to make sure you scrub your watermelon pretty well.
because a lot of people have handled.
it suggests for sanitary reasons.
but this is what the inside look like i have scraped it all of its juicy, juicy, juicy bits and you want to take a sharp knife and you want to start shaving away at it.
so i would like to take the top part off like this and do n't forget the compost this stuff every bit of this stuff all parts of this watermelon can be used so, just a great way to reduce waste arrow and then just shave down kind of like you would when you segments in orange, just like that, and then just keep working down making little strips until your entire watermelon is left with just the white.
now i just want to cut little strips in sue them.
so cut it down and have and.
let 's cut this in half as well and just that and maybe make little cuts like this little strips, like that i 've tumbled all my little shards into a bowl and i want to sprinkle over with some coarse sea salt kosher or table or find salt will not work here.
so you wanna, make sure you get your hands on some coarse sea salt and use your hands and kind of massage it and the purpose for this is for it to draw out all that excess moisture can talk today i 'm full load up my words.
because it 's a very juicy fruit it 's going to still be a pretty juicy, finished product when you bite into it 'll be crisp and refreshing.
but it 'll draw out and extract all that extra moisture.
so you want to kind of sit in this fault for about an hour.
so well, my ride is hanging out, gives me ample time to make my paste.
so instead of a bowl i want to add in my filing minced garlic i finally minced ginger and then what you can do which is the pepper flakes the cream pepper, flakes, not the powder suspect that in as well, and then i have some green onions and you can use sugar gabare, honey, i 'm using honey.
because i have an abundance of honey sales.
so i 'm going to drop that in there an optionally, you can also use some interviews or some brian tripped and i 'm going to make this together and set it aside until my ryan is ready to be mixed with it i have drained and rinsed my rhymes.
so it 's just a matter of meshing the paste into my little slivers so, i 'm going to tumble in all of that paste into my big bowl with the bryans, and i just drained and rinsed it if you like that braininess in that faulty bite, does n't bother you i just took a bite of it if it does n't bother you just kind of let it fit and it will act is.
kind of like a thought.
to kind of combine everything.
together , but hydrating, rinsed it.
because it is a little bit salty for me, you can always, with salt back in later.
but you ca n't take it back out.
so you want to toss this mixture for about three to four minutes until everything is nicely combined in the pace has kind of melted the heat from your hand is melted that paste into the watermelon rind my favorite way to eat with kim, she would have to be with some steamed rice.
and some grilled mackerel some type of protein a little bit of like, sticky rice and maybe a super do to you.
but i 'm going to go in here, and just tried this.
because i did n't sleep a fight, while i was mixing it.
so it will be a complete surprise to see how it turned out, you know, it is got such invite nice salty bite, and it 's got the flavor and all the essence of coochie.
but as you thought huge together in a flash in the utilized something that may have been returned away or put in the compass a delicious crunchy and refreshing i hoped i 'd give this a child to thank you guys for hanging out with this.
sushi , monster, and i 'll see you guys very soon.
