for years, i have tried many different non, versions and today i 'm going to share with you.
my favorite, so, let 's get started.
now three cups of flour will go ahead and add half a teaspoon of baking powder.
one tablespoon of sugar and one teaspoon of salt.
so in our all purpose flour, we have added half a teaspoon baking powder one tablespoon sugar, and one teaspoon salt and will mix it well, and will also go ahead and add one egg.
so i had beaten one egg.
so i 'll go ahead and add this in an for this non recipe.
i 'm using quick rise instant yeast and what i 'm going to do is i 'm just going to take one teaspoon.
can add it in about one fourth of a cup of water, so that this dormant least becomes active?
so just taking one teaspoon of yeast and will mix it in our one cup of water, and we let this stand for about ten minutes.
and then we 'll go ahead and add it without flour alright.
so , while our yeast standing will go ahead and drop everything else.
so sold sugar, baking powder egg or in them bull her half a cup of milk and two tablespoons of oil.
so we 'll mix these well, or yeast will become a little frothy appan , standing.
so we 'll go ahead and add this in and make a smooth dough softs, moto, and you can add water as required.
so look at that.
are yeast has become a little ferhati, and that 's what we want?
we 'll go ahead and add this in look at that.
are nice and smooth dough and the more you needed this software, your nans will be?
so the door has to be release often.
that 's why we 're needing it.
once they do, is ready?
will go head?
cover it up with a damp cloth and keep it at a warm place for about four hours, and in between, you can go ahead and eat it a little bit again to keep it soft.
and then will start preparing our naan bread, you can see our dough is ready.
will go ahead?
cover it up with a damp cloth set it aside, and after four hours, you will notice that the dough has doubled in size.
the volume has increased and then will start preparing on red look at that our dough is ready.
so now i 'll show you how you can make naan bread without an oven on a ban on a skillet right on stove top.
easy to make and good flavor, there be around dobles will go ahead and flatter their mouth and simply flatten them out on the shelf.
if you need you can add a little bit of over and rye flour.
the rolling pin.
and flatten them out, please spreading out our door to make a nice thin bread like this.
and will go ahead and put it on our band, the band right here.
sure it 's really hot.
so will, he did.
and once it 's hard to see the smoke coming out, then you can go ahead and place your read on to it basically very similar process, like making a chapati.
but if you have hard time making chapathi if they turn out hard drive this with the non doe, and it will turn out.
so soft and you can always make a bunch and keep it and eat it couple of nights later do n't really need to put any oil.
but if you want you can so just a little bit, and you will see the door rising small bubbles and that 's fine does turn it around.
push it down a little bit.
this is like a really, really soft almost reminds me of like a culture, but it still taste, like now, see it has started to get brown.
and it has started to rise.
that 's what we need, we need it to rise and when you press if that helps in making the door eyes look at that both sides are nice and brown.
so you 're none without oven, without grill is ready on a stovetop, so enjoy hey do n't forget to subscribe to eat.
