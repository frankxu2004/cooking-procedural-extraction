hey guys, i know it 's been awhile since my last video, but i had some issues with my camcorder, so i 'm back.
and i 'm just got a very simple dish night doing some pork fried rice and brown rice.
it 's so versatile is basically, you know, your leftovers casserole.
so we 'll start with just some rice.
if you got leftover rice that 's great, is best to make this the day before?
so it can dry out in the fridge.
then i just like to do some garlic and ginger with some oil in the wok just as a base for the flavor.
so today i 'm using some chopped up pork chops.
but the nice thing about fried rice is you can make it with basically anything.
if you got leftover, chicken or steak, even vegetarian is quite easy to do, but tonight we 're going to work.
so i 'm just going to fry up some pork chops here.
nothing , too fancy just, just some salt and pepper.
and i like to throw this in with the ginger and garlic.
now the trick with, with stir frank, something like this is you want to have all ingredients ready to go.
you need to do it some of the steps need to be done pretty quickly.
so make sure everything is chopped into small pieces.
so here the pork is done cooking.
i 'm just gonna slide it away from the center of the block towards the edge to give us room to add some veggies.
so you can use pretty much.
anything like today.
i 've got some, some shredded cabbage here.
you just have green onions.
so nice simple thing to do.
but , i mean, if you 've got leftover say cook corn is fine.
any chinese greens, or if i meet up keys, i mean, you do n't have to even have vegetables.
is really a great versatile dish?
so after about that fry up a little bit, everyone has their own recipe for fried rice here, is one of the ways i like to do it add a little bit of spice with some dubon john?
so this gives a little bit of saltiness.
but also some spice ansa mommy flavor.
'cause it 's permitted bean paste, so there 's plenty of, plenty of savory flavor.
their fortunate the camera right in this team, so you ca n't see too well here, but just like to fry it up with the cooked ingredients here.
so once that 's well mexicans fried for a minute or so, again.
we 're going to slide the ingredients away from the center.
so we have room to add some other stuff so he 's going to add some sesame oil.
and this gives a great flavor mean if you do n't have it, you can use canola oil or whatever.
but sesame E is great.
it will add or rice.
you see it hold its shape really well.
fries a lot better if it does n't have excess water.
so this is why leftover rice is better.
because it had a chance in the fridge to dry off.
so i just want to mix that around and try to fry it a little bit here.
yeah , if you fry it at really high temperature for a long time, you can actually make it quite crispy.
i 'm not a big fan of that.
i like it is still being pretty much like normal cook rice.
so , so, one thing to note when you 're doing this is especially if you have an electric stove.
you want to crank the heat up pretty much as high as it goes.
you should basically be hearing this sizzling sound the whole way through you.
do n't want to really be steaming ingredients?
you want to fly them.
so the thing with the walk is it then do n't have a lot of heat capacity.
so we 're relying on basically the power of the burner, and if you 've got a crappy electric range, there 's not a lot of power there.
so i just like to add a few flavor ingredients here, just a splash of mirren add a little sweetness to it.
first traditional soy sauce again.
like i always do i like to marry.
and you just do this to taste, and just a tiny splash of some chinese black vinegar.
i find as a distinctive taste.
it kind of balances out the other flavors.
and we 'll just makes it a really, well, here.
if this is all you have this is, you 're pretty much done here, but i like to add some eggs.
so what would make a little, well, in the center here, and if your rice is soaked up all the oil just add scored a little bit more oil in.
and you can pre you can pre mix the eggs if you like.
i just like to crack, and right in the middle here, so, i mean, there 's a lot of different ways to do this.
if , if you let it sit in the middle here for awhile, you can get large kind of nice big pieces of egg, i know some people like that do n't have huge fan of that.
so you can see it here.
i just got kind of small chunks.
oeg kind of blended together before was completely cooked in the middle, and i 'm just going to mix that in, with the rest of the rice and that 's pretty much it.
so , i mean, give it a shot, if you, i mean, tune it to your flair, i mean, there 's plenty of different flavors here, even within china, you know, there 's probably twenty or thirty different major variations of this ann, yeah.
so every chef does it their own way.
so i like to finish it off with ground up szechuan pepper, so, i mean, it 's not a really spicy here.
but i 'd like to give it a little bit that 's each one flair and that 's pretty much it, it 's a, it 's a very unassuming dish, is a great way to get rid of leftovers?
thanks for watching hope.
