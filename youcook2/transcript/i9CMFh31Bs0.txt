this is sara hopkins.
you might have seen some of my previous videos and today.
what i want to do is share one of my favorite recipes an in my opinion, one of the most healthiest and beneficial recipes around.
so you may have heard about fermented foods, they seem to be a bit of a trending topic at the moment.
because most of us have a pretty poorly, sort of run digestive system due to excessive alcohol consumption coffee consumption and antibiotics especially food.
so is really re populate the guts.
so really allow they got to heal and allow the right population of healthy gut flora to re populate that got again and to get things working sauerkraut is a really simple recipe to make, so, i thought that, that would be a great one to start with.
because it 's really easy everybody can do it, it 's also super cost effective.
you can buy a sauerkraut, but it 's quite expensive.
all it takes is a cabbage and some salt.
so i 'll take you through the process today and hopefully you can incorporate this into your diet on a daily basis.
so the first thing that we need is a cabbage.
always has to be organic, organic.
is really important foods that are not organic when they firment there basically sort of increasing that toxicity of whatever the pesticides are that are present on the food?
so organic, is really important which is obviously going to cost a little bit more?
but it 's worthwhile investment for your health.
so a cabbage a good quality fermenting jar is important, and the one that i 've got here is called a fowlers, vakola, are you can use like the clip lock jars?
but i would recommend looking into a fowlers for cola.
good quality, sasol, so again it 's really important to get a good quality naturally sourced.
we do n't want any refined salts.
they 're not going to allow the fermentation process to occur adequately.
and then you just want some seasoning.
so this is me.
i 'm going to use today is caraway seeds juniper berries and some deal tips.
an will have a look.
so what we 're going to do is, we 're going to start with chopping the cabbage.
finally , and by the way, be careful with the knife.
otherwise , you cut yourself like i did.
so i find the best way to chop the cabbage shown to me by a good friend very recently is into quarters and then it 's easy to get that core out there.
we go so then we 're going to chop the cabbage you can use a mandoline to do this.
it does make it easier.
so you want to, you want to chop it relatively finally watching out for those fingers.
so hopefully you can see from this, roughly.
finally , you wanted to chop.
so , we put the whole cabbage finally chopped into a nice big bowl.
all needs to be a fairly good size.
and then we want to add the soul.
so the salt is going to help release the brine, which is going to allow the lacto fermentation process, which is providing all that beautiful bacteria that is going to heal.
i got so the rule of thumb with salt is that you want about two point five to three percent of the weight of the cabbage.
so in this case, we 've got about twenty grams of wade that out.
i 'm gonna add that in then, i 'm going to add my spices or seasonings in.
so probably for this cabbage, which was about eight hundred ish grams i 'm going to use about a teaspoon and then i 'm using probably about a teaspoon of juniper berries as well, you build hips.
still , can be quite strong?
so maybe half a teaspoon.
i do have some fresh deal in the garden if you do you have fresh deal.
i would recommend using that now for the fun.
pot , what you want to do is we really need to release all of the juices from this cabbage.
because they 're really making, you know, the core sort of constituents of this whole fermentation process.
so it 's called a brian.
so now we 're going to get in really.
mix that salt into the cabbage, which is going to take about ten minutes.
the really work it, it 's a good workout.
really want to squeeze that cabbage.
i like to call it mastication.
because it 's likely using your hands to chew the cabbage with mastication is chewing.
so you really masticating that cabbage to really release all that, see all that beautiful , brian.
so that 's all of that.
that 's the sort of sugar and starch containing the vegetable that will allow the fermentation process to occur by now.
it 's sort of.
it takes probably about ten minutes for it to really get to this level of brininess, and you can see that it 's release.
often bryony and all those curves blended in and most important thing that you put in there is love.
so make sure that you know, give it lots of love, and really massage, massage, all of your goodness into it and.
now we 're going to place it into our fermenting jar, which, uh, i am a little bit uncoordinated at that 's OK.
so this is also sort of part of the important and important part of the process.
so we need to make sure that we 're packing that cabbage in really, really tired.
because the cabbage needs to be entirely covered by brian for the fermentation process to occur in the best possible environment, really, really punching it down and we 've got lots of brian in the bottom here.
so it 's going to be really well covered an obviously it 's important to wash your hands before you do this that seems like a pretty obvious thing to do.
but just to make sure that you 're getting the right bacteria in there, and not anything else that you might have been touching and if you are squeamish about that you can use some rubber gloves obviously got a rubber finger for where i 've cut, myself.
but you can use well, fitting rubber gloves.
but i think there 's something to be said for really getting in contact with, and having some personal connection back to our food, which again is really sort of playing into that whole palaeo piece, you know, it 's about getting back to natural roots and our ancestors always fermented food and they always use their fingers and hands to eat, and touched and prepare their food and.
so i, i personally think that using your hands is the best way to prepare a really good healthy robust sauerkraut OK sorry.
but lots of beautiful, brian, and we 're going to push that down.
so that it covers i 'm going to really jam it in.
so that it 's nice and tired and actually that 's probably the right hot you want to leave a little bit of room.
because when it starts to ferment, it can actually start to bubble as you can see here there is a little bit of bubbling going on.
so you want to make sure that you do have about that width between sort of the top of the brian and then the lid.
so now we 're going to place the lead on.
so this particular fermenting jar and all good fermenting jazz should be creating an anaerobic environment.
so no oxygen that 's, that 's the idea.
so with this particular jar, make sure that the rubber band is fitted correctly around the outside then hot that date on it, and i like to line it up with the line that 's on the top of the lead, and they have a beautiful, amazingly healthy jar of sauerkraut, which is amazing for healthy gut flora, and also tastes absolutely delicious.
so i 'm going to leave that.
now in a dark place.
so probably in my pantry for up to four weeks in this particular jar.
so i 'll probably leave this for somewhere between two to four weeks to really allow the optimal fermentation process to occur and after that, it can be popped into the fridge or popped into another jar and enjoyed as a condiment once a day or twice a day if you feel like it to really help reconstitute the gut flora an improve your health for this recipe and many more head to my blog, which is health, well being dot com dot AU to seeing you again soon.
