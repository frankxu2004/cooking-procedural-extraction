how to make spicy buffalo chicken wings.
hello , welcome to videojug my name is CJ, and today, i 'll be making some spicy chicken wings, so, let 's get started.
you will need the following ingredients to serve two people, there will be a complete recap at the end, step one marvelous marinade.
first , i 'm gonna make a marinade for my chicken wings.
essentially , the marinade is going to buttermilk and some spices and in the buttermilk kind of breakdown, a chicken and make it really tender when it comes to fry attack.
the first thing i do is i take the buttermilk.
anna poured in the bowl, well, here.
i have some chili powder going toward that end.
it is a lot of cayenne.
but going to be spicy, i put the key in the marinade also.
because you 're going to have hot sauce at the end will be different sort of dimensions of the hot side.
this will be kind of a cooked eaten another how the heat of obtaining buffalo sauce just a little stir.
here it should become pink in a second yes.
i was right all right now and bring over the chicken wings, and i like to salt the chicken wings right now.
instead of like putting a whole bunch of salt marinade.
because then i know how much i 'm kind of like salting they 'll get some salting after they come out of the fryer, too.
but movies, bad boys around get him some seasoning and then i 'm going to do is pour the marinade right on top there we go this marinade also important.
because it will form like an at he sieve for the flower to stick to it later.
so kind of massage, this around in here, the chicken wings , OK.
these are all done.
and i 'm gonna take him to the fridge step, two flower power alright.
so i got my chick in here, uh, out of the refrigerator, it 's been marinating for a few hours in the buttermilk.
so hopefully that will make it nice and tender.
we 're going to do here now is just drudging some flower.
and then said over here.
we 're going to try it and go from there can pull put a whole bunch in here sometime bigger deal.
our hands going to get dirty.
regardless , we get very dirty in a second here.
the buttermilk mixture there actually adds, as kind of like an agent to keep some of this, a flower on here actually need to kind of attacking somebody level clumps of it here and there.
that will crisp up nicely and out of the overall wing experience step three deep fry.
now this is already here to go into the oil, the oil is about three hundred degrees.
i 'm using canola oil, so, i guess the most healthy you could use beef fat or other things that a lot more flavor.
but in the pursuit of trying to be somewhat healthy here with these chicken wings were going for this.
so here we go, check and see how their doing still a little tan.
let 's get him back in there the more love you get nice and golden brown as you can see does n't take very long there 's not a lot of not a lot of meat on these bad boys to ramat, done at boom lay it out on your digitali are mornings, bad boys damn, damn should n't be more than six at a time other thing is like when you do add things to oil that are cold it 's going into the oil down, it 's going to take a second to get back in the speed step for sauce and serve i 've got all my wings.
now fried up, and going to put him in this bowl here and i 'm going to add some buffalo mouse i 'm using red hot right.
now i think it 's the best we go do some of this on here, a little coffee costs OK, and i had to serve it up all ready to go.
maybe some, uh, you know, celery sticks in there and there it is chicken wings.
