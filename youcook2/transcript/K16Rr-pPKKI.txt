hi guys, i 'm more of italian today per my husband.
my recipe for his favorite mashed potatoes in the world.
these are my redskin mashed potatoes full of chives, buttery, cheesy goodness.
they are perfect for this time of year are real hearty side dish and really the most incredible mashed potato.
you can serve at your holiday table there full of flavor.
and i just absolutely love them.
we 're going to start.
i 'm going to share it with you right now.
show you the potatoes.
these are some call.
it a little baby redskin potatoes.
you can use the bigger ones if you want or you have to cut them smaller.
but the point is you want these little red skin potatoes skins, really nice and thin.
so , therefore, when you mash them together, you can leave the skin in there now.
if you do n't want to leave the skin, and by all means peeling potatoes it 's completely fine.
either way they 're going to delicious now.
but what i want to do is scrub them really, really, well, because you 're going to eat the skin.
so you want to make sure that, that 's taken care of and you want to have a big pan with water.
now the pot is not turned on yet i did n't turn the water on yet.
because one of the biggest mistakes people make is when they cook potatoes to make mashed potatoes or to make any kind of potato dishes they took.
take the potatoes, and they put him in boiling water.
what that 's doing is cooking the outside and the inside not cooked yet.
so it 's just that it really uneven cooking temperature.
so it 's not going to be the best result.
so you start with cold water and then when you add everything together, you turn it on.
and you cook them.
so i 'm going to do is to my potatoes, and i 'm just going to quarter them.
because again these are just going to cook in no time.
now to the potatoes or just a little bit bigger.
i 'm going to cut them a little smaller, going to cut them a little bit more.
because of what you want to make sure is that all of your potatoes are about the same size.
so they cook evenly.
there 's nothing worse than when you have one potato that 's perfectly cooked another piece.
it 's raw, so you want to see time and again.
i 'm cutting the bigger ones into about six pieces and then the small one like this one is really small.
so you want to make sure that you keep that in mind anytime.
you cooking potatoes or any vegetable.
really you want to cook evenly the last of the potatoes now before you turn the water on.
you want to make sure that you sought you 're cooking water.
because like you do with pasta this is the only chance you 're going to get.
so cooked, actually season the potatoes themselves before you go ahead and sees in your final dish.
it 's super, super important like if you 've ever boiled potatoes with no salt in the water it is bland.
they do n't have very much flavor to them.
same thing with pasta if you could, if you boil pass, that plain water with no salt, think really taste like nothing so it makes a huge difference.
all i 'm going to do is bring this to a boil kind of, take the heat down to about similar so just watch cook for about twenty minutes.
or until they are fork tender, which is really important.
you do n't want this to be at all and then tell.
you want these to be really, really soft and tender to get that perfect, mashed potato consistency.
and when they are n't there, we will move on to the next step.
my potatoes cooked in boiling water for about twenty five minutes will make.
sure , it really, really soft, and then all i did i drain them.
and i put them back into the same pops, that is a trick and i have the heat on low.
and i 'm just going to use my potato masher to match this up.
and over here what i have, is some unsalted butter and some cream cheese that are a room temperature along with some chopped chives?
some whole milk that i just warmed up in the microwave and some good quality problem in general, and of course going to see that this was something pepper to taste all i 'm doing is.
i 'm just mashing this up to measure, and i 'm going to take my knife and little by little i 'm going to add some butter and cream cheese, and just mix them together as i masham what the heat on low until you have the cream cheese in the butter all combined my cream cheese.
and my butter or mixed in there really well, so i 'm not going to do a still have, that.
he do n't low i 'm going to creating a good amount of parmigiano, you know, me, you know, i like it.
so i 'm going to probably put in about good three quarters of a cup or so, but, you know, you can add as much as little as you want.
if you do n't want to add any bio.
means leave it out.
but , i mean, i do n't know why you want to go ahead and greeting a really good amount looks good.
and i 'm going to add in my chop chives that give it a really good sort of fresh in onion bite.
but just a little something that limones this up a little bit.
because it is really, really rich plenty of black pepper and salt 's make sure that uses in this, well.
because potatoes love, love salt, and even though we did boil them in the salted, while you want to show you season as well and then just add a little bit of milk at a time and just stop until you reach your desired consistency of your mashed potatoes.
and , that is it.
this is looking perfect for me.
i use about three quarters of a cup of whole milk is creamy.
i can smell the cheese is going to be divided.
i 'm just going to give myself a little taste because i do have people coming over for dinner.
but i hardly could resist mashed potatoes ever very hot.
but i think if you do give them a try, you 'll understand why there 's sweet, yet their buttery and their cheesy and they 've got that sort of bright onion from the chives.
now , like at their chunky from the skin that we left on there to get the recipe.
of course roller in the kitchen dot com, i hope you enjoy spending time with me and it 's always, i will see you in the.
next one bye, bye.
and when they are n't there, we will move on to the next step, yeah, mashed potato tank much, but did not tell him.
and i got turkey and the other man we got an early thanksgiving dinner and we 're so excited.
and i got cranberry sauce in the french.
