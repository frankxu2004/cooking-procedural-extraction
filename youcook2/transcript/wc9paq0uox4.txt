hey , everybody doctor bedroom showed i found her well, dot org in the editor of be more magazine here with a fermentation IST summer.
bach dear friend and going to show us some wonderful things to do with food add some life to it and make it super food.
so we 're going to make some sauerkraut today really simple and the exciting thing about this is that all you need here is cabbage onion.
dill caraway and salt.
now you 're going to core the cabbage.
always just take out the center there.
they were going to try to shred this, and keep it a fairy, fairly even texture alright will chop up some onion OK, the reason i use onion is.
because it has prebiotics and it has annual.
and so it 's going to help this to ferment faster, but it also a lot of times it guarantees that this is going to work alright.
so now i 'm going to chop up some dill, dill.
just makes it taste delicious so it 's going to add a lot of flavor to your sauerkraut alright, so we have the vegetables chopped up in here.
and we 're going to add some spices you can use any spices.
or you scare away because it is a really traditional sauerkraut spice.
and then we 're going to add salt, salt is important, sure that you are using a non iodized sea salt iodine as a disinfectant.
we do n't want to use that in here.
so i have celtic sea salt here.
but you can use like the himalayan pink sea.
salt you can use any of these, and we 're going to add for this.
we 're probably just going to add about a tablespoon or.
so generally the rule is three to four tablespoons per gallon of sauerkraut.
so that 's a gallon with it all packed in there were doing about the court today.
so we 're going to fill it up into here.
this is about a quart use.
i 'm saying like one tablespoon one and a half tablespoons.
you wanted to taste as salty as a lays potato chip.
and so you just want to mix it, and you 're really just keep trying to get the salt touch, all the veggies here.
so that 's going to take the water out of the vegetables, an into this solution and i 'll show you how this creates the brine i do n't add, water when i make sauerkraut.
so it 's going to be a little bit more potent than your normal sauerkraut that said watered down essentially going to be sour and delicious.
so that 's all the water you need because you 're pulling it out of the cabbage.
do you want to use fresh organic produce because it 's filled with all this water?
and that 's what we 're trying to use to create the brian alright, so, let 's see here.
i do n't know if you can see it 's listening right like this old is already starting to get this when you 're trying to make good sauerkraut you want to make it taste good here right.
now pounding it in there you 're getting, it kind of jammed in there as much as you can well i want to get all the air bubbles out i see.
so i really want to push this down here i want to smash all of the cabbage in hearest, hightly as possible.
so that the air bubbles are gone we 're starting to see some of the water gurgle through here see that, yeah.
so that 's going to form our bride.
so essentially let me just kind of show you the stages.
now so, what you 're going to do is you 're going to fill this up at least an inch in the top, maybe an inch and a half two inches and that 's going to just really keep it from overflowing 'cause for the first week is going to be incredibly active so, what 's really interesting , is.
add a starter if you notice.
but just the vegetables in the salt and the bacteria that are living on this cabbage right.
now in a bacteria probably on my hands, you know, that smashes down in.
here are the bacteria that are going to inoculate and start growing.
now that we 've created an aerobic environment.
so the way that i do it i like these jars, easy, you do n't really want to clamp it all the way down you just leave it like this , right.
so the error can like basically like flow out the carbon dioxide can flow out as it ferments.
but you do n't have a lot of the stuff from your kitchen in her house flying in.
so that 's how we want to leave it.
this is one that has been going for a few days.
so , i want you to just notice the difference in these two.
this was this, a few days ago and so one thing is that it 's really, really juicy.
i mean, there 's that anaerobic environment cool for the first week, and if you look see how it 's like starting to get more translucent, like just notice that a lot of the white parts of the cabbage have changed.
it 's starting to, starting to break down a little bit and that 's what the bacteria do.
just in a few days, yeah, just in a few days, i usually let this go for probably two to four weeks open like this, like this, and then this starts to happen.
and you let it die.
let it ring it only two to four weeks.
yeah , because when i take it out, i taste it to make sure it 's good and then i put it in the refrigerator and at that point, i will clamp this down.
so this one has been going for about one week and again.
you can tell like this cabbage.
it 's more translucent look.
it 's changed from the green.
it 's getting a little bit more yellow.
and this one sour it 's delicious, many people are going to want to eat it now, and that 's fine.
you just clamp down put in your fridge it 's good to go.
so look you could eat this.
you need anything down mine right point along the spectrum, that 's all edible, but you want it to get to that magic moment.
this one thing going for three weeks.
so this one is delicious.
again totally different color translucent.
you can almost like see.
there 's no more white modeling like there is another one, an, yeah, go for it right and so, what 's changed.
is this has gotten more sour and that sour flavor is the lactic acid?
so as you ferment you basically are letting these bacteria create and carbon dioxide.
so the food it blocks out the food borne pathogens, but then the good healthy bugs that made this party happen are still there, and then we eat it.
they come into us, right.
so you 're getting the benefit of both your getting this, this action where it prevents food borne pathogens from growing right.
so inside your body is actually going to help get rid of any bad organisms that you do n't want living there and bring in the healthy bacteria do.
i sure in the good guys right on.
so you guys you saw the recipe here, will add it to wherever you 're seeing this.
so you can follow through with this people finding summer box dot com is the best place to find me.
i also have a free gift on there for the top food that i recommend, obviously might be sauerkraut.
but you should check that out if you want to learn how to shop for the right kind of raw unpasteurized, sauerkraut awesome guys, fermentation IST summer.
bach , i think that, that 's the coolest title in the world.
i love your car.
