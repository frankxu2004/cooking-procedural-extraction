i 've done that the sucking process is completed and as you see all the greens and the doll has plumptre and doubled in the volume and it would be great while blending it will be easy and for grinding, you can use the grinder or the mixer or the normal blender.
so let 's get started with a blending process have drained all the water from the rice that had been soaking overnight and this water is helpful in aiding the fermentation process, while blending the dolls and the rise.
i 'm gonna use the same water in which the down and their eyes have been soaking.
i 'm just gonna add little bit of the mixture about one fourth cup approximately into the london or the hunger use the grinder over here and into this.
i 'm going to add a little bit of water.
i 'm going to start up using the little amount of the rise and the doll mixture and a little amount of water.
otherwise it will be not blended properly.

i 'm done making the batter and i ended up using about one cup of water by blending this and the texture of battery should look like this.
it 's a little bit encore side, not very smooth.
so now this goes into the warm oven.
so that it gets formatted, well, i 'm going to just cover this and have already warmed up the oven to about one.
eighty fahrenheit, or approximately two hundred fahrenheit should be fine with the batter.
and i 've turned it off after it reached that certain temperature have turned it off.
and now i 'm going to move this onto the form of an.
you can just leave it in a warm place.
but here in a here in the place where we 're living now, it 's very cold right now.
so i 'm gonna move this on to the warm oven, which i have heated up and turned it off to about one.
eighty fahrenheit, or about two hundred fahrenheit should be fine, too.
and after every four hours, or five powers, i 'm gonna take off the battery from the oven and again warm.
the oven to about two hundred fahrenheit.
and turn it off and just pop it into the oven and i 'll be carrying on for every.
well , so now will be back after about approximately ten to twelve hours of fermentation, so that those are batter will be fermented well.
