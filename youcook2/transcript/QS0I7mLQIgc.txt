hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with tomato, bisque that 's right.
we 're doing tomato soup sricharan, slightly more promiscuous cousin.
the tomato bisque.
we 're going to use canned tomatoes, but do n't worry.
i will be explained so the first app here is going to be fairly standard soup, making procedure.
we 're going to put our soup pot over medium heat with a little bit of olive oil in it and we 're going to sweat some onions and celery, you were going to add a big pinch of salt that 's going to help bring out a little bit of that liquid.
we 're going to give that esther and we 're simply going to cook that for about.
i do n't know six or seven minutes five or six minutes.
i never time it.
i just cooked over medium heat until the onions kind of soften.
and turned translucent and looks something like that C.
and there 's the magic of video that would take me like a paragraph to describe the look.
but we do n't have to you can just look at it though that 's what he means.
so at that point we 're going to add our garlic and give that esther and we 're going to cook that for just like a minute.
the only real way to screw up this step, would be to brown the garlic?
you tell you, do not brown the garlic?
i just saute it for like a minute, and then we 're going to introduce our liquid.
i 'm going to use chicken broth that 's my personal choice.
of course, a vegetable stock will work beautifully here especially one made with mushrooms, mushrooms and tomatoes.
and if times are tough you could just use water.
that 's fine, well, not really fine.
but it 'll work.
so we 're going to pour that in we 're going to give it a stir.
and then it 's time for the star of the show, the tomatoes, and i 'm going to use one large can of crushed san marzano tomatoes.
oh , we 've talked about those before.
and on the block post, i will explain in detail not using fresh tomatoes for this and spoiler alert.
it 's the exact same reasons.
we usually do n't use fresh tomatoes for tomato sauces and by the way, if you ca n't find crushed san marzano the can of whole samaras anna, will work just got a crush of yourself, and that would be fine.
because we 're going to blend all this.
anyway , so we 're going to start tomatoes were going to raise the heat.
we want to bring this up to a simmer going.
turn my flame up to high.
and while we 're waiting for it to bubble let 's go ahead and season this up a little bit.
i 'm going to some freshly ground, black pepper, a little touch of cayenne and a little bit of pep rica, but i have used the smoke.
pepper rica, before in this, and it is lovely and at this point, i probably had a little more salt also.
but my chicken broth was perfectly seasoned, so i 'll taste and adjust for that later and besides assault i warn you right now.
we 're also going to add some sugar to this very critical ingredients.
but i 'm going to wait on that, too.
so we 're going to do is simply wait for this to come up to a simmer at which point we 're going to turn the ingredient.
they really makes this a bisque.
and that would be the rice.
so we 're going to learn about three tablespoons of regular white long grain rice.
actually , used a variety of rice called jasmine will work.
i just like saying jasmine, jasmine so were stirring the rice.
and that 's what 's going to thicken up this soup.
but it 's going to be silky, not starchy, which is kind of funny 'cause we 're adding starch.
but it 's not going to be that kind of start, finish you get if you had a whole bunch of flour based rule or cornstarch and that 's another thing i 'll talk about more in the blog post, and then the game plan here is, i want you to adjust the heat down to low medium.
low whichever provides you with a nice steady simmer.
and while that 's emery, and if you want to skim any foam off or any of the fat that rises to the top feel free this is not my discus, your bisque a little bit of recreational skimming and we 're going to do is, let that simmer for about thirty five to forty five minutes or until the rice and vegetables are absolutely isoft as they can be and the mixture should look something similar to this at this point we 're going to turn it all the way, down to low, and we 're going to give it a taste and, i 'm tasting for salts.
but more importantly i 'm tasting for sugar right depending on how sweet your tomatoes are you 're definitely going to need to add some sugar.
here you may actually need a couple of teaspoons in here to get it tasting like you want.
alright , so i tested mine.
i starred in some sugar and some solved done.
after this is all blended, we 're going to just this again, at the end and then we 're going to take our immersion blender.
and we 're going to very carefully blend this absolutely smooth.
this is obviously edited, but you 're going to get blamed for at least a few minutes until it is smooth as silk.
and , because of the rice in there, the appearance is going to change from red to that more familiar sort of cream of tomato orange color.
at this point we 're going to add the last major ingredient of the cream alright.
besides a rice, that 's the other mandatory ingredient interdisc.
have cream, so will stir that in not sure why i 'm using the spoon or whisk would have been better.
but it 's too late i 'm not changing so?
we 're going to start that in at this point.
i 've taken it as far as i can go.
the rest is up to you, you need to adjust this until it 's absolutely perfect.
meaning if it 's too thick add some broth if it 's too thin, reduce it a little less switch to lay down here.
we 're going to need that, and then just as important as texture is the taste, taste this again like me, you may need to add a little more sugar.
maybe a little more salts who knows, you might even put a little more kayan in that 's been known to happen alright.
so like with most recipes, i do not want you just blindly following the ingredient amounts.
if you want this to work for your taste, you have to adjust, you are the sanjay, gupta of your suit shoot that was one syllable, away from being perfect.
but anyway, what i 'm trying to say is a justice with sugar salt and pepper until it 's like the best soup, you 've ever tasted and at that point, your tomato bisque is done that to some hot bowls.
just put a few bowls in the back of the stove while you 're cooking, they 'll be plenty warm enough by the time you read his serve of course, you could use a warm up in or maybe just keep them under your sweater.
but regardless we 're going to label that up.
i 'm gonna garnish with a little more fresh cream on top and some chopped basil just 'cause it goes so perfectly.
and you may remember this garnish from such tomato based suits as every single one.
i 've ever done and that right there ended up being a beautiful tasting and looking tomato bisque.
and because we use rice and not a whole bunch of ru or cornstarch the texture of this i think it tends to be a little silkier and smoother.
and you could see here.
mine is fairly thick.
or if you want to use a little thinner put a little less rice or a little more broth like i said very easy to adjust and if you 're wondering where the heck is the toasted cheese sandwich.
it 's right here.
alright everybody knows making tomato soup.
no matter what kind you 're making is simply an excuse to eat toasted cheese sandwiches, were not going to lie?
that 's actual purpose of this.
in fact, control room Q full, frontal in three two, oh, yeah, OK, that 's enough if you do n't mind.
i 'm gonna grab, a little piece of basil for this last bite that my friends was a beautiful, beautiful fall lunch.
so now you do n't need a whole basket of sweet vine, ripened tomatoes to make a delicious tomato bisque.
in fact, i will argue this comes out better because you do n't.
but regardless of what kind of tomatoes you end up using for this it 's an easy fast and fairly foolproof way to make a delicious and very, very comforting and satisfying style of tomato soup.
so i really do hope you give this brisca, try head over to food wishes, dot com, for all the ingredient amounts from the usual anna.
