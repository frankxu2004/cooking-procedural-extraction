today , we 're going to demonstrate oven, baked hash browns.
i love hash browns.
but unfortunately the oil is not as beneficial as if we could get the oil out and make it taste just as good and we 're going to show you a way to do that we 're going to start with a half a cup of raw cashews.
i 'm going to put in three quarters cup of water, a half a tablespoon of onion powder, a half teaspoon of garlic powder be careful with that.
because too much is going to take over as a dominant flavor and then two tablespoons of chicken flavoring.
i 've chosen mckays you can choose a different brand.
i like mckays, it has no MSG in the type that i get, and i 'm just going to blend those until smooth, and with a high speed blender.
it only takes a few seconds.
OK , that 's now smooth.
i 'm going to add that to eight cups of hash browns, you can get frozen hash browns and this would speed up the process of making it, you will need two pounds, which is equivalent to eight cups.
you just want to mix that mixture in with the hash browns where then going to cover it with a cup of finely diced onions, put it on our cookie sheet and then put it in the oven at four hundred degrees for twenty minutes or until the edges are getting quite brown.
you do n't want to leave it in too long because the edges will start burning.
so that 's pretty well mixed up, we 're going to add one cup of finely diced onions going to mix that in, and then put it on a cookie sheet.
you can use a nonstick cookie sheet.
i put a very slight amount of olive oil on this cookie sheet.
just so that the hash browns wo n't stick to it.
and then we 're going to put it in the oven, so that 's pretty well mixed up.
and we 're going to just place that onto the cookie sheet, you want to spread it fairly.
smooth uniform thickness do n't compress it too much.
and then we 'll put that in the oven for twenty minutes, and you will be amazed that this tastes.
so much like hash browns that you 've cooked in a skillet with all that oil.
so here we have our oven baked hash browns.
and there 's not a bit of oil except a little bit of oil that was in the cashew nuts when you eat this.
you 'll never go back to eating hash browns with oil, you can notice that it 's a little brown on the edge.
that 's what you want it to look like that tells you when it 's done.
the potatoes are cooked nicely through, and you can serve those up.
family will just love them enjoy.
