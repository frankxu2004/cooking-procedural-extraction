then , we know the amici.
my name is isabella merging TV, carrie ann.
i am your personal chef.
the very first thing of course, we want to do while we 're preparing the sauce is put the water in the boil, an of course to cook rather.
we have a beautiful hot of rolling boiling water right here now.
remember whenever you put your pasta in the water.
the one tip, i 'm going to give you if that water does n't taste like the ocean.
you 're doing your pasta and injustice.
remember , you only get one shot guys to make that pasta, taste like it wants to be so.
let 's start that up.
what we 're going to do is we 're going to heat up our saute pan.
and i 'm going to cut up some punch.
it to now punch, it is like an italian bacon, you need about a quarter pound.
you notice i have this actually sliced and there 's no rhyme or reason on how it has to be alright.
whatever is easier for you if you want to separate it.
because it 's easier for you to do it that way by all means we 're going to put this pancetta in the saute pan very shortly.
semantic fact, let 's get that butter in.
you want two tablespoons of butter.
here 's one and two clips.
pathetically now, we need the olive oil because the olive oil is going to keep the butter from burning.
so , let me just melt that down perfect, and i 'm going to throw the punch.
it in right now add a little more to go OK, perfect.
because you want to cook this.
but you want it nice and crispy while i 'm here.
let make sure you start that pasta, remember noble she pasta, and my cucina or yours for that matter, OK as i have this nice and low.
i 'm going to leave this here.
alright , let 's chop some onions as the fun shit that is cooking.
getting it nice and.
crisp , you want to take an onion.
i had a really large onion, and i did do that whole thing.
so i just cut it in half an all we 're going to do is, we 're just going to chop it, that does n't have to be.
you 're going to learn in my style of cooking that cooking is not scientific at all.
i do n't get myself crazy on how big the pieces are.
they do n't have to be exact.
i just want them in there and they 're almost the same there.
you go you notice i got another piece that i need to let go.
so , i 'm going to leave this right here.
notice , i also have my fresh tomato sauce that i made earlier.
i have some wonderful parsley because we 're going to need that, so, you know, what well, that punch it, that is, cooking, let 's take a nice handful.
a fresh parsley.
and let 's chop that up too, you know, how i feel about herbs by the way, you know, i always teach you a word or two in italian.
so i 'm going to teach you how to say parsley and, parsley and italian.
is brett similar?
i 'm going to say it one more time breath them below.
thank you, so here we go we got our parsley.
we have a run in stop that punch it has ready.
and we 're going to add the wonderful chopped onions that we just took care of she.
that 's how you say onions cheaper.
this smells heavenly.
i love the smell of unchecked fabulous.
it 's nice and crispy, and it has that wonderful saltiness to it, let 's get my herbs over.
i want my fresh tomato sauce anmi, prezzemolo remember how i talked to say that in italian, going to leave it right here.
where 's the vodka right here.
my friends right here.
let 's put it in right now.
do n't you love that sound?
we 're going to throw that in.
we 're going to throw the fresh tomato sauce in ah does n't this look beautiful.
do you notice that it takes no time at all to make these dishes?
and of course, we 're going to need the cream, but not just yet.
now , i know that pasta is ready how to turn this off and we 're going to drain it.
we 're going to drain this pastor right now, now while we 're draining do n't forget to put about a cup of the reserved pasta water.
pot a moment now.
what are we doing, we added this the vodka, we added the fresh tomatoes, i 'm going to add the cream?
now , now, i like using half and half, many people use heavy cream.
i prefer to make this as healthy as possible.
so i 'm going to use the half and half what else am i going to do.
i 'm going to add these beautiful herbs in pots set in.
and last but not least, i 'm going to taste this before we throw this pasta in can you see how beautiful this looks.
ah , this looks gorgeous model number years, my nana would say that simply deal, it 's your soul.
but you know, what i like a kick or get it through a little more red pepper, and this baby, we 're going to start up, and.
now i 'm going to take that pasta and take it and toss.
it right in just like this, now let me tell ya restaurant.
trick you never ever, ever sauce the pasta in the bowl that you 're serving it in you.
always , want to sauce the pasta right here in the pan.
because what you want to do is.
you want these flavors to marry, you want them to dis come together, and you 're going to see what happens if you let this simmer just for a few moments.
it 'll be perfect alright.
here we go i want you to see this gorgeous, gorgeous spicy penne pasta, love it with vodka and pancetta and herbs and A touch of cream.
you notice that it 's not heavy at all, watch this to me.
this is a fabulous dish and how long did it take not very long at all.
the only thing i would do is add a little bit of romano cheese, OK, a little more, 'cause i like my romano, and of course, i 'm going to taste it one more time, and i want you to see that 's amazing.
your family is going to want this for dinner.
