hi , i 'm very welcome to bettys kitchen today, we 're making a bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich or a BLT.
so if you 've been asking for sandwiches for the summer and you say, you do n't care if they 're playing or substantial just any kind of something that is a different idea for you.
so we 're going to do something very basic today, and that 's make the bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich an, i have chosen some white bread this is hardly white bread.
choose any bread there, too.
like if you like whole wheat or rye pumpernickel or any of those, just go ahead and toast it i just use a toaster.
so i did n't add any extra better.
i did n't heat up the oven.
i just posted it in my toaster.
we need to spread for it and i 'm just using the simplest of all mayonnaise.
so that will save a solemn fat calories, and i 'm just going to drop that along there.
so i can get back into my jar and get some more.
and then i 'll spread it.
so we 're just spreading one side of one of the pieces of bread with mayonnaise, an if you prefer miracle whip, that 's fine.
if you would prefer sandwich spread, which has some pickles and other things in it gives a little more flavor.
you might want to do that.
but we 're finished with our mandates.
now we just need our bacon lettuce and tomato always keep bacon in my freezer.
if you will keep that there, then there are.
so many dishes you can make and just put it in the microwave for like one minute, depending on how much you have it cooked annual, have nice crisp bacon like this.
so i have chris this up.
and i 'm just going to make sure i get these pieces separated so that they will kind of lie flat on here.
they do n't have to be perfect.
there 's some way.
get about three slices worth on their two and a half.
it 's perfectly but off at that open on, anyway, so we got plenty of bacon on an now we need some lettuce and tomato.
i 'd rather put the tomato in the middle.
i think it will just hang on little better.
i had some sliced tomatoes.
i was using for something else, and this is all i have left, but that 's fine.
you can put one nice big tomato slice or two small slices.
and then get some lettuce.
this is iceberg lettuce.
get some lettuce pieces that will leave that will laugh flat.
and you want those kind of outer leaves that are n't too curly because inside there early, and they do n't want to lie flat.
and that really, prevents you from making a nice flat sandwich.
just a little bit more here and then put the lid on it is that easy once you get it done in you can slice it.
if you want to slice corner to corner.
that 's fine straight down the middle like this is fine.
let 's just do kind of halfway diagonally.
so it 's a diagonal but not actually from the corners.
so i come back and put this on the plate and show you.
what it looks like then, an RV, LT looks like when we 're finished and you can do any variation on this that you like i 'm just trying to do the basic, and show you a little bit of accompaniment with quite a few unsalted, pretzels here and, if you olives just to give it some color and flavor to go along with the nice BLT, and it 's very manageable when you pick it up you can just bite into that and it 's not going to fall apart i knew.
although a little bit fell apart take it up.
so i hope you enjoy that sandwich.
