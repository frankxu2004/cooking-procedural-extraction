so today i 'm going to show you how to make the cold vietnamese spring rolls and blue dragon pretty much has everything you need for this recipe.
the spring roll papers, we have the vermis, ellie rice noodles voice and source and then up charm.
feed me stepping source, so let 's get started.
i 've got some hot water here in a pot.
take one out of the package.
we 're going to place it into the hot water and just soak it there for about five seconds.
and that 's as much as you need now.
you want to put it onto your cutting board and we have a variety of ingredients to go in we have lettuce coriander.
we have cucumbers, red peppers.
chilli slice mango mint and shrimps as well, so.
let 's get started an i 'm going to start with lettuce and what i 've done here with the rice for micelli noodles these i just soak them in boiling water for three minutes, and then rinse them off and they are ready and you can flavor them however, you like.
so these go into the center next.
i think i 'm going to use some cucumber and some red peppers so cut into julienne form.
we put it right in the center and what i 'm going to do now is start rolling it and what i can do.
i can do this in a couple of different stages, now.
i want the shrimps on the outside so you see the beautiful shrimps.
so i 've cut them in half, and i 'll put them facing out like this, and also mint which tastes fantastic.
and i want to put that right next to shrimps.
i 'm gonna start, rolling it, fold in the sides, keep rolling it up until you get one.
nice tight roll, and then all we do is we cut it on an angle and then we place it onto our platter.
now we need the dipping sources.
so we 're going to take the nap charm source.
and , so here 's one for dipping.
and , then we have a second source as well, this is the hoi sin and this is very typical to go with these.
and we 're going to top up with some chopped dry, roasted peanuts.
