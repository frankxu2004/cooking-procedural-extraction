if you 're cooking, a burger and you actually, using a frozen party like that, and on top of it, using some pre package bands, you 're doing it all wrong, if you think you make it easy on yourself it 's actually using a frozen burger at home specially if you 're coming home after a busy day i think it 's.
so wrong, i even have a hard time touching it, not even think, you 're cooking at that freezing burn.
they 're completely dry there.
probably grind at two years ago.
and that 's what you 're ending up in your house, so, of course.
now if you 're not going for the frozen one, you thinking, probably doing the right thing.
and actually buying some fresh ground meat.
for example, the one that i have right here it 's nice, bright, red, very fresh.
but it 's extra lean.
there 's no fat and it 's not fat.
it 's a boring burger.
never season the meat ahead of time because what the salt actually does to the burger it starts on curing the meat.
the texture is not the same you have ruining your burger.
another big mistake do not over here too, and heat the skillet.
if you underfeed, depend on you put actually the burger into the oil it will not seer therefore, the burger does n't seal.
and you will lose the juices from the burger.
if you overheat the fan, and you put the burger down at burger will never cook not even to the medium rare or medium side.
the outside will be already burned never close the barn too.
early because they only get salan, rubbery and a final mistake that i see people doing is cooking is burgers and then really pushing it down on the grill and what you 're actually doing.
there is squeezing out for the juices from the burger.
the result you ending up with us in party very dry on a soggy bun that.
so wrong now i 'm going to show you the right way how to do the best burger, first of all, you have to pick the freshest meat fat in a burger is.
so important because not only it adds, flavor put a burger.
but also, it adds that moistness look for some costly grind meat or buy a piece of meat and go to the extra work actually by hand, always think about using a nice piece of chuck or maybe some strip steak and then of course, the ultimate would be then.
the kobe beef, where really is the highest in fat content and as you make your party V adventures really think a little out of the box, mixing some ingredients into that ground meat.
for example, some sort mustard seeds some fresh herbs, some sauteed mushrooms, when you shaping, the burger always use a little bit of water on your hand.
so first of all, the burger and the meat does n't stick and you 're perfectly can shape.
that burger stuffing that burger either with the little blue cheese or really is going to work really well, or what i like to do or.
so having a little bit of leftover show grips.
for example, i put ashore trips in the center of the burger that brings like the burger to its whole different order level, do n't even think on using audio board?
you , some canola oil, oil who really supports nicely the heat and how do you know that actually your pan is really to the right temperature is when the oil smoke slightly.
the burger is probably the most important step.
you put the burger in the oil serious means.
you seal it and buy ceiling and means all the juices are staying inside thing about cooking it like a steak before serving it, let it rest a little bit.
so that the juices inside the steak burgers are distributed evenly.
now comes the fun part.
actually assemble burger.
so you 're starting with the band, always toast the bun.
or the last moment, that 's how you get really the bread showing at his best and what i like really is picking a bun like shea butter, for example, which has a nice golden crust on top of it think about using elevated pistol, you can use the freshest tomatoes.
of course, but you really living it up, you can push it to using a little bit of silt pineapple, you can use it.
karma lies onions.
so really the layers are if you do all the steps, right, you will end up with ultimate berg.
