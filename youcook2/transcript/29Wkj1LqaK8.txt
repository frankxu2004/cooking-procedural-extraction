well , and will come to jaconi magic.
it 's always a pleasure to have you here with me today.
one cup at a flower salt to taste, and an optional pinch of sugar makes everything well, and then proceed to add two tablespoons of vegetable oil rubbing the oil to the flour until it looks crumbly, and the.
next add luke warm water in small amounts.
the advantage of doing it this way is that it reduces the risk of you ending up with a dough that is on the sticky side, hence making it hard to handle or these two hard and hence your chapatis turn out hard once you do, comes together.
then you will proceed to the next step.
i like mine slightly on the sticky side.
once i 'm done because it gives me the softer parties that i 'm after pick oil slightly just a beaten OD on top.
this helps when you needing study does n't stick to your hand notice how my day, slightly on the sticky side.
so i need it by pinching and pulling it slightly away from me.
and i do this for about five minutes, by then.
the do stop sticking on my hand and it 's ready.
pick oil applied lightly.
and then take a clean fill or a dump kitchen table and cover you do for about fifteen minutes, and this is how it looks very soft and pliable proceed to divide it into lemon sized balls.
this is dependent on the size of your pan.
if you divide it into the lemon, sized balls, then you 're gonna end up with about eight to nine chapatis.
lightly dust your balls in the flower and shake off the excess flour.
the stretch it out a bit makes it easier to roll.
i also press mine down slightly with my knuckles and then i roll it out to about five to six inches, after which tick oil, and apply lightly.
do n't apply too much oil becaus this will end up with you having properties that are dripping with oil?
take your dusting flour again, and, please.
your rolls out two on it with the oiled side first, shut it down lightly then turn it over and do the same to the other side.
the purpose of doing this is the flower is going to help you to keep your layers distinct in separate placita newark surface and then fold it like a fan.
you see, that 's how you do it, so you fold stretch pat it, down, again, look at it again.
fold stretch patted down, once you 're done folding.
take it and press all your fold together, and as you 're pressing the falls together try and stretch it out slightly the next proceed to roll it out.
rather , all eat together and tucking your end, and as you 're rolling it apply a bit of tension and this is how it looks after about fifteen minutes of resting notice you cannot, even see the flower that we applied in between the layers again dusted before rolling it shake off the access flower press it down slightly to give it some definition, an shape and makes it easier to roll out proceeds to roll to a diameter of five to six inches and then meanwhile, ensure that you have placed your pan and heat.
so that it can warm up and your play a bit of oil using the kitchen towel or tissue this will prevent your chapati from sticking on your pan place it on the pan and let it stay for about a minute before you disturb it, you 'll notice the color changing and the bubbles appearing on top, you know, it 's time for you to turn it.
so comment on it and then apply your oil about a tablespoon i like doing mine from the edges.
because this makes it easier to spread the oil the chapati plan is concave in shape and.
so the oil automatically by gravity is going to flow towards the center.
now turn it over and apply oil on the other side again notice how i like applying my oil from the edges it flows towards the center and then i spread it, make sure you touch every part of that chapati, then turn it over and check the first site that was cooking if it 's not cooked your satisfaction you can always turn it back and cook it again in this instance it 's not cooked to my liking.
so i turn it over again and cook it for a few more seconds as i check on the second side, heights done.
second , sight is not done to my satisfaction, so i turn it over again and cook it for a few more seconds.
the first side i 'm happy with it.
so i wo n't cook it again.
the second side.
i 'm not satisfied.
and then i take the chapati off the heat in sub, you can serve it with a stew of your choice, it can be chicken curry beef still or just your normal vegetables and enjoy your meal.
thank you for watching it, keep it jaconi magic till next time.
