so for the month of january i 'm sharing with you guys.
my favorite breakfast recipes and today, and we 're going to making a bileti breakfast sandwich.
we 're going to be making our own avocado spread using spring greens, tomatoes, and of course bacon, it 's a super easy recipe that you can even make for your everyday breakfast.
so we 're going to start by making our avocado spread.
we 're going to need one ripe.
and we 're going to split in half and you want to remove the pit.
i 'm going to use a fork and just scrape all that flesh out of the avocado into small bowl and this way you 're matching it up anna.
moving in at the same time.
it 's a really simple technique.
we 're going to address from one line just kind of roll it on my counter to release all those juices from the flesh squeeze it into an avocado and this is going to first help preserve the color of the avocado and secondly, it 's going to give it a really zesty flavor.
actually this half looks like it 's perfect.
you go ahead and start in there.
i 'm also going to add about a tablespoon of olive oil.
it 's gonna add a little bit of creaminess.
we 're going to season it with just a pinch of salt.
i 'm going to give this a quick stir.
i 'm going to set it aside, and next we 're going to make her bacon to make our bacon super crispy.
i 've created my oven to three hundred seventy five degrees.
and i 've lined a baking sheet with some foil, and then placed a cooling rack over the top so to make our bacon.
we 're going to do is we 're going to laid over the top of the cooling rack, and once this is in the oven, it 's going to make a perfect bacon slice.
it 's going to be crispy.
you 're not going to have all that excess oil since it 's going to drip down to the bottom and make sure to align it with the foil in the bottom.
it 's going to collect all the fat and that 's going to happen you 're going to have super easy cleanup.
just throw the foil away in the garbage, so and pop this into the oven.
it 's going to take about ten, fifteen minutes for this recipe.
i like to use a firmer artisan bread, so you want to slice it into about half inch slices.
and then we 're going to place this on to pan, and i like to toasties under the broiler in the oven, it 's super fast and super easy.
so today i 'm going to make into sandwiches were going to four slices for today 's recipe, or, we 're going to be using sunnyside up eggs.
so the secret to making them is cooking them slowly over low heat.
so i 've sprayed a large pan with nonstick spray.
we 're going to add are eggs, and we 're going to let them cook slowly, and i like to use organic eggs simply 'cause the egg.
yolk is going to be raw, and you want to make sure you have the freshest best eggs.
we 're going to also season these with a little bit of salt and pepper.
my eggs and bacon or finishing up meanwhile, we 're going to start assembling the sandwich.
so we need to slice her tomatoes into nice thin slices.
so if toast my bread on one side and left it playing on the inside, so we 're going to spread to one side with the avocado.
spread that we prepared earlier and i like to add a lot of okada it 'll absolutely.
love it in my sandwiches.
and i want to get a bite of it.
every single bite spread that and then on the other side.
we 're going to add just A touch of olive oil mayonnaise.
and i like to use this olive oil mayonnaise, i think it has better flavor than just regular, plain old mayonnaise.
spread a little bit and you can add more or less to your liking and.
now , for assembly in our sandwiches were going to add a little bit of our spring greens over the top avocado spread.
lightly press them in, and then over our lettuce we 're going to add are tomatoes and this way.
the tomatoes are n't going to make the bread soggy and.
now for baking.
so once, i took it out of the oven, i just placed it on some paper towels.
they 're going to soak up any excess fat that 's on the top.
we 're going to add two slices for each sandwich, and you can break it up to just kind of layered over the top.
this perfect and now the finishing touch is there sunnyside awake, so you want to make sure you cook these eggs until the whites are completely set.
so you do n't get any food poisoning.
so we just want to slide this egg over the top.
and this is ready to be eaten.
and now it 's time to give her sandwich to try and actually prefer to eat these open face.
so there 's less bread and more sandwich, try to get a good fight out of this, this is absolutely delicious.
this is like the best breakfast sandwich.
ever i absolutely love this sandwich.
