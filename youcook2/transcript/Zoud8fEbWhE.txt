fattoush , salad is eleventeen salad made from toasted or fried pieces of pita bread and a variety of ingredients by eleven teen.
usually consists of egypt, jordan lebanon, palestine, israel, syria and parts of southern turkey.
now i want to cut the heart of a ovro, romaine lettuce into fairly small pieces like throughout the part that usually goes on a ham salad or ham sandwich.
and i 'm cutting this to fairly small pieces, not cutting it as small as you would, if you were making tabbouleh, and i 'm not even sure you could pick i sent tabouli salad.
but that looks like the limit of what i 'm going to get out of this heart of romaine choice.
in addition to the roaming lettuce cucumber green pepper.
so the suggestion for the recipe was green pepper and red pepper.
but red pepper is.
so incredibly expensive that i refuse to use it chopped, parsley chopped fairly fine, small chopped onion chopped green onion and finally chopped myth about two tablespoons i 'm also using tomato and since i live in america, and it 's impossible to get fresh tasty tomatoes i 'm using, i 'm using cans tomato which has been through throughout the tomato juice, and actually rinsed the pieces of tomatoes.
so the tomato juice would n't interfere with the dressing that i 'm going to make.
so i had to tomatoes and.
because somebody was kind enough to leave a little bit of goat cheese i 'm going to add that too, and this is the part that really looking forward to going to mix it up there it is looks pretty good to me.
now for the dressing i 'm going to be a little bit daring.
because let 's face it, i do n't know much about making dressing um and i want to have enough.
so that i do n't have to make, make anymore before the salad is going.
so i 'm going to put in what i think is about the juice of three lemons maybe four, maybe four, then.
let 's see what.
next i think i probably would never put in teaspoon or two of garlic.
because i know then i 'm going to add some regular mustard perhaps he 's kind of black pepper make a little bit of white pepper, too forget in between the black pepper, and i have a sense from reading several recipes.
but there should be some sweetness.
try a little bit of maple syrup, but not very much because there 's no disguising maple syrup.
if you get too much in too much there, but if it is i 'll probably had some and the rest would probably be extra.
virgin olive oil put it into this clean jars that looks pretty good.
one of the best things about the salad, aside from the obvious health benefits, easiest way to do this, is then served with pita chips, which could be homemade.
but a little too lazy to do that.
and i need to shake this, dressing up so here it is spell touche salad with mustard, and maple syrup dressing with peter pics.
it 's my favourites harder pulling recipe, not homemade.
but extremely interest.
