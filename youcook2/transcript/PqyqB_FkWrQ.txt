now take each bundle an loosen.
the strands bring a large pot of water to a rapid boil and then at the noodles stir.

so avoid overcooking them.
pour the noodles into a calendar.
now we rinse with cool water, several times to stop the cooking process.
toss , the noodles in the calendar shaking off as much of the remaining water as possible.
now spread the noodles onto a large plate and allow them to air dry while we continue with the next steps.
