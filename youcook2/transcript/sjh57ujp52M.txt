we 're going to be cooking some cortiva.
but you can do exactly the same recipe with haddock.
now we got the whitefish.
now i 've actually got phillips, so there 's no skin an, you know, supposedly, no bones as well, but be careful.
the bubble can do.
make up a nice little batter mix using plain flour, and i 've got a little bit of water is a fizzy water to get some bubbles in there.
'cause it means you get a nice lion crusty outside.
and you get really lovely fish in the middle.
so i 've cut me cut out what i 'm going to do is i 'm just going to season it so, and i 'm going to use a bit of black pepper 's world, i mean, dude after taste.
now what i 'm going to do is turn it round and season.
exactly the same money other side.
so i 've got it all chopped out seasoned on both sides that the next hunger to work on.
is the flower non using plain flour.
but what i 'm going to do is put little bit.
so and a little bit of pepper is really if you can season it all the way through it really adds to the flavor quickly to certain paper, in there?
just keep our lights and that 's ready for dipping the fishing with a move that aside and then we 're going to do is get on with the batter mix.
now to make the batter mix.
it is really very simple.
again you choose a bit of plain flour with the flower again.
put a bit of salt and pepper seasoning.
because build away for even the season food.
so the next ingredients go in is the fizzy water.
so it 's just spring water.
the bubbles really make it a lot better so poorly up again.
i 'm going to use a whisk for actually whisking out.
i can tell straight away we need more lord of altering that and just wish this out until you get it all nicely mixed out and try and get the last out sing only look at more flower in there start.
look , about right now, just thinking up slightly anyway.
so i want to get on with the cooking, and i 've got a non stick frying pan now.
i 'm just going to put some oil just going to use normal sunflower oil.
i mean, obviously if you got a deep fat fryer then great.
but i have n't got one of those.
so i 'm just going to let that get hot color pens getting really nice and hot.
now i can see all those sort of bubbles forming at the bottom there, so, i 'm just going to put the flower all round the fish triangular everywhere, give it a shake off and then what you do is drop it into the batter mix and then when you 've got the high oil just drop it in lights home and put 'em in slowly.
because it, it allows the batter to actually form a crust if you put in too quick it, it calls the oil down, just going to do free actually keep it simple.
and we 're going to put a little bit of oil ones.
heart just to get a bit of a crust, so we can flip them over.
and i 've got the fish in their turn, it down to us, or medium heat rather than the very high.
so we got our own about a medium heat, and i 'm doing just stuck in little bit of oil, so that.
when we turn it over, you know, the outside is all nicely encapsulated and dishes cooking inside.
and it 's gonna be really delicious.
i 'm just going to put this for about two minutes on this side and then we 're going to fit over for another two minutes.
what we 're looking to do is to get a nice golden brown color.
nice crispy coating cabin cooking for a cut lament in attorneys over another might turn it over one more time in the end, let 's start, looks really nice.
six golden brown, i 'm just carrying company for two minutes on this side and then with different over one more time.
so total cook time really is about five minutes.
on a medium heat popping cooking for that four minutes, it 's going to put those over already just put this side until it 's nice and brown on the bottom, and really, the server finish cooking wine.
how long is there is to come off, and i 'm just going to play some on a little bit of paper tissue just to let it drain off.
so when you serve him up, can all overly we 're going to travel for a certain right.
now for the surveys, are i 've got some really nice crispy homemade fries?
i 've made you see, you go really nice, coating there.
i can tell the crunchiness this is great.
i got it beautiful.
let me try to or caught really hot.
really lovely, though, is a nice fluffy light coating you ca n't go wrong with this recipe, and i 'll served out with some my crispy fries.
