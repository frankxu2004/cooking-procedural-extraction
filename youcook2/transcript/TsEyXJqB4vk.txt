it was n't until i had my first bond me that i realized the potential of the same game with maine.
i 've always eating always even saying my son of vietnam, i never have but even just the american versions.
i 've always eatin sandwiches.
i did n't even get it in vietnam.
i did n't even know it existed when i went to vietnam when i first had that thing on american soil.
it 's like why do other sandwiches exist, i know it so well balanced spicy, it 's juicy.
it 's crispy salty, but everything in the sandwich you could ever want answers perfect.
but you 'll ever have because the asians mixed with the french now, mike.
you 're probably wondering, why have a greater out here and why i have chicken is frozen i was out?
not so long ago, my god costco in a job and there has n't passing out these chicken meatballs.
and i tried one.
it was actually amazing.
is like this is costco chicken meatballs, is actually really good?
i was shocked that i saw the potential in a chicken meatball went home that day.
yeah , is like i saw the potential?
so what happened was, i realize how incredible serving chicken meatballs.
but i have a lot of trouble, finding not only good chicken that 's ground up.
but just ground up chicken at all.
you always see the ground turkey for the chicken.
meatballs become my favorite meatball, above the burger porgy.
there 's needles hard to get the really good ground chicken in the chicken value need to get it from the butcher, but apparently this guys got some techniques.
so i have n't quite figured out yet.
i 've been trying everything you can throw it in food processor, and you can blend you can freeze a little bit or just do it.
wrong blended up with herbs and spices and make great ground chicken that works great.
i 've done that.
so i have to press it.
i 've been trying everything i can have been cutting up the chicken theme.
i 've been pounding the computer lated fetus that just popped out of jackson.
i think i 've been pounding the chick in.
i 've been doing a lot, lot, lot, lot, lot of different things to make this work, and i just had a theory last night.
i was kind of frustrated like i ca n't figure it out.
i 'm just going to do the pounding that is serious like what.
if i froze the chicken and then grade it, i do n't know if it 's going to work if it does n't work.
we 're just going to have to do something else.
but i 'm thinking just like cheese, you know, if you want to be frozen, you just give it a great oh, my god working through working it is working folks, i think i am a genius.
so it may take a little bit effort.
but we 're essentially being your own ground chicken by grading it.
thing is i went online, and i was like other anyways to make ground meat without a meat grinder and without a blender and no one had any answer.
so i 'm going to do.
i 'm going to sit back and just accept defeat know, what ever accept defeat all my lord.
it works only took us through it did n't take that long.
but we actually, i threaded this chicken ground chicken.
we have ground chick in so i 've got picture.
i 'm like, i need some garlic if you want to cut some garlic out forming smashy smash.
so this is where you season your chicken and.
let 's say you already had ground chick in you.
could avoid that whole last step, and you can start the video right here?
and then you 'd be good to go.
he would n't be freezing your hands off.
but i really wanted to try it.
i actually feel really accomplished.
josh is creating chicken.
take some ginger little nob of it.
take a few cloves of garlic.
i want some more garlic than that.
my brother i want a lot of god links same, make it real fine 'cause you do n't want to necessarily be gnawing on ginger maybe you do, i do n't know.
maybe that 's why i think and cilantro of course, you can eat most of the stem.
so , do n't be afraid?
just had a leaves traditionally when it comes to fanmi, even though there are a lot of different fillings.
this sort of the main one is usually pork, and they usually have packed a, which is like liver and there 's a little bit of patane there, and then there 's some kind of barbecue poor usually three types, three types of pork.
so this is sort of a little bit more of an american version of it.
add some salt.
you can add a little pepper in there, if you want we got a lot of garlic and ginger, which is going to be like a little bit of joy, you could add some fish sauce at this point.
if you want fish sauce would be great, classic, vietnamese, ingredient, very intense correctly, like i want to get that pain going now.
that is, all we were going to be making.
got my meat mixture.
if you want you can just put a little piece in there and test it out.
i 'm going to make these little like, medium sized meatballs.
i want them to be able to cook in the pan without going into the oven, but drop them down there.
illaya balls down on here and just let them sit on one side until when you pick him up, they start to look.
nice and brown and then at that point once, that 's happening, then you can start to just flip them on the other side.
oh , my goodness.
gracious , and if you do these meatballs right.
they 're not exactly around, so you can actually flip them on like you do n't just cook him on one side and the other side.
come on every hit the system on all time.
get him as crispy as you humanly can, oh, yeah.
right turns down a little chicken meatballs.
i 'm telling you, if you 're not a believer, you will be a believer.
there 's something about the juiciness and the flavor and just this note.
i did use chicken thigh.
chicken breasts would not work very well.
i mean, you could try it with chicken, thighs meaty is fatty.
and it 's cheaper paper.
an it is, better, add a little bit of vinegar.
we 're using rice vinegar.
it 's nice and sweet and a little bit of soy shih, tzu boy that 's interesting and then a little bit of extra salt, the soya salty.
but we 're going to add a little bit of extra salt.
because this is pickles.
so what josh is doing here is he 's just shaving off the carrot.
and this is a great technique for instant pickles.
because it 's going to absorb the flavor, and it 's going to pickle immediately, we 're going to scrunch it into the sauce and you do n't need to have it sit in your fridge, or even outside for days, and then take some cucumber, which is a real game change.
here you gotta get in there and scrunch sometimes what they 'll do it.
the quick pickle is they 'll shave them first and then toss them in salt and sugar and if you talk to install in sugar the actually draw all the moisture, and then you rinse it off, and then throw it in there, if you have the time.
but their bun meat.
now yeah, so look what we 're doing here we 're just scrunching it where activating the pickle process and i 'm telling you instant pickles.
great personal quickel.
look what we did here.
look at that quick will go low there.
see that instant pickles give us a taste big lou, our final experiences, near we made the meatballs we have the workings for the most perfect sandwich ever created.
i toasted this bun if you can get a french baguette.
that 's the best.
but any good bundle was seeing this, this is the one thing that i felt like was missing.
and i was like there 's something missing about this sandwich would be shocked, but just raw cucumber.
if it 's not in there it does not taste the same.
you can leave anything out you can add anything you want.
but i 'm just telling you the best way.
i think wow veggies pickle, pickle and then fresh launcher was very important.
you 'll find that on every single bond, may you never wore it E lordy?
wo n't you buy and then eighties.
benz , we made a video before it was sweet.
chili and zesty mayo pretty much made it just for this sandwich because it 's the perfect combination.
oh , lauretti, you 're going to like shove.
this , in there to get it all in the sandwich.
if you really want to get crazy.
i saw one time someone even topped with fried egg michael this is the moment that the world has been waiting for the world.
being my stomach in my mouth.
the first time i set out to make this thing, i decided i want to make the entire thing.
bread included fred takes awhile.
it takes hours to make the bread, making the bread an midway through, i grab something that was four hundred degrees fourteen fifty degrees around my hand by accident.
prior little high burnt my hand so bad.
i blacked out.
i blacked out for a second woke up i could not keep my hand out of ice water for more than two minutes, seconds without it like burning horribly.
i was in horrible pain.
i remember that did n't care cook the entire meal that was left, made all the feelings and everything with one hand.
so much pain could n't play guitar can do anything.
the second, i took my first bite.
it was all worth it.
try this at home, if you need to first do some research and development go out and get a bond maine.
it will blow your mind music to my ears.
oh , my god.
