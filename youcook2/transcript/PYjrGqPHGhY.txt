hi , i 'm stephanie jaworski enjoyed baking dot com today.
we 're going to make buttermilk pancakes.
these are really easy to make.
you do n't need an electric mixer.
all you need is two bowls, one for the dry ingredients.
one for the wet and then you just mix the two together, and you 're done.
so we 'll start with the dry ingredients in a large bowl.
i have put one cup that 's a hundred and thirty grams of white all purpose flour and the flower will give us a structure to the pancakes and two that i 'm going to add.
one teaspoon baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of baking soda.
and this will give us light airy pancake.
the leviner and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt that 's for flavor and two tablespoons of thirty grams of white granulated sugar and the sugar not only add sweetness to the pancakes.
but it also gives some moist and it helps with the browning.
so i 'm just going to use a wire whisk, or you just use rubber, spatula and just stir everything together, want to make sure there 's no lumps and everything is blended OK, and that 's it for the dry and then for the wet, try to have everything at room temperature so, take, one large egg and i 'm just going to wish that.
now the egg gives a nice richness to the batter it binds everything together.
an plus it helps with the browning and then two.
then i 'm going to add three tablespoons to forty grams of butter that i 've melted.
and then let cool to room temperature annuar butter, adds moistness and gives it a nice tender.
nishan plus, of course, some flavor and what 's that in an last is one cup that 's two hundred and forty MLS of buttermilk and fire milk makes as opposed to milk and makes your pancakes more tender or softer.
now i 've used like a commercially made buttermilk.
you can make your own by just taking cup of regular milk and adding like a teaspoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to it and just let it stand for ten minutes, or you could use just have this product on hand.
i usually have it in the fridge buttermilk powder and then you can.
just you do n't have to worry about running out to the store just have it on hand.
it tells you on the back of the container.
how to use it.
so that 's our wedding gredients so just make a well in the center of your dry ingredients, and then add all your wet into the center there.
now we want to use a light hand when we 're mixing this.
because you do n't want to tough pancake.
so we do n't want to mix it over.
mix it just enough, i only mix it enough so that all the ingredients are blended together an when you 're just, stir gently.
anna few lumps is fine in a pancake batter.
now i 'm using just a rubber.
spatula , you could also use a wooden spoon and just gently stir these have a little more spongy texture than there 's a regular pancake recipe on the site they use is milk and the difference, is this is a little more spongy and light?
both are, good course, the buttermilk as a little bit of tang , OK.
so that 's it then we 're done.
so now to cook your pancakes, i 'm using an electric skillet.
if you have one of these turn your dial two, three hundred and fifty degrees fahrenheit that 's a hundred and eighty degrees.
if you do n't have this, just you can just use a frying pan on the stove.
try to use heavy pan with a flat surface.
you do n't want any warps in your pan.
because then you get uneven cooking, which we do n't want, and if you 're doing on the stove heat to medium, medium high, and what you can tell your pan is ready when you just take a little bit of water on your hands and just drop it on an oh kind of splatter that 's when you know, it 's hot enough.
so if you have to adjust your heat to get at the right temperature, and you might even have to adjust your heat as you 're cooking the pancake if it is cooking, too fast or too slowly, and just kind of upper down.
now i 'm going to just spray with nonstick vegetable spray.
my skillet that kind of cuts down on your fat, if you 're worried about that.
it 's nice and easy to do.
but you could use some oil or melted butter and you could either brush the oil or butter on with pastry brush or with a piece of paper, towel.
and then i 'm going to use just a ladle, of course, you can make your pancakes as big or small as you want if you do n't want, if you do n't have a label, you could just put this in a large measuring cup and then just pour it.
so i 'm just going to.
and give you if you 're going to put a lot of pancakes on your in your pan.
make sure you give enough room for spreading.
you can see this batter is really nice and thick from the buttermilk.
and i think depending on the buttermilk you buy summer thicker.
now the one i bought was really quite thick.
so then that 's going to affect the consistency of the batter.
so i 'm just so we could now if you have a non stick surface use a spatula, not of stainless steel.
she do n't scratch your surface.
so you cook these until the tops you get lots of bubbles and when some of the bubble start, bursting then you 'll know.
you could also just take your spatula and kind of just take a peek underneath 'cause you want the bottom to be golden brown, and this will take maybe depending on your heat to three minutes.
so you can see the top.
they 're starting to form some bubbles.
some of them are even popping so what you do is, i always like to just put my spatula and just check.
and i can see that the bottom is golden brown.
so just take your in just flip of course.
the more you cook the Z browner, and some people like there 's quite light.
i kind of, like the more the golden brown rolls and crisper and then just flip them and just cook the other side usually, uh, the second side does n't take as long.
plus you will notice at the bottom side.
does n't seem to brown quite as much as the top.
and that 's normal OK.
so pancake down as you can see the second site.
you kind of, it 's not a solid brown, it 's kind of patchy.
that 's how you want it, and i have the platter here.
now , i know the tendency is to kind of stack them.
but the problem with, that is, if you do that is, the bottom ones tend to get soggy.
so we do n't want that.
so try to have a platter or plate.
and then you can just space some flat like this, now if you were n't going to serve these immediately.
you could put them in a hundred and seventy five degree fahrenheit oven that 's foot eighty degrees.
celsius and just put them right on top of your wire rack, and they can stay there fifteen twenty minutes, and so, uh, if i wanted to another batch, i would spray again.
and then just give your better a stir now.
there 's two ways of say, you did n't want to make all of the pancakes, you could just store this batter, just cover it and store it in the fridge for usually like twenty four hours, and then just give it a real good stir, of course it 's not going to be quite as good.
but it 's still pretty good.
or you could just bake off all your pancakes and then just cool.
these , and you could put him in the freezer, and they last for about a month.
and , then you could either reheat them in the oven, just or you could just pop him right into your toaster oven, so until next time.
