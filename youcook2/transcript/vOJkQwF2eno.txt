hello , everyone and welcome to another episode of the cooking with riley show and today, i will be making pot stickers have that in a nice broth there, nice and steamy.
so first step is to make the dough and it 's just a very simple, though it 's just your basic dough recipe does n't have a lot of flavor.
but it gets the job done so our first step is to add some flour into a bowl.
you do n't need to sit this flower.
anything you can just dump it in straight from the bag.
so through that flower in there that 's two cups all purpose flour.
you do n't need to use any special high gluten flour for this in our.
next step is to add half a cup of warm water and.
now just using floured hands.
just kind of work this like i 'm doing here until it comes together into a ball.
then you 're going to turn it out onto your surface and flower.
that surface, as well, that 's about three minutes into the needing this is how you need it.
you just kind of pick it up.
flip it over and smash it with your hand.
and you 're just going to want to need this until it 's nice and smooth like we have here and to make the rappers there two different methods.
i 'm going to show you a two different easy ways.
this is my favorite one right here.
you roll it out with a rolling pin, then cut it with like a cookie cutter or cup.
but this does take awhile and this is kind of tedious work.
so you just go on a roll, it out until it 's a nice even thickness.
and that took me about twenty, twenty five minutes.
so you 're really going to want to roll it out until it 's like this thickness very thin, almost as soon as you can get it.
so i 'm just giving a nice another role here to make sure everything is all even text or not texture.
even thickness sorry about that, that 's looking great.
so our next step is to take a cup or something like that.
i just used a big cup and cut out circles, and the reason is a cup, not a knife, so they all stayed the same shape.
and you just wanna do close together like i realized i need to do here.
so use all that though that you can, as you can see here i 've used it all up and i 'm just going to need it i do n't.
wanna waste that dough need it back together and show you the second method, so for the second method, you roll it out into a log, your dough.
and you 're just going to take us a rated knife cuts thick chunks like that, and it 's sort of like neo key.
the process that you 're doing here.
so just cut all your dough into thin strips.
ann , you 're just going to roll this out the reason, i do n't like this too much.
because it can either get too long or too wide, it 's hard to get into a circle like you want.
but just do the process, and i 'm as i 'm doing it here.
i usually just roll it out really thin and then cut it with a cup and this is what you 're left with we got some pot sticker wrappers.
so now let 's get started on her feeling.
so for the filling only ground pork is just a bowl of the mexican.
some salt and pepper chicken stock so soy sauce sugar, garlic, and ginger scallion, and toasted sesame E oil.
and of course, our pot sticker wrappers, so, let 's get started on that feeling, so let 's drop our ground pork into a bowl.
add the garlic and ginger add the sugar.
add the soy sauce.
add the toasted sesame E oil.
i just wanna make sure you get everything out of the bowl as you can see.
i missed some soy sauce there.
an ad you scallion.
and you 're also going to want to season this lightly with salt since there is lots of salt and soy sauce.
and you 're going to want to season heavily with black pepper gives a nice generous.
seasoning so now using any utensil that you have on hand, just mix it up until it 's all mixed together.
and this is what you 're left with.
so now let 's folder pot stickers.
i 'm not very good at this.
i hate to say it.
this is my first time, making pot stickers.
so , do n't use my tips as you can see?
there 's some irregular shaped ones in the back, you just want to kind of make it kiss at the top like cannoli, if you 've ever made those before, and then you 're going to want to pinch it and fold it to your only going to want to pinch one layer, fold it to the first or the other layer.
sorry , not very good, at this, as i said before.
just you could probably find some better tutorials on youtube do n't take my instructions, but you kinda wanted that shaped like that.
it 's kind of like almost like a little purse.
so now you just wanna use a repeat.
that process, of course for all your dumpling wrappers in your feeling.
now , we 're going to get on to the cooking process, so into a large pan.
i have some canola oil that 's been heating up for a little while, just going to drop are pot stickers in there, you can fill up the whole pan.
you do n't worry about not crowding it in my camera went a little focus there, did n't want to cooperate?
and you just want to brown the bottoms lately, and that will take a few minutes now.
the stage are bottoms are getting a little bit brown.
and this is where you 're going to want to add your chicken stock and soy sauce.
and you just want to give a panel.
it 'll shake to make sure they 're not sticking every once in awhile, so since you can stock it will sizzle a lot at this stage.
and you just want to be careful when you 're doing this.
it could catch on fire, the hot oil.
anne , i decided i did n't have enough chicken stock there, so i added some more straight from the carton.
this is about half a cup to three quarters of a cup of chicken stock, and you never want to let the pan dry out in this process.
so add your soy sauce.
it 's about tablespoons soy sauce and cover.
going to want to cover that an let them steam for about eight minutes and tell the pork is cooked through an.
that 's what you 're left with just a beautiful pot sticker.
so now you can serve these anyway.
you like i did it in a nice chinese chicken broth and talked with some green onion, so thanks for watching guys, riley out.
