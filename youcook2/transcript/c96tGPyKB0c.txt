fresh pizza, dough basil, some tomato sauce olive oil, and mozzarella cheese that can only mean one thing that 's right today.
we 're making pizza margherita alright.
so the first thing what we have over here is sixteen ounces of though i 'm going to get it stretched out.
let 's see, how accurate i am.
yeah , i think i know what i 'm doing alright.
so , first we 're going to do the sauce, the sauce is very basic.
all i did was take symbolic one tomatoes, throw in a little bit of our salt.
pepper olive oil, and actually some basil and they 're and we 're going to get the spread around K.
next to some diesel.
now a lot of people there is a debate on whether to put the basil on before or after.
i actually do a both times i 'm going to put some on before and then we 're going to top it with a little bit later on.
now we have whole milk.
yes , you can only use whole milk mozzarella basically in blocks, and.
now i 'm going to put this in our pre heated oven, which is preheated at five hundred, and twenty.
so here we are about halfway through, and we 're.
now going to slide it off the pan i put it directly on the rack and every couple minutes we 're going to come here and turn it, and we should be done pretty soon and here we go.
it is now done, took about maybe ten twelve minutes.
last step is we 're just going to drop off some fresh basil on it and one last thing listen to this nice crispiness.
thank you for watching everyone.
