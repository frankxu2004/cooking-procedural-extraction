for sure this is actually inform fam, fatel dot com.
today , i 'd like to share with you.
the art of making the perfect bunny sandwich by me.
i 'm getting very popular in the US, and you 'll find body shops everywhere in the bay area.
and i 've seen a lot of them in new york, and i 'm going to show you how easy it is to assemble at home.
so let 's start today.
i 'm going to make the filling with vietnamese meatballs.
it 's called symbolizes sucker, an here is still warm and smells very good will need a baguette.
i bought it, but, you know, if you want to make it at home, you can follow the recipe on my cookbook.
it 's actually called red meat.
and here 's what we 're going to make today.
is the people, um, feeling today, we 're going to need the signature element of the binary which is pickled icon and carrots.
so we 're going to need the diakon first here 's how it looks like if you do n't have the icon?
an you can use like a substitute, you could use radishes.
but uhm or just kids, and we 're going to cure it first i 'm gonna get a knife there.
you go make long ribbonlike slices of the radish, i think that 's enough, but, gorgeous with the same thing with carrots got carrots, and here 's a care died by the market was.
so cute is doing the, the sign.
but anyways, so you do n't want the carrot peels should be too thin.
because you 'll lose some of the crunchiness of the, of the carrot.
so i use, uh, like fairly thick peeler.
so let 's do the same with the carrots.
so the diakon in the carrots are just a substitute of the french punishment in the traditional jumbo, jumbo girl sandwich, and basically the, it 's.
because the, the french pickles were.
so expensive that vietnamese people try to find ingredients that they could they were available in land and just make them taste as closely as possible as the costly french products.
so it 's not that complicated to just cut into street.
all you have to do is use unite as a leverage.
you point to the tip of the knife.
and there 's and just like do that like motion back and forth and you have those like in string in no time.
so i 'm gonna get the same thing with the diakon.
let me show you the profile so you can see it better.
OK , i 'm going to get it all, all the carrots, and i come together.
let 's move this cutting board over here.
you can add.
hello , white vinegar, or lemon juice, i would usually put white onion.
but this version of decided not to go with the onions 'cause i 'm gonna add a little bit of menton, beansprout instead.
let 's add the sugar and mix it together.
the other element of a bon.
sandwich is the butter, so try to use a quality butter an vietnam.
the most sought out an ingredient is the belleville ten, which is the butter from brittany ann.
actually , you can find it here.
but it 's kind of costly and i could n't go that far, so i got some european irish butter anything.
it 's really yellow, just put it to a little temperature is easy to spread i, gotta get, i 'm going to remove some of them inside.
so we can put a lot of the all the filling inside.
spread a little bit of butter, see.
and then spread it, and one side, the other side you gonna use mailings, i just made it an, it 's, is still getting like a little thick?
so i 'm gonna finish with more line.
you want something that is very refreshing and that line really brings that right taste to the condiments.
so soon going to spread the mail on the other side.
we have some meant.
so this is vietnamese met, you know, the veins are a lot deeper than the regular mint.
and i planted it myself.
but you can find spearmint at the asian grocery store, or just use regular mint.
and i 'm gonna use cilantro.
so i 'm gonna share the leaves if you decide to cut them.
it will bruise the leaves and they all dark and a lot faster.
so , let 's do this, the pickle carrots are ready.
they 're going to be crunchy and very tasty.
i added a little bit in spot for extra crunch.
we 're going to add the meatballs.
how delicious illa.
and then add the signature element with the carrots and pickles.
cyclone , i 'm gonna add a little bit of this meet.
enclose a sandwich.
the last thing is to add a little drizzle of maji, which is close to soy sauce you can find it in many asian grocery store.
it 's a little pricey.
this one was three dollars a bottle, but if you do n't have it, you can add just regular sources.
but this is such a expect expensive product, because it 's imported from france.
but you do n't have to use measure.
you can use ice.
i thought it added a little salty ness to the bread.
there you go my sandwich is ready, and so yummy.
the meatball is very.
soft , and the crunch news from the carrot and in stroud at them over those texture to the sandwich, so see how easy it is to assemble.
