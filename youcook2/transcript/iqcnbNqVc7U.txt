breakfast is not complete without a great hash brown.
and this is how you make it, it 's really, really simple.
you get yourself a nice big part of potatoes and salted water.
so i 'm just going to pull my potatoes in there, it can be cold a generous pinch of salt.
we cook them until there about three quarters of the way through.
so it 'll be about ten to fifteen minutes, depending on the size of your potatoes, so we bring it through our rolling boil.
i 'm going to great them when they 're three quarters of the way cooked.
still , warm, i 'm going to mix it with a little bit of cornstarch or cornflower.
some fresh thyme leaves, which i 've got over here.
you wo n't need much salt.
because we 're cooking it in quite heavily salted water, and that 's it 's really, really simple recipe i 've got some potatoes that are already cooking if you want to check that there 's sort of three quarters of the way cooked.
so get yourself a little skewer, poke it in you should still feel some resistance you do n't want them fully cooked, and these are just there.
so i 'm going to pull them out you let them steam dry for just a minute or two until this sort of cool after handle and then you 're going to great them.
so i 've got my semi cooked potatoes here what i 've got is a box grader and a little bit of parchment paper.
so you literally just you can do this really roughly that you can even hear the texture.
see the potatoes still rather firm in the center which is what you want.
but it is semi called maybe enough about that in my bowl the reason, i do it on this little bit of parchment is simply.
be cause you can just pick up the piece of paper and take it straight over, and then you can mix just a little flavor through.
so i 've got some fresh thyme.
leaves sprinkle, those in lovely perfume just a little bit of salt.
we already put some salt in the cooking liquid, so you do n't need too much.
just a couple of tablespoons of corn flour, two or three tablespoons full, then you just sort of mix that together, and you 'll see the moisture of the potato will actually eventually take on all of that corn flour that we put in there.
so , once you have you mixed complete.
what you want to do is just set it to one side.
get yourself a tray.
you can take that little bit of parchment paper that you used earlier, and just sort of lay that on the bottom of your on the bottom of your tray, then you put your potatoes on top of the paper, and then you just sort of press them into the tray.
you want it to be really nice and firm, now, of course, the thickness of this potato will be the thickness of your hash browns.
so we 're not coding it in anything.
it 's going to be that, that fixed, so if you want them nice and thick, then of course, you can leave the layout a little thicker.
i take one more piece of parchment on the top and just kind of smooth it out, it 's that simple.
your property into the fridge.
once it 's cold, you can cut it into any shape.
you want and then we just cook them in a little bit of vegetable oil really crispy and really delicious.
so potatoes are in the fridge they 've been there for about twenty minutes.
so they should be nice and cool.
let 's take a look perfect.
so just want to make sure that their firmed up and they are nice and cool and then this is how you get them out flip it over, then i 'm going to go down here just cut it into nice long strips, you can turn it this is why i keep it on the parchment paper 'cause it gives you a good sort of move ability i 'm going to cut them in squares.
now if you want to cut them from there into triangles, you can really, whatever shapes, you like next.
you get a hot pan.
so i 've got a pan over here with just a little bit of oil, move that around, you can use a little butter as well.
so the oil, of course allows you to get it to a slightly higher temperature and the butter.
gives you that beautiful flavor.
once you hash browns and golden on both sides.
you can lift them up to sit them straight onto some absorbent paper, the beautiful thing about these hash browns is there super crispy on the outside.
but on the inside there still, delicious and fluffy give him just a second on the paper, and then you can pick them up just stick them straight onto a plate.
of course, the perfect thing to serve with some fried eggs and bacon or grilled tomatoes, you can also serve them with hot chili sauce, or even and applesauce and sour cream is.
so many different ways to enjoy hash browns and how to make him get busy.
