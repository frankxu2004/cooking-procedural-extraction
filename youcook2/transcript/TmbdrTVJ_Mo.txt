want to make a sandwich.
i 'm gonna use, some flower herbs de provance, dijon better greer.
you swiss if you do n't have free air, some ham, and i 'm going to warm this milk up in the microwave.
so we need milk and some nutmeg.
and some bread, and let 's get started going to start this out with using a tablespoon of butter melting that down and tablespoon, all purpose flour.
it might be just a bit over a tablespoon that 's OK, we want to cook this for about a minute.
i 'm on just below medium heat.
not real, hot and will let that cook for about another thirty seconds to a minute does bubbled, away just for a minute total.
wanna add warm milk.
i put in the microwave.
this in must 've going to add just a little bit of white pepper.
a little bit of salt anne just a dash of nutmeg and allow this to thicken when it comes to a boil or gets real hot.
it will thicken just take it a couple minutes.
so this is a bubbled up and thick and i let it bubble for about a minute and a half going to add our cheese it 's about a half a cup of cheese or just go ahead and turn the heat off and let that cheese melt in and start making their sandwiches will just let this sit here and cool off.
take your toasted bread.
i put it in the toaster, sliced it toasted it man.
but just, just a taste of mustard just for flavor on each slice of bread man your ham please do n't be cheap with your ham at a decent amount on here.
these are going to be some of the best in my opinion.
some of the best ham and grilled cheese sandwiches, you 've ever had just like that, maybe a little more there more here, samir, greer or swiss, if you 're using swiss, do this is it looking?
